                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921), who met Whitman on the streets of
                    Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
                    commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
                    was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
                    men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
                    write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span>

                    James Russell Lowell (1819–1891), an American critic, poet, and editor of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic</span> who had died a month prior to this
                    letter. One of Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, Lowell was committed to
                    conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's more
                    experimental form. Still, as editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic
                        Monthly</span>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
                    Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
                    titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
                    contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
