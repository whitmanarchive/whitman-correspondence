        <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">At last I am beginning to receive from the bindery the second batch of my late Two
        Volume edition (I print 600 copies each Vol.) &amp; send you a set in the new
        binding, by this mail. I am now at last also supplying my English subscribers &amp;
        friends their Vols.—have sent their books, postpaid, by same mail with this to
        several of them (see list appended)—&amp; the rest will follow, until every one will be
        sent—probably within the next ten days. I sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> the
        Vol. for Mrs. Matthews, as the address was too indefinite—How about G. W.
          Foote and J. T. Nettleship mention'd by you &amp; giving
        extracts, under date of May 23d? Their
        names do not appear in the lists you have given me to send books to. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span> folks have sent me good pay for the little
          poem,
        but I have had nothing, &amp; heard nothing from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Examiner</span>. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I expected to have heard of Mrs. Gilchrist's arrival in The U.S. &amp; to have had perhaps
        ere this the great happiness of meeting her—but have heard nothing up to
        date. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My letter of June 26, speaking of the situation, the delay in printing this second
        batch, &amp;c.—And my letter of July 3d acknowledging yours of June 20,
        enclosing one £45-9-6, &amp; list—you have. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I enclose herewith a later circular—will send you a dozen or so soon. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My dear little baby-nephew, &amp; namesake, is dead, &amp; buried by the side of my
        mother, a bitter cup to me—Otherwise things are about the same with me as
        before—&amp; I am jogging along about the same. </p>
