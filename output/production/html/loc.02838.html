        <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">At last I am beginning to receive from the bindery the second batch of my late Two
        Volume edition (I print 600 copies each Vol.) &amp; send you a set in the new
        binding, by this mail. I am now at last also supplying my English subscribers &amp;
        friends their Vols.—have sent their books, postpaid, by same mail with this to
        several of them (see list appended)<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—&amp; the rest will follow, until every one will be
        sent—probably within the next ten days. I sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> the
        Vol. for Mrs. Matthews,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> as the address was too indefinite—How about G. W.
          Foote<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> and J. T. Nettleship mention'd by you &amp; giving
        extracts, under date of May 23d?<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Their
        names do not appear in the lists you have given me to send books to. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span> folks have sent me good pay for the little
          poem,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
        but I have had nothing, &amp; heard nothing from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Examiner</span>. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I expected to have heard of Mrs. Gilchrist's arrival in The U.S.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> &amp; to have had perhaps
        ere this the great happiness of meeting her—but have heard nothing up to
        date. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My letter of June 26, speaking of the situation, the delay in printing this second
        batch, &amp;c.—And my letter of July 3d acknowledging yours of June 20,
        enclosing one £45-9-6, &amp; list—you have. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I enclose herewith a later circular—will send you a dozen or so soon. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My dear little baby-nephew, &amp; namesake, is dead, &amp; buried by the side of my
        mother, a bitter cup to me—Otherwise things are about the same with me as
        before—&amp; I am jogging along about the same. </p>

                    (1850–1915), a freethinker, was the author of many pamphlets attacking
                    Christianity. Foote did not forward £3 to Walt Whitman. Rossetti mentioned on
                        <a href="loc.03621">August 17, 1877</a>, that he had called the
                    failure to pay to Foote's attention. Whitman received a letter from Foote in
                        <a href="loc.02048">February or March 1878</a>, who promised to send
                    the sum, which he alleged had been stolen by an employee. After the entry the
                    poet later wrote "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fraud</span>." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02838_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02838_n4"><span>For Nettleship, see

                    children arrived in Philadelphia on September 10, 1876 (Commonplace Book,

                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Though Gilchrist had come to America to
                    accomplish in person what she had not been able to accomplish in her
                    letters—to become Mrs. Whitman—she was practical enough to arm
                    herself with letters of introduction to various Americans. Rossetti, her shrewd
                    and somewhat snobbish advisor, wrote on August 23 and 24, 1876, to various
                    painters and to Charles Eliot Norton (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
