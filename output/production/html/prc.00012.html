                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> announced that Sheldon and Co. had assumed
                    financial control of the journal. The reply to this letter is in the Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1868 was more
                    than kind to Whitman and his friends. In March appeared O'Connor's satirical
                    poem "The Ballad of Sir Ball," 328–333, about the authorship of Florence
                    Percy's (Elisabeth Chase Allen) "Rock Me to Sleep." Of the poem Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman wrote on <a href="duk.00541">March 24, 1868</a>: "it is
                    signed W. i hope nobody will think you wrote it walt." In April the magazine
                    printed John Burroughs' "Before Genius," 421–426, in which he observed:
                    "If we except 'Leaves of Grass' and Emerson's works, there is little as yet in
                    American literature that shows much advance beyond the merely conventional and
                    scholastic." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
