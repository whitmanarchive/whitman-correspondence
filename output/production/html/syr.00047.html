            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 27<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> to hand this morning by mornings mail. So it took from 8 P.M. 27<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> to
                10 A.M. 30<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> (2 days &amp; 14 hours) to travel from
                    Phil<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a</span> to the asylum, much to long—the
                postal service is not at all what it should be on this continent—not half what
                it is in England [/] (I do not know how it is on the Continent of Europe). [—]
                Yours of 28 also to hand by this afternoon mail (it
                seems to have done better, I judge it made the trip in just about two
                days—letters never come in less time than that—they ought to come in a
                little over a day. I have seen nothing about Tennyson's
                illness, too bad such men must grow old and die—he is a grad fellow, ought to
                be immortal (will be, I hope). I get the O'C. cards and glad to get them. O'C. seems rallying finely again and if the fits would only keep off
                he might have a long pretty good spell—but I fear much they will not keep off
                for long—seems as if they had come to stay. Am greatly pleased to see that you
                are going in strong on the massage. [/] I hope for the best results from it. I send
                you my list of misprints—guess you have them all already—have found no
                new ones lately—not looking for any—no time. The "Saturday" came from
                O'C. yesterday, read it and was much amused. These
                polished [mutilation] litterateurs are as blind (half of them) as if they had been
                born without eyes. Then when others see something they cry out "nonsense, you only
                think you see something [/] it is all a delusion there is nothing at all there to
                see!" I have written to M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span>K. as
                follows: "Please let Mr W. have any copies he wants of my W. W. in sheet or
                otherwise free of copy right"</p>
