I do not know whether the subject of the poem (the growth and development of the artist-nature, and its relation to life) will much interest you, but I hope you will here and there find something drawn immediately from nature.  I am, at least, not aware that anything in the book is simulated or forced:  whether successful or not, it is an honest conscientious effort.</p>

               not one of those who overlook your remarkable powers of expression, your broad, vital reverence for humanity, because some things you have said repel them.  The age is over-squeamish, and, for my part, I prefer the honest nude to the suggestive half-draped.  I think the proper question to be asked is:  does a certain thing need to be said?  If so, let it be said!  The worst form of immorality, I have found, veils itself in decent words.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is one quality I recognize in you, which warmly and constantly attracts me.  That is, your deep and tender reverence for Man—your un-

                    journalist, and traveler. His letter of <a href="loc.00872">December 2,
                        1866</a>, was even more unreserved in its praise. Later Taylor's
                    enthusiasm for Whitman was to change dramatically. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Echo
                        Club</span> (2d ed., 1876), 154–158, 168–169, Taylor burlesqued
                    Whitman's poetry. William Sloane Kennedy lists him among Whitman's "Bitter and
                    Relentless Foes and Villifiers"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of a Book for
