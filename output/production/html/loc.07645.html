            <p class="tei_p">Pleasant weather warmish but not hot—my body strength &amp; head grip low ebb
                still—not much different—no going ahead &amp; no serious ebb—a bad
                day yesterday, brain thick &amp; body sluggish—but to-day quite a movement
                bowel quite decided—used (instigated) (by a little syringe a little longer than
                your small finger) a small injection of glycerine—young Dr. Mitchell suggested
                it yesterday afternoon—I feel better I suppose as I sit here, but my head is
                thick yet— A good letter from John Burroughs this morning—all as usual with
                him—(a dear friend personal &amp; literary)—</p>

                will read a second time—I turn around &amp; eat a couple of nice California
                pears. I send you pp 82 to 92 inclusive proof sheets, those are all the printers given
                me to date—I am still sitting up—have my dinner ab't 5—(now after 3 &amp; I
                got up ab't 10½)—am middling comfortable—quiet
                afternoon—Shall lie down on the bed—generally fair spirits—</p>
