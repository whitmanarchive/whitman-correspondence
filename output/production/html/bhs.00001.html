                    was a Brooklyn official acquainted with Whitman. Bergen was a member
                    of the 241st regiment of the New York State militia, where he achieved the rank of Colonel. 
                    Trained as a surveyor, Bergen enjoyed
                    a succesful career in the field before turning to politics. He served on the
                    Kings County Board of Supervisors as the Supervisor of New Utrecht for
                    twenty-three years (1836–1859). In 1864, Bergen was elected to the United
                    States House of Representatives as a Democrat. He held this
                    office until 1867. </span></span></p></div>
