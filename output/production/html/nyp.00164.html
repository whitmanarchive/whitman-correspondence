I was going to start right of to see him I would have come long ago but he thought not, so did you. this time I intended to go whether anyone thought best or not but the same eve Liut Perry came bringing us the sad news of his death but did not tell us any of the particulars</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Whitman will you be so kind as to tell us all the particulars concerning Oscar was he expecting death to come so soon or did he leave any messages for us. the least thing from him will be interesting to me we were not expecting to hear of his death as all the news we got were favorable of late nor can we realise it yet we will try and submit to Gods will and feell that he does all things well  we hope our loss is for his gain. I feel that you was Oscars friend and will be ours and again we thank you and will ever feel grateful to you for the kindness you have shown. I hope to hear from you soon yours with respect</p>
