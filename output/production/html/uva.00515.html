            <p class="tei_p">Your kind letter of Dec. 23, with the £81 over, has safely reached me. I thank you, dear <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pall Mall
                    Gazette</span>, &amp; deeply thank the donors of the
                    gift—It is accepted, I am sure, in the same
                spirit in which it is conveyed—And I must add that (while I am not at all in
                actual want, and have generous and attentive friends here) a money aid like this
                comes most opportunely to me under the circumstances, and helps "keep the wolf from
                the door" indeed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am almost entirely physically disabled, but remain in good spirits and fairish
                health. Almost every week I write a little for pay and publication. Winter is at its
                height and bitter cold here now, the earth hard and covered with ice and snow, as I
                sit by my window well blanketed, writing this offhand letter of acknowledgement.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">God bless my British friends assisters—(from the first they have come in when
                most wanted)—</p>
