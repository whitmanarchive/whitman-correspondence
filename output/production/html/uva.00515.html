                    gift<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—It is accepted, I am sure, in the same
                spirit in which it is conveyed—And I must add that (while I am not at all in
                actual want, and have generous and attentive friends here) a money aid like this
                comes most opportunely to me under the circumstances, and helps "keep the wolf from
                the door" indeed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am almost entirely physically disabled, but remain in good spirits and fairish
                health. Almost every week I write a little for pay and publication. Winter is at its
                height and bitter cold here now, the earth hard and covered with ice and snow, as I
                sit by my window well blanketed, writing this offhand letter of acknowledgement.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">God bless my British friends assisters—(from the first they have come in when
                most wanted)—</p>

                    Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) the amount was
                    £81.6.6 ($393.61), which Walt Whitman deposited in the bank on January
                    11. Norman was acting for the editor of the newspaper, William T. Stead
                    (1849-1912); see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>, XXXIII (1961),
                    68-69, and also the letter from Whitman to William T. Stead, <a href="med.00750">August 17, 1887</a>. On <a href="loc.00720">February 3</a> Norman protested to Whitman the citation in the
                    Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> of the names of three donors: Sir
                    Edward Malet, the English ambassador in Berlin; Lord Ronald Gower; and A.
                    Gerstenberg. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> devoted a great deal of
                    space to Whitman in 1887: January 10, excerpts from "My Book and I"; January 20,
                    lengthy extracts from "A Word about Tennyson"; April 27, a quotation from
                    Whitman's "Additional Note" for the English edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>; May 6, an excerpt from a private correspondent about
                    gifts of Americans to Walt Whitman (see 1597); June 2, an account of Walt
                    Whitman's birthday with quotations from the Daily News; July 9, "The Dying
                    Veteran"; July 30, a summary of Swinburne's attack upon Walt Whitman; August 3,
                    4, 6, and 11, comment, editorial and personal, on Swinburne's article; September
                    6, a defense of the American poet. In addition, letters from Walt Whitman were
                    reproduced on January 25 and August 30 (see the letter from Whitman to Stead of
                        <a href="med.00750">August 17, 1887</a>). The endorsement of the draft
                    letter (Clifton Waller Barrett Literary Manuscripts Collection, University of
                    Virginia) reads: "Sent to Henry Norman | Pall Mall Gazette | London | Jan 3
                    '87." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
