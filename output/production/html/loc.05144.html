                of this day is cramped by formalities and proprieties to an inconceivable
                extent—far more so than in England. Art in all branches is thought of as a
                technique—anything like strong individuality is despised—or if it
                happens to escape that fate is overtaken by a still worse one, in being lauded as if
                it were a piece of correct conventionalism like everything else. <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">—I have known this with the L of

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The
                    lecture was published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ueber Wordsworth und Walt
                        Whitman</span>; Zwei Vorträge von H. B. Cotterill und T. W. Rolleston
                    (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston gave a humorous account of the Dresden society in
                    "The Literarischer Verein of Augustusstadt," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Dublin
                        University Review</span>, 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
                    signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
                    criticism. Rolleston also commented on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
                    which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claimed that "Walt
                    Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
                    he was treated from a more exlusively philosophical point of view." After the
                    joint publication, in pamphlet form, of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ueber Wordsworth und
                        Walt Whitman</span>, a good part of it was translated into English by Horace
