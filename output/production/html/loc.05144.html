            <p class="tei_p">'Specimen Days' safely arrived, a really beautiful book externally. Many, many thanks for the gift. I have been looking through it
                and find much that I had not seen anywhere before. I see you have put in your letter
                about the Russian translation, to Lee. Did I tell
                you—(or was it in the letter that went astray?) that Lee has got an
                appointment in England which will take up all his time <sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_unmarked tei_add_place_supralinear">except in vacations,</sup> for the present at any rate? I
                haven't heard from him now for months, though I wrote twice. I know he meant to go
                into Servia and Bosnia early this year &amp; hope he hasn't got into any trouble
                there—he &amp; a friend had a rather narrow escape for there lives in those parts year before last. He is a great enthusiast for
                Panslavism, but brigands wouldn't respect that. My translation I hope to get <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01036_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01036_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01036_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>finished by
                Spring. When it approaches completion I will lecture on it in the Literarischer
                    Verein &amp; see if I cannot induce any of the
                members of it to join me in preparing it for the press, revising, etc. Or do you
                know, by correspondence or otherwise, any competent German with whom you could put
                me in communication? Not yet however; it is best, I think, that I should have it all
                turned into literal effective German, the sense of leading words penetrated, etc.
                before we go at it together. It will much facilitate the work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">To find one who will really cooperate with energy in giving a faithful presentment of
                your book will be difficult, for German literature (and art and all mental products)
                of this day is cramped by formalities and proprieties to an inconceivable
                extent—far more so than in England. Art in all branches is thought of as a
                technique—anything like strong individuality is despised—or if it
                happens to escape that fate is overtaken by a still worse one, in being lauded as if
                it were a piece of correct conventionalism like everything else. <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">—I have known this with the L of
