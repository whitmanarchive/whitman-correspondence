            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letters &amp;c have all been received and delivered to Han. Respecting her
                neglect of writing her aged mother, not the slightest apology can be offerd. I have
                been compelled for a long time to procure <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">a</span> novel, for her "Sunday" reading—and certainly, if
                she spends Sunday this way, she can't write to her mother. It is reasonable to
                anticipate, from Mrs. Whitmans past robustness, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">and</span> present approaching infirmities, that she
                will never undergo protracted sickness, but her demise, when it does take place,
                will occur in a brief period. It may so happen that Hannah may not be permitted to
                see her mother again (although I trust that Mrs Whitman will live many

                years to come.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have reasoned with Han, in this way, but without avail—Han realy
                experiences no outward sentiment or
                sympathy—This neglect <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">of</span> hers is odious to me. I have told her frankly that it is
                impossible for me to respect her, in view <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">of</span> this; coupled with her indifference, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">and</span> ingratitude in other
                cases.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">She drudges about the same—<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">"washing"</span> now takes place three days of the week, commencing
                Sunday morning; and her appearance would disgrace any servant in the vicinity. It
                seems impossible for me to maintain any respectable degree of order—It
                has become more than constant controversy—allmost a fight. She has no respect for me, nor the least consideration for the
                    <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_about tei_gap_extent_two tei_gap_extent_letters tei_gap_quantity_2 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span> bear I have performed, in endeavoring
                    <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">to</span> accomplish an
                agreeable neat, and pretty home—I can go no further with it—We
                occupy but three rooms <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">of</span> the house, and these are badly kept.

                ; my personal washing amounts to just 4
                pieces a week, with a pair of stocking and two or three handkerchiefs.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have three vacant rooms—I dare not let them, at a handsome rent, or
            either use them myself professionally—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">A greater want of morals or womanly sensibility could scarcely be found and intellectual
            imbecility—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">She has been some days, and succeeds in tracing 3 lines to her
                mother, in "lead" pencil—I grow indignant and exasperated—No man
                assumes so much household responsibilities as I do, and all but for two
                persons—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Han speaks of visiting Brooklyn. I make no objection, although it will bring no
                comfort to her mother, I <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_el">predict.</span></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">She is too thoroughly selfish—There has been a
                proposition also for my absence—a few short months, <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_quantity_4 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span> run down my place more than <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">I</span> would like to recover—So I
                shall rent the house—It is but a shelter since, I was sick; she deliberately turned
                the key on me, and I had to stay at my room all night—comment is
                unnecessary—</p>
