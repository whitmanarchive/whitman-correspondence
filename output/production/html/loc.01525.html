        <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">It is a beautiful quiet Sunday forenoon. I am feeling first rate, &amp; have had quite a
        good day so far. After breakfast I went out &amp; sat a long while on the porch in front,
        reading the Sunday paper, enjoying the cool &amp; shade—&amp; besides some real sweet
        music—A young widow next door, a friend of mother's, has been in her parlor the last
        three hours, singing and practising—she has a voice not powerful &amp; ornamental as
        the opera ladies, but with that something, pleasing &amp; tender, that goes to the right
        spot—sings good old hymns &amp; songs—I have enjoyed it greatly—you would
        too—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is now between ½ past 10 &amp; 11—The distant bells are slowly
        ringing—Otherwise it is pretty quiet—The last two hours I have been up here
        reading my proof. I have four or five hours of this every day, which gives me something to
        do—an employment like. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pete, I have just taken out your last letter, &amp; read it over again—I went out on
        a kind of little excursion by myself last night—all alone—It was very pleasant,
        cool enough, &amp; the moon shining—I think of you too, Pete, &amp; a great deal of
        the time—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Tuesday afternoon 9th </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was out yesterday a great part of the day on the river to see the yacht race—over a thousand spectator boats, big, little, &amp; middle
        sized—many of them all drest with flags, bright colored streamers &amp;c. streaming over the green waters,
        beneath the sunshine &amp; bright blue sky—a grand sight—&amp; the beautiful
        yachts &amp; pleasure boats, lots &amp; lots of them, with immense white sails, like great
        wings, tearing along in the breeze—the bay each side alive with people on the
        boats—150,000 people they say—the shores &amp; hills covered for miles
        too—I was out again last night. It was fine—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your welcome letter of the 8th has come this morning, dear loving son, &amp; has pleased
        me, as always. That accident on the bridge was indeed terrible—that bridge is a disgrace to Washington, any how—Pete, I wish you to tell Mr.
        &amp; Mrs. Nash &amp; your cousin, &amp; all, I send them my
        best respects—Also Henry Hurt—also Andy Woolridge on 7th st—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Wednesday afternoon <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>10th—</p>
      <p class="tei_p">Dear son, yours of 9th came this forenoon—I feel quite unhappy about your bad luck
        again—reported by some damned fool, &amp; taken off by a worse damned fool—But
        you keep a good heart, Pete—school will keep some how—I have no room to write
        more at present—Dear loving son, I want to keep writing frequently. </p>

      <span class="tei_closer">

        <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">just going out</span>—Bub, just in the nick of time before I sealed
          this letter, as I had finished dressing to go out, mother sung out to me from the foot of
          the stairs—&amp; I got your good welcome third letter. Pete, you are doing
          first-rate. I guess Pleasants was after something stronger
          than Kissengen—Tell Dr. Milburn I dont find any place in N. Y. or Brooklyn to compare with his, for the mineral
          drinks—But I am living more to suit me in the grub line, this weather—not so
          much meat—mother's cookery, &amp; quite a good deal of fruit &amp;c.—A lovely broil'd steak &amp; perfect coffee this morning—I wish you had been on hand, young
          man—</p>
