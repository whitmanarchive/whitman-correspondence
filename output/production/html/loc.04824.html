            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Johnston sent me a postal he had received from you dated
                Nov 22<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nd</span> from which I am sorry to learn that you were "in depressed
                condition." But I trust that you are now better.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have not much to write about at present as I have been at home 10 days—confined
                to the house 7 or 8 days—with

                 a cold. It has not been serious at all, or very severe, but it has been persistent
                &amp; bad to shake off.—I got cold on my voyage home, &amp; in the outdoor work I took
                up soon after my return I got additional cold. However, it is passing away</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One result is that I have not been to Bolton lately &amp; have not seen the friends.—But 
                I expect to do so before long.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Despite my cold, I am confident that my trip has done me good, &amp;

                that when I get clear of it, &amp; fairly acclimatised &amp; settled down again I shall feel
                marked benefit.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The weather has been better than when I last wrote, though dark &amp; dull as befits the season
                here—But yesterday afternoon was extremely beautiful—clear &amp; fine, with loveliest clouds
                &amp; atmospheric effects. I took a short walk in the country here &amp; enjoyed it very much. I had partly
                expected Dr. Johnston over, &amp; was only sorry that he could not enjoy it with me.</p>

                almost impossible to get out here. However I hope to see him soon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had quite an idle time, while unwell at home, I have been reading Shakespeare a good deal,
                with renewed pleasure &amp; delight. He has been my main company.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think of you continually. None of your photos seem to me quite satisfactory, but each recalls you
                in some degree to memory, &amp; there are times when I seem to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">see</span> your
                face &amp; hear your voice.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you give my love to Warry &amp; to M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Davis? 
                With dearest love &amp; best wishes to yourself always</p>

                <p class="tei_p">PS Curious to me, now, how I cannot read your prose writings without seeming
                    to hear your voice &amp; see your face—so identical are they with your actual speech—</p>
