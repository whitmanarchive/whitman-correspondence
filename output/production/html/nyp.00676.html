                essentially taking back their old insults &amp; charges) in wh' y'r name &amp; Dr
                B[ucke]'s are flung about—will
                probably send it to you to-morrow—(Horace T has taken it
                away temporarily)—Nothing new with me—if anything different it is I am
                feeling easier—a dark half raining warmish day here—with me sitting the
                same alone in big chair—sleep &amp; eat fairly yet—Best love—</p>
