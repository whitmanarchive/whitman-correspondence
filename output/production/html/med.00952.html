            <p class="tei_p">Whatever may be said of the "horrible state of society"
                in Paris, it certainly affords glorious times for newspaper editors and
                correspondents. How beautiful! every week some plot or counter-plot—some
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">èmeute</span>—some danger to Government and public safety. Why, they will soon turn
                up their noses in Paris, at a disturbance that involves the destruction of less than
                a thousand or two lives!—"Blessed is that people," says some very big
                philosopher whose name I forget, "who have no annals to write"—meaning, I
                suppose, that nothing bad, at least, can be said about said people. But that's
                questionable philosophy. Human nature looks best when developed by struggles, and
                changes of circumstances. Lethargy and stagnation, you know, are not only connected
                together, but are the most uninteresting qualities in the world.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Our good city of New York, now-a-time, is blessed with hardly
                any annals to write. Editors, it is true, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">are</span> writing, every day; and the people read what
                they write. But the latter is merely created, for the most part, "to fill up." 
                (Alas, that some process equally handy could'nt be hit upon to produce the same effect 
                on the poorer children of Old Ireland!) The situation of New York precludes her daily journals
                from making an important ingredient of that melange of miscellaneous news, which is so desirable to
                the papers of other places. We have to eke out something original; something that
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">looks</span> fresh, at any rate—even though it is like a new quilt made of old
                materials. Readers' appetites here will no more be satisfied with any thing less
                than dishes on a great scale, and of the latest style of dressing. Yet there is a
                wondrous amount of superficiality in the daily disquisitions spread before that
                hydra-headed creature "the public," by the daily and weekly gazettes. "Flat, stale,
                and unprofitable," are, indeed, more than half the "leaders" (particularly during
                summer) of the Northern newspapers. I will say nothing of the Southern ones, because
                you have them among you to speak for themselves.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">​ </span></span>It is now a settled and
                irrevocable <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fact</span> that the democrats of New York," yclept Barnburners,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> have broken
                away utterly and altogether from "the party," as organized in the Baltimore
                Convention,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">2</a> and developed in the nominations of 
                Cass<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> and Butler.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> 
                Martin Van Buren,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">5</a>
                from his farm at Kinderhook, looks out upon the troubled waves, but evinces no
                inclination to say, "Peace, be still." It is understood that he was violently
                opposed to accepting the nomination of the Convention at Utica; but things took such
                an enthusiastic turn there, and his oldest and truest friends had so committed
                themselves, and his name, that he will now, it is said, allow matters to take their
                own course. The Radicals here, confidently expect, in his name, to carry the State
                of New York.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">John Van Buren,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a> as soon as the nomination was made, wrapped himself up
                in lavender, and laid his political body on the shelf—swearing with an oath of
                the old sort, that he would spout no more during this campaign. John will keep good,
                though, for future use; and that, before many seasons, he must be "brought out," is
                as certain as that the morning star will rise. All the young fellows of the North,
                cotton to John; there is such a buoyancy, frankness, and such a charming <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">abandon</span>, in
                his sayings and doings. Shrewd judges of mankind say that Master John has the making
                of a better man, than the man who made him. In the way of amusements, New York is
                yet unflagging. Hamblin<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a> has taken the Park Theatre, which he will carry on in
                conjunction with the Bowery. Heaven send him success; for the "old man's" stout
                heart deserves it. Burton's Theatre, (Palmo's old place in Chambers street,) has had
                the Viennoise dancing children. At the Astor Place Opera House, have been performed
                during the summer, comedies and vaudevilles—to-morrow night, they present some
                music, with a Mons. and Madame Laborde,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">8</a> from Paris. The Monplaisiers<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">9</a> are at the
                Broadway—and "the "B'hoys" at the Chatham. Besides all these, we have Castle
                Garden, Museums, Concerts, Shows, etc., without end.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Our streets and public places present, at intervals, something connected with the "late war," 
                as it must now be called—something in the way of a soldier or officer in his yet worn uniform,
                or a mutilated relic of what <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">was</span> a stalwart man, but whom disease, or bullet or
                bayonet, has shorn of his fair proportions. Will it not be a little curious to see
                what effect, over and athwart the land, the bringing home whence they started, and
                rediffusing among us, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">real army</span>, will have on the affairs of the Republic? You
                remember, through the war, the anti-fighting folks predicted all sorts of dangers,
                when peace should make it necessary to disband our army. It is difficult, though, to
                perceive any likelihood of such dangers in any circumstances at present existing.</p>

                    opposing sides of the fracturing Democratic party in New York during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
                    reflected the national divisions that would lead to the American Civil War (1861–1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00952_n5 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00952_n5"><span>Whitman is referring to the 1848 Democratic National Convention, which

                Party's candidates for President and Vice President in the 1848 election. The nominees were Lewis
                Cass (1782–1866) for President and William O.

                    and as Secretary of State under James Buchanan. In 1848 he was the Democratic candidate for president. Cass was a 
                    proponent of the Doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, which held that each territory should choose whether to 
                    permit slavery. Cass was also crucial in the implementation of Andrew Jackson's policy of Indian Removal. For

                In 1848, Butler was the Vice Presidential nominee for the Democratic party. He and Presidential nominee Lewis

                and ballet events, but primarily produced melodramas, romances, farces, and circus acts that appealed to the working class Bowery B'hoy audiences
                of the Bowery district. In 1848, Hamblin bought the lease to the Park Theatre, which he renovated and reopened; however, the theatre was destroyed by fire
