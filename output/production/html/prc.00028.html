        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Tennyson,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">After a long absence in the mountains &amp; lakes of Vermont &amp; northern New York, I am 
        now back again at work, &amp; expect to remain here. Your letter of May 23d, also the 
        one with the picture, safely reached me. The picture is superb, &amp; I consider myself 
        in luck, possessing it. It brings you very near me. I have it now before me.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I send you, by same mail with this, in a little book, my piece lately delivered for 
        Dartmouth College commencement, up north. Did <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span> reach you?
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">We have had, in this country, a summer more fit for the infernal regions—but now the 
        delicious Virginia September has set in, balmy cool, &amp; one dilates &amp; feels like work again.
      </p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">With best respects &amp; love,</span>
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman</span>
      </span>
      
      
        <p class="tei_p">My address continues the same, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solicitor's Office Treasury, Washington, D.C.</span>
