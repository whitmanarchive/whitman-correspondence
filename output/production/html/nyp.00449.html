                    New York Cavalry, was confined in Ward C of Armory Square with a gunshot wound
                    in his left leg; see "Notebook: Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection) and "Hospital Notes" (Henry E. Huntington Library). He
                    recovered slowly from his injury. About the end of May in the following year he
                    was sent to Mower Hospital, Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, where he remained until
                    he was granted a furlough in August 1864. He later returned to Mower Hospital
                    and wrote to Whitman on <a href="nyp.00172">September 27, 1864</a>, that
                    his wound was "most healed up," and that he expected either to be discharged or
                    to be transferred to New York. See also Stilwell's letter to Whitman from <a href="nyp.00168">September 2, 1864</a>. He was the brother of Julia and
                    John Stilwell. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
