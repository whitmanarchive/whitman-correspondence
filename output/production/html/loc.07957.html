                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days with the poet, Wallace
                    traveled with the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke to Bucke's home in
                    London, Ontario, Canada, where he met Bucke's family and friends. Wallace

                    and was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization whose socialist
                    politics and working-class ideals were often informed by Whitman's work. A
                    painter and scholar of Shakespeare, he was also a lively debater. With James W.
