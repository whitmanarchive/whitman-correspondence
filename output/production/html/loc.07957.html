            <p class="tei_p">Have just had my supper—mutton chop, potato, &amp; some stew'd 
                pears—&amp; there are ten minutes light enough to write a bit, 
                &amp; finish &amp; send it off to-morrow—You will see that Dr Bucke
                is well &amp; strong &amp; hard at hard work—his estimate of J W W[allace]
                is one we all confirm, &amp; we all felt sorry to let him 
                go—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">weather</span> is finer than 
                ever—probably Indian summer 
                though without the slight haze belonging—it w'd have been 
                a splendid experience for W to have staid another week if only to 
                get a knowledge of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that</span>—Y'r kind letter yest'd'y—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1891-11-10">Nov: 10</span>—Sitting here again—just eaten my breakfast, 
                buckwheat cakes &amp; coffee—quite a budget of letters &amp;c: 
                by mail this mn'g—some ridiculous enough—have a g't pressure for 
                autographs (never answer them)—I kill two birds with one stone 
                by sending letters f'm Dr B to me—he is in his prime, 
                must feel so, writes three or four times a week always cheery—ah there 
                comes the sun shining out f'm the warm cloudy weather—Aff: regards to you &amp; J W W &amp; 
                Wild &amp; all the dear friends—
