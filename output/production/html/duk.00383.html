                        fragment can only be conjectural. In 1866, George was in business with
                        Smith. According to his mother's letter of June 7, 1866, to Walt Whitman,
                        "George and smith and french the mason has bought 5 lots on portland ave
                        opposite the arsenal, 950 a lot, going to put up brick houses" (Trent

                        will buy smiths half of that lot he will fix the shop (the carpenters shop
                        acrost the street) for me . . . for about 1200 twelv hundred dollars" (Trent
