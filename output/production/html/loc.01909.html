                sovereign commander of opinions. At present its lustre blackens and darkens. From
                democratic and liberal it has grown conservative and anxious. As all what is calling
                itself "intellect" in <span class="tei_name">Denmark</span> the editor does not at all understand the
                democratic movement among the peasantry. Your book has been as a clenched fist in
                the eyes of all these people. Of course the criticism testifies the fact. But the

                great honour. The author of the criticism Rosenberg<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">5</a> is a silly little fellow, who

                as now I hear.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">In <span class="tei_name">Berlin</span> I saw Bismarck.<a href="#n0087" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0087">11</a> It is worth the travel to

                himself "God's scourge", Napoleon<a href="#n0431" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0431">13</a> did not call himself so, but
                he was it. But Attila was imposing in the splendour of his barbaric greatness; of
                Napoleon the German H. Heine<a href="#n0297" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0297">14</a> has said "every inch a God". A
                scourge like this Brandenburgian fox hunter mankind never has known. Perhaps mankind
                never has been so deeply fallen!</p>   

            <p class="tei_p">I fully understand your interest for Björnson.<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">15</a> He is genuine,

                proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the greatest lack of the
                present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack of Bjornson at the
                same time! Bjornson owes <span class="tei_name">Denmark</span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gratitude</span>. He has shown it in the form of deep and bloody

                dollars–gaining, handshakings and other humbug.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You know too little of our relations, therefore I can tell you no more. But you will
                understand that I can forward no demand from you to Bjornson. But <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_person">Clemens Petersen</span> was one of his "lovers" and is it still.
                If Bjornson goes to <span class="tei_name">America</span>, he will visit Petersen. To <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span> you can write and get said information.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have asked you at least two times how you did like <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_person">Clemens

                    homosexuality; accusations that Petersen was inappropriately involved with schoolchildren 
                    were never proven. Petersen remained in the U.S. until 1904, when he returned to
                    Denmark. Petersen and Norwegian poet Björnstjerne Björnson
                    (1832–1910) engaged in a long correspondence, suggesting a
                    close friendship. Rudolf Schmidt pressed Walt
                    Whitman for his opinion of Petersen, as in his <a href="loc.01909">February

                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
