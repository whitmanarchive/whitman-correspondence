            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Returning from <span class="tei_name">Germany</span> I found your letter of 25 Jan. waiting for me with many others. My first task is to
                write to you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">'Democratic Vistas' has appeared in Danish translation
                for two weeks ago. I sent you myself one copy in loose sheets (<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">to​ </span><span class="tei_corr">two​
        
      </span></span> of those small parcels) and the editor has during my absence on the day of
                the appearance sent you two complete copies—one of them <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">unpaid</span>, that it could be sure to reach you. In "Illustreret <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aja">Foereblal</span>"
                (the people's illustrated
                magazine) for 22 Feb your likeness with a short biographical notice has been
                published, and the editor has sent you some copies. Of course all these parcels have
                gone to the Solicitor's office in
                    <span class="tei_name">Washington</span>. I hope, that nevertheless the most of them have reached
                you. If not, let me know it as soon as possible, and new copies shall then be
                forwarded.</p>   

            <p class="tei_p">"Fædrelandet" (the fatherland) brings this evening a criticism
                on eight columns on your book. You shall have the paper sent one of these days.
                "Fædrelandet" was during 30 years our <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01909.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01909.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01909.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> most influential paper, the
                sovereign commander of opinions. At present its lustre blackens and darkens. From
                democratic and liberal it has grown conservative and anxious. As all what is calling
                itself "intellect" in <span class="tei_name">Denmark</span> the editor does not at all understand the
                democratic movement among the peasantry. Your book has been as a clenched fist in
                the eyes of all these people. Of course the criticism testifies the fact. But the
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">eight</span> columns are in the eyes of the Danish public a
                great honour. The author of the criticism Rosenberg is a silly little fellow, who
                understands nothing between heaven and earth, and least of all, you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_name tei_name_type_person">Clemens Petersen</span> was in ten years the
                critic of "Fædrelandet." It has been told to me, that his essay in "the Atlantic
                monthly" has had a great "success" in America. I can hardly believe it. Is it true?
                It should interest me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very much</span> to have true information
                on this point. My own opinion I wrote you in a letter
                the last summer. I hope, that you have received it. I also one time sent you a
                choice of Norwegian and Swedish poems in English translation, 
                have you received it?
                With poor Clausen I sent you my picture. If you have not got,
                then <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aja">ask</span> it from his

      </span></span> received. But I did
                not think, that your illness had been so very severe,
                as now I hear.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">In <span class="tei_name">Berlin</span> I saw Bismarck. It is worth the travel to
                get a glance on this so very <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">powerfull​ </span><span class="tei_corr">powerful​
        
      </span></span> and so excessively beastly face. Attila called
                himself "God's scourge", Napoleon did not call himself so, but
                he was it. But Attila was imposing in the splendour of his barbaric greatness; of
                Napoleon the German H. Heine has said "every inch a God". A
                scourge like this Brandenburgian fox hunter mankind never has known. Perhaps mankind
                never has been so deeply fallen!</p>   

            <p class="tei_p">I fully understand your interest for Björnson. He is genuine,
                his poetry comes from the source that is throbbing in the people's own <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">heat​ </span><span class="tei_corr">heart​
        
      </span></span>. He has been the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public. But he is a
                living test of the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">hidous​ </span><span class="tei_corr">hideous​
        
      </span></span> and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly head among the flowers of the
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pantheistic</span> poetry. You have in your "vistas" spoken
                proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the greatest lack of the
                present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack of Bjornson at the
                same time! Bjornson owes <span class="tei_name">Denmark</span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gratitude</span>. He has shown it in the form of deep and bloody

                that make every honest Danish <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">heat​ </span><span class="tei_corr">heart​
        
      </span></span> burn with rage and indignation. I hope never to see this man, whom I have
                really loved, more. At present he is in <span class="tei_name">Italy</span> and most probably he is
                going to <span class="tei_name">America</span> in the spring to finish his moral putrification with
                dollars–gaining, handshakings and other humbug.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You know too little of our relations, therefore I can tell you no more. But you will
                understand that I can forward no demand from you to Bjornson. But <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_person">Clemens Petersen</span> was one of his "lovers" and is it still.
                If Bjornson goes to <span class="tei_name">America</span>, he will visit Petersen. To <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span> you can write and get said information.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have asked you at least two times how you did like <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_person">Clemens
                    Petersen</span>; you have not replied and most probably you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">wont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">won't​
        
      </span></span> speak of this matter. If that is the case, I shall repeat the question no
                more.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Hoping that these lines will find you in ameliorated state of health I am</p>
