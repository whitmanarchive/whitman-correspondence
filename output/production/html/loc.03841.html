            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to hear by your postal that you are getting along without an increase of
                suffering. I wish that we all were near you, if so be that we might make an
                occasional hour brighter for you &amp; contribute to your exterior comforts. I see no
                time to be fixed for our return. Alys proposes to go to
                Bryn Mawr College in September &amp; then will visit you. She will return to us if all
                is well in June 1890 with her diploma in her pocket.</p>

                Florence, Venice, Milan, Switzerland &amp; home escaping thus
                the melancholy skies of London with its "pea soup" smoky
                atmosphere.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Logan is doing well at his college at Oxford &amp; is
                studying faithfully in his vacation at home.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mary's second daughter, 3 weeks old, opens new hopes &amp;
                joys—but through much suffering. Her husband is in the
                new London City Council and is becoming prominent in abilities &amp; in his profession
                as a barrister.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">So I have not much to tell. Yet it is fun to be in the midst of this great fermenting
