                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p"> More than a month back I addressed a letter to you, which misfortune of one kind or
                another may have overtaken, or which you may not yet have had time or inclination to
                    answer. It was referring to the scheme of a new
                edition of your Poems in England here, but I'm afraid was not clear enough as to the
                rights &amp; reasons of such an edition, or the way it would be carried out. In the
                letter I explained something of <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> this, but not enough; and it was careless of me to do this &amp;
                then expect you to reply to an insufficient proposal, when you must have already
                more to do in this way than can be easily compassed. For fear too that the letter
                never reached you at all, it will be better to state the whole matter afresh. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> A series of poets was last year begun by Walter Scott the
                publisher under the occasional editorship of my friend, Joseph Skipsey, poet &amp;
                former coal-miner; (I have been a coal-miner—a
                mining engineer that is—myself; hence the connection!) and in their list a
                month or two after my arrival in London as a student of life &amp; letters this
                year, I saw rather to my astonishment your name <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> amid the rest, &amp; feeling that
                in some ways I had a special right &amp; knowledge I ventured to write in, offering to
                prepare the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume.​ ">vol.</span>​  Skipsey's influence did the rest. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> At first it seemed rather out of place to have your work in a series of this kind
                called, rather stupidly, "The Canterbury Poets," and got up in a cheap &amp;
                prettified fashion, with red lines, &amp;c. But afterwards it struck me that there
                might be gain in the end through it. Now I have succeeded in one hope: the
                publishers will give up the red lines &amp; trivial design of cover. Next will be to
                have your Poems issued in a different shape—quite square I should like to have
                it—so as to give your long lines full play! And the very <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> including of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> in a series like this gives them a chance of reaching people who
                would otherwise never see them. What I—&amp; many
                young men like me, ardent believers in your poetic initiative—chiefly feel
                about this is however, that an edition at a price which will put it in the reach of
                the poorest member of the great social democracy is a thing of imperative
                requirement. You know what a fervid stir &amp; impulse forward of Humanity there is
                to-day in certain quarters, and I am sure you will be tremendously glad to help us
                here, in the very camp of the enemy, the stronghold of caste &amp; aristocracy &amp;
                all selfishness between rich &amp; poor! </p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p"> Some people want to claim you as the property of a certain literary clique,—a
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rara avis</span>, to be carefully kept out of sight of the
                uneducated mob as not able to understand &amp; appreciate the peculiar qualities of
                your work. This does harm in many ways, &amp; it would be a very good thing to make
                a fair trial of the despised mob. The price of Wilson &amp; McCormick's edition —half-a-guinea—practically damns the popular
                circulation of the book, &amp; gives colour to the notion of its being a luxury only
                for the rich. What we want then is an edition for the poor, &amp; this proposed one
                at only a shilling would be within reach of every man willing &amp; caring to read. </p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p"> I did not know until a week or so back that Wilson &amp; McCormick had any direct
                authorisation for their Ed<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">n</span>, or should certainly have
                advised Walter Scott to communicate his intention to them. Now someone has written
                on their behalf resenting—very naturally—his appearance in the field.
                But this difficulty might be easily settled by Scott paying, say ten guineas outright
                or a certain royalty per copy, to them on your account, if W. &amp; McC. would not
                like a new contract with you by Scott. The fact of the new proposed ed<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">n</span> being one of smaller scope [the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  would not hold more than ⅔<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rds</span> of the
                poetry;] would no doubt weigh with them too, reference being clearly made to the
                complete works to which this would serve as a pilot for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.007_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the time being, &amp; increase the
                sale in the end. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> As for my own share, all I really care about is to procure a serviceable popular
                edition, giving all the help an earnest &amp; enthusiastic sympathy can devise. On
                mere literary grounds I have very little claim, but I have a great love &amp; desire
                to help the struggling mass of men, to be a true soldier in "The War of liberation
                of Humanity." I should strive to just say what would best bring your Ideal to the
                hearts of such as the coal-miners &amp; shepherds of the North—dear friends of
                mine many of them, many consciously, all unconsciously—and being a young
                man myself to make Leaves of Grass potent for comradeship and chivalry &amp;
                manliness all through in the young men who are in the forefront to-day. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03311.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03311.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I feel very much
                inclined to say a great deal more about my hopes and ideals, but to-night perhaps it
                is better not. One thing though I must say a word about,—how much in noblest
                knowledge &amp; inspiration I have to thank you for, in life &amp; religion &amp;
                poetry &amp; manhood, a debt it will not suffice to pay in words at all, but which
                someday you will see, I hope, may be fairly written off the score. Meanwhile,
                receive the greeting of one more follower on this side the Atlantic,— </p>

                <p class="tei_p"> Any suggestions or directions as to the scheme &amp; scope of the book I will
                    thank you for most heartily, and will furnish fuller details as they are
                    arranged. </p>
