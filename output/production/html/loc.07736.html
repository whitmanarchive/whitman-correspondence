            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs of 1st rec'd &amp; welcomed—Much the same as of late continued with
                me—I saw the Ill: London News portrait—not satisfactory—have sent off the little "Northern Star-Group to a
                Southern" (welcome to Brazilian Republic) wh' if printed
                I will see that you get copy—rec'd a good letter f'm Ed: Wilkins—(think it very likely that veterinary business is a good
                move for Ed: in the future)—lots of bad or half-bad weather here—but I
                go out a little in the wheel-chair—was out yesterday—have just had my
                mid-day currying—The enclosed printed bit ab't Edw'd Carpenter comes f'm Chicago—(If you
                write to E C &amp; choose, you can send it to him)—the other is f'm Mrs:
                    O'C[onnor] who is back in her old quarters in Wash'n—I see you are busy enough—&amp; fulfilling
                it all—I almost envy you.</p>
