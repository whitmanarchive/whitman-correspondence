                    Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
                    late fall of 1875. On <a href="med.00453">October 19, 1875</a>, Whitman
                    wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
                    Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
                    Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Times</span>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in
                    his <a href="yal.00260">January 26, 1873</a>, letter to his mother, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office. See also his <a href="med.00418">March 21, 1873</a>, letter to his mother. </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li></ul>
