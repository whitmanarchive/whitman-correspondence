                    beginning of Whitman's extensive correspondence with William Sloane Kennedy
                    (1850–1929), who at this time was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span>, and who later published biographies of
                    Longfellow and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American
                    Biography</span>). Apparently Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on
                    November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of
                        Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander Gardner, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was
                    to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first published article he
                    admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of language" and protested
                    that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158. Yet,
                    according to John Burroughs's letter to Whitman on November 2, 1880, Kennedy was
                    angered by Edmund Clarence Stedman's article in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's
                        Monthly</span> (see the letter from Whitman to Burroughs of <a href="med.00688">November 26, 1880</a>), and thought that his own
                    article did Whitman "fuller justice" (T. E. Hanley Collection, University of
                    Texas). He vigorously defended his views in a letter to Burroughs on February
                    26, 1881 (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
                    201–204). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00757_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00757_n2"><span>Excerpts from articles
