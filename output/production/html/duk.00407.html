                such things will occur, and then it is, at my, or our age, like parting with life

                    Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor

                    She married Charles Heyde in 1852, and the couple lived in Burlington, Vermont.
                    Charles regularly disparaged his wife and her sometimes erratic behavior in his
