                how Walt is. She recieves all your cards, letters, magazines, books/Antiquary, you
                send her. She is not very well: the weather has been hot, although our house is well
                shaded with the trees I planted 20 years ago. But I cannot but feel apprehensive
                that shall be compelled to give it up: prices of paintings are so low, and no
                purchasers, at that.

                such things will occur, and then it is, at my, or our age, like parting with life
                itself: there are times, when pinched by necessity and age, we feel that life is not
                worth living for. How well you have endured your trials, (physical) without
                complaining.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Han is very nervous: taxes (25) are overdue: every year they are increased – pay
                no rent, yet taxes are something.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall be pleased to see and read your book. My Sister Mrs Coll sends me a little
                money at times, which buys a load of wood and some groceries. Han says she is a
