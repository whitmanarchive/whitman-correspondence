                Your own criticism of "Good-Bye"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> is good—will probably be the best—its general "old age"

                it implies and gives something else just as good as these: undying courage, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">vim</span>, and faith to the last in the

                facts and faith of your life. Have you a copy of Kennedy's<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">4</a> criticism to share?<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
