            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> A happy New Year to you, &amp; many returns of the same. I was right glad to get your
                letter &amp; to know your eyes were so much better. I feel certain that if you eat
                little or no meat you will be greatly the gainer. It will not do to take
                in sail in ones activities &amp;c, unless he takes in sail in his food also.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> We are all pretty well here <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01153.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01153.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01153.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> this winter so far. I have just sent off the copy for my new <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol</span>​ : think I shall stick to "Signs &amp; Seasons" for the title, as this
                covers all the articles. Kennedy
                sent me his essay on the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Poet as Craftsman</span>. I liked it
                pretty well: what he has to say about you is excellent. He wanted my opinion about
                the argument of the essay, so I told him that I never felt like quarreling with a
                real poet about his form: let him take the form he can use best; any form is good if
                it holds good poetry <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01153.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01153.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01153.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> &amp; any form is bad that holds bad poetry. I would not have
                    Tennyson, or Longfellow or Burns use other forms than they do. If a man excells in prose
                he is pretty sure to use prose. Coleridge is greater in prose than in poetry. Poe is
                greater in poetry than in prose. Carlyle tried the poetic form
                &amp; gave it up. </p>  
            <p class="tei_p"> I hope you will keep well &amp; that I will see you again before long. How much I
                wish you were here to eat a New Years dinner <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01153.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01153.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01153.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> with us. I wrote to Herbert
                Gilchrist the other day. These must be dark days for he &amp;
                    Grace. To me a black shadow seems to have settled on all
                England since I read of the death of Mrs Gilchrist. I
                wish you would send me by mail or by Express those books of Emerson, the essays &amp; the miscellanies. I want to use them. I
                am going to re-read Emerson, &amp; see how he strikes me now. </p>
