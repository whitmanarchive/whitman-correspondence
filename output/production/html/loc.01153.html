                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
                    Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nature</span>.
                    Having read Whitman's first edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>,
                    Emerson wrote a letter to Whitman, famously pronouncing him to be "at the
                    beginning of a great career." In his response, Whitman eagerly addressed the
                    Concord philosopher as "Master." Whitman published both Emerson's letter and his
                    response in the second edition of <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1856/poems/33"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span></a>.  </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
