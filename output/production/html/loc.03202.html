            <p class="tei_p">I received the "November boughs" and like the general get up of the book much.
                It has a fresh, inviting appearance, &amp; one wonders what it contains,
                something good—sure! The most I have had time for yet is the Hicks 
                article. I think you have done good

                work for the long neglected. It is genial, inspiring, picture-like. If the
               old broad brims of Richmond were not so close fisted, I should predict that
               they would buy copies of the book by the score, but my experience with them
               was that they wilted when the cost of things that enthused them stepped, 
               however modestly, to the front. 
               Blake is very much pleased to get the book, &amp; will I expect give it a good
               description in their <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Unity</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hear by Horace that you are moderately comfortable &amp; holding
            on to your life interests. Do you know that is about the summing up 
            for us all—moderately, so, so.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am doing fairly well—am getting where I pay expenses now, with my entertainments.
               A wealthy lady of culture by chance came to one of my evenings at

                my Carlyle &amp; Emerson, &amp; engaged
                me for two parlor <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">entertainments</span> at her own home. The
                first I gave last week Thursday to a company of some 30 young ladies—very
                bright they were, and responsive. It was the most successful so far of all I have done.
                To-morrow afternoon I give to the girls <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">parents</span>. 
                They are reputed to have culture &amp; money, &amp; to be "very swell."

                If they receive me as pleasantly as the young folk did, I shall
                at least, enjoy the occasion myself. The young ladies, ranging from 18 to 25 perhaps,
               were all alert, sympathetic, eager, enthusiastic. I drew with 
               chalk &amp; worked the clay—modeling rough 
               a head of Cleveland, &amp; then, changing it
                to Harrison—a work not exceeding five minutes. They happened to be all
                republicans, so I finished on the top wave of great applause. Then
                they gathered around &amp; took a poke at the clay themselves— told me

      </span></span> College, near Boston. I was engaged for
                an hour, but 3 hours passed before the company broke up, with lunch &amp;
                souvenirs of little clay heads.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">This introduction promises to expand into a winter's work very pleasing
                and <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">financialy</span> satisfying, as well. 
                To-morrow I am to take all the art-work
                I have here, &amp; the lady is to procure other things so we can turn her
                back parlor into a studio on wh. she can open her <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">folding</span> 
                doors at the appointed hour.
                It is suggested that I call these entertainments <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Morse's Studios</span>—so
                people will say, "Go to, now: let us have one of Morse's Studios in our parlors. It is quite the
                thing." Ahem! Let the lady that presides over your house read this &amp; 
                say how it sounds.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">We are having charming weather just now. The Election interest warms up &amp; the 
                din is to be heard every evening. It looks to me as though Harrison has made a steady gain
                over the country, while Cleveland has been guilty of much clap-trap. Undoubtedly 
                the situation in N.Y. has grown desperate. Some of Harrison's little speeches I have
                noticed have been excellent in form &amp; sentiment. He has certainly grown himself &amp;
                in public estimtation. At first it looked as though Blaine would eclipse 
                <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">the Harrison</span>
                but quietly he has come to the front, &amp; Blaine has fallen back.
                B's reception here was hearty, but when H's name was mentioned the audience
                rose to their feet.</p>
