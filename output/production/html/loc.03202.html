               were all alert, sympathetic, eager, enthusiastic. I drew with

                din is to be heard every evening. It looks to me as though Harrison has made a steady gain
                over the country, while Cleveland has been guilty of much clap-trap. Undoubtedly 
                the situation in N.Y. has grown desperate. Some of Harrison's little speeches I have
                noticed have been excellent in form &amp; sentiment. He has certainly grown himself &amp;
                in public estimtation. At first it looked as though Blaine<a href="#n4268" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4268">14</a> would eclipse

                but quietly he has come to the front, &amp; Blaine has fallen back.
                B's reception here was hearty, but when H's name was mentioned the audience

                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
