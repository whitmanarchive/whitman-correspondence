                    rec'd—gloomy prospect enough—Nothing new
                with me—have just had my breakfast, mutton broth with plenty of rice, &amp;
                cup of chocolate—(ate &amp; drank all)—Sent you several slip abstracts
                of the Sarrazin article—Harned paid Ed [Wilkins] up yesterday—he is well—Cold
                &amp; half cloudy weather—I am sitting by the stove—thinking a good deal
                ab't O'C—</p>
