            <p class="tei_p">What I fear is, you will have to deprive yourself of some needed comfort, and that
                worries me. Your kindness does me good, but Walt dear your health and your not

                so you see Walt dear you need not feel in the least anxious I meant to have written,
                but supposed you thought me well, (I did not know 
                    Charlie had written until your letter came) I
                was waiting to say I was well. I mean to write dear brother before long and tell you

            <p class="tei_p">Walt dear about the money you have sent me I feel a little uneasy about your sparing
                so much. I felt bad
                yesterday. I feel afraid Charlie has been writing one of his conplaining letters. (I
                may be mistaken) I have asked him what he wrote, he gets angry, says its all right,
                must leave it to him, but Walt you must <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never</span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never</span> again send me money unless you have much more than
                you can use for your own needs. I have some money yet that you sent me that I had
                saved if needed I have used since I have been sick. I am grateful to Charlie for all
                he has done for me since I have been sick, but I wish he was different that he would
                tell me when he writes to you, I knew he wrote to you yesterday,—not what he wrote.
                he has gone out to take a long walk this afternoon. I am alone, my being sick has
                been bad for him I know</p>
