                so much. I felt bad
                yesterday. I feel afraid Charlie has been writing one of his conplaining letters. (I
                may be mistaken) I have asked him what he wrote, he gets angry, says its all right,
                must leave it to him, but Walt you must <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never</span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never</span> again send me money unless you have much more than
                you can use for your own needs. I have some money yet that you sent me that I had
                saved if needed I have used since I have been sick. I am grateful to Charlie for all
                he has done for me since I have been sick, but I wish he was different that he would
                tell me when he writes to you, I knew he wrote to you yesterday,—not what he wrote.
                he has gone out to take a long walk this afternoon. I am alone, my being sick has
                been bad for him I know</p>
