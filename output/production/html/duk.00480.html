            you are having time to take some recreations
            and very glad to have the dollar you
            will say a dollar aint much but
            sometimes it is worth more than 2 or 3 at
            another time george has had more
            than usual to pay this month in sessments
                and insurance but i have had quite
            considerable from him so i wanted
            a letter to day and it come from
            the good old stand by) Jeffy
                worried
            quite much because he couldent leave
            me something in the way of a present but
            he said he had to pay so much more
            away than he expected that he was
            rather short but he would send me
                some when he got back
                i told him
                i got along very well to not worry
            about that he went away tuesday
