                    dated the letter only to a Saturday. The date assigned by Richard Maurice Bucke,
                    April 27, 1867, is defensible. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date
                    (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 1:378).The letter's contents seem to match the
                    period between Thomas Jefferson Whitman's offer of employment at the St. Louis
                    Water Works and his departure for the position. And if so, this letter
                    corresponds also to the appearance of Eugene Benton's appraisal of Walt Whitman
                    in the April 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>. However, a review to which
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman refers from the previous "thursday times," which would
                    be April 25, 1867 if the date is correct, raises significant doubts with regard
                    to the date of this letter. Louisa reports that she encloses a clipping from the
                    "thursday times" in which Whitman is labeled the "only american poet." If she
                    has misnamed the newspaper, she may refer to Ferdinand Freiligrath's "Walt
                    Whitman" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Commonwealth</span>, July 4, 1868) or possibly
                    to an unknown article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Saturday Review</span> that
                    Horace Traubel dates September 21, 1867. Either article, if enclosed, would
                    change the date of this letter. If the sentiment is more general and not a
                    direct quotation, the most likely newspaper for the enclosed clipping is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</span> or the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                        Times</span>. If a later date is proposed, it should correspond to a recent
                    visit to Brooklyn by Thomas Jefferson Whitman. Another factor is George
                    Washington Whitman's work for Moses Lane on the "new mane that was laid last
                    fall." George is also said to be working on the "new main" in Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's <a href="duk.00502">June 20, 1867</a> and <a href="duk.00518">March 6, 1868</a> letters to Walt. If Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's phrase "only american poet" is a quote from an article, this letter's
                    date is incorrect. If her phrase is not a quotation, April 27, 1867, or any
                    Saturday in April is a reasonable date for this letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    1867, Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's travel and shortness of funds are

                    engineer of the St. Louis Water Works. He began work in St. Louis on May 7,
                    1867. Though a letter from Jeff Whitman to Walt Whitman informing him of the

                    lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the

                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
                    poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the

                    (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864.
                    After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a
                    lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving
                    or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John
                    Burroughs in 1857 and also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on
