                    Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Burroughs
                    (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C. in 1864 and
                    became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also go on to
                    write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
                    was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
                    advisors and literary executors. For more on Whitman's relationship with

                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence

                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more
