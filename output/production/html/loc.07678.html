            <p class="tei_p">Pretty fair with me personally to-day—warm spell over two weeks
                but I keep up amid it (but every week or month a button or peg gives out—most 
                of the time mildly—but I realize it well enough—my sight &amp;
                hearing are quite markedly dulling)—warmth shaded a little to-day &amp;
                cloudy any how—ate a rare egg &amp; some Graham bread &amp; coffee for my
                breakfast—eat two meals a day &amp; moderate &amp; plain, but relish them—sit 
                here alone, as now, quiet &amp; middling comfortable—rather an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">un</span>fair night
                last (not common)—bladder botherations—bowel action this forenoon—I
                enclose Eldridge's rec'd to day, as you might like to know—Where &amp; ab't
                Marvin I don't know—I will send you "Donnelly's Reviewers" right
                away—I lent it to a friend &amp; have just sent for it but could not get it this
                forenoon—Mrs: O'C is yet at Wash'n, but expects to break up
                soon I think—</p>

                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
                    service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
                    very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees in prospect I
                    was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present portion—same that I held
                    before.—I hope to resume practice in the state, some time in the future, when
                    I have paid my debts and saved a little money.—I am now a citizen of
                    California and hope to always remain such. I should not be contented to settle down
                    in the East, again, I think.—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The death of William O'Connor though long anticipated, was a
                    great shock when the news came—What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
                    power was there extinguished, if it could be so: but I don't believe he or any of us
                    can go out like a child's carlacue in the night. I have faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of
                    Jordan, &amp; if we can only have such good times as we had of yore in Washington<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02028.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02028.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02028.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I shall be
                    content. My mother is still living in Boston at the age of 75, well and hearty.
                    Thank God—I have not seen her for two years, and more.</p>
