            <p class="tei_p">Mattie is about the same—she has not failed so much within the last few days—indeed I do not know but that she feels a little better—but she is weaker—yet does not suffer so much  If the weather should prove good I hope she may still gain again—yet the Dr gives no hope—if she can keep up till Walt gets well enough to come to see her I should rejoice</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter this morning dear Mother—I knew you would all feel badly—but as Mattie was failing so very rapidly I then thought she would not live even a day—I cannot say that Mattie worries much about the children—the fact is that she has been sick so long and suffered so much that I do not think she appreciates how near the end is</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If there is any change I will write immediately. Love to all</p>
