            <p class="tei_p">i have received
                your good letter to day was glad to hear
                you had A holiday wish you could have
                come to Brooklyn an let us look at you and
                see your new suit i suppose you wear
                them every day or doo you keep them
                for sunday) i thought i would write a
                few lines as i had a chance to day
                georgey
                dident come home to dinner to day as he
                had to go to the hall and get his money
                i have had two letters from jeff
                since i
                wrote to you walt the first was written 26th
                saying matty 
                was quite sick had been very
                sick
                by his statement had a very bad could
                
                and was taken with cramps in her stomach
                but the second letter announced her very
                much better he said he thought i would
                be worried and so he sent the second
                one Jeff is easiy
                excited when any thing
                is the matter with any of them but i think
                very probably Matty was quite bad the
                last letter she wrote to me she said
                she should never care to see Brooklyn
