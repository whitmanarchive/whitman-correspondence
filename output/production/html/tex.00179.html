                        only to the decade of the 1860s. Edwin Haviland Miller did not assign a date
                        in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    <p class="tei_p">Due to its continuation of the discussion on the replacement of the Brooklyn
                        postmaster, which occurred on May 12, 1868, this letter must follow Louisa

                        possible dates but are difficult to reconcile exactly. Louisa refers to a
                        letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman that she received, which dated
                        the "26th." She also wrote that Ansel Van Nostrand was "here this week as
                        the grand masonic lodge meets." According to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn
                            Daily Eagle</span>, an Odd Fellows lodge held a ceremony on May 26. Though
                        the Odd Fellows were not affiliated with the Freemasons, Louisa probably
                        referred to Ansel's lodge. Because she "look[s] for Ansel here this week,"
                        she most likely wrote on May 29 (Sunday) or the following day.</p>

                        because Mattie responded to Louisa's "account of poor Wright" from this

                        (Sunday, May 30–Saturday, June 6), Louisa must have sent this letter
