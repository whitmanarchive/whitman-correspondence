                have just returned from the country, hence a little delay in getting off this note. </p>

Herbert Gilchrist and William
                    Michael Rossetti had been collecting funds in England for the financial support
                    of Whitman. A paragraph in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span> of July
                    11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to
                    presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
                    in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
                    from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
                    himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
                    occasional contributions to magazines." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n0522">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0522 note" id="n0522"><span>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
                    Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
                    Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
                    Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man . . .
                    never satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>). Aldrich visited Whitman at his Camden home
                    numerous times, and he served as a conduit between the poet and William Michael
                    Rossetti in England, who edited the first British edition of Whitman's work. For
