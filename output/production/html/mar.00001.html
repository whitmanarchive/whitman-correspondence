            <p class="tei_p">I am puzzled considerably—Nov 12 I sent you from here the proof of "Eminent
                    Visitors"—See by the paper of 17th the errors
                I marked were not corrected—Same note I requested some proof slips of the E.
                V. article—None have reached me. Nov: 19 I wrote you (reiterating the
                above &amp;) saying as I could probably not now be furnished with proof slips I
                would like a dozen copies of the paper—No response to either of the letters—Didnt they reach you?</p>
