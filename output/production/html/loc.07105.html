               Herald called "A Lunch with Walt
               Whitman," worse than the N. Y. Herald yarn of two years ago, or so, in its 
               mischief-making potency. It consists of
               cheap tattle, with malicious and ill-natured flings at prominent men. It would be well to
               "serve an injunction" on the young man, for the publication of any of his untruthful
               gossip about you would grieve all your friends.

                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
                    in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
                    the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    (1869–1944) was the son of a German father and a Japanese mother and
                    author of books on religion, art, and poetry. On <a href="loc.07100">June
                        21, 1889</a>, Baxter informed Whitman of a "call" from "your friend
                    Hartmann, who is on his way back to Philadelphia from Europe." Hartmann
                    published in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> on April 14, 1889, "Walt
                    Whitman. Notes of a Conversation with the Good Gray Poet by a German Poet and
                    Traveller." Whitman expressed his disapproval of the article in his letter to
                    William Sloane Kennedy of <a href="duk.00920">May 4, 1889</a>. Hartmann
                    also tried to establish a Walt Whitman Society in Boston. Whitman would later
                    credit Kennedy and Sylvester Baxter with putting an end to Hartmann's Whitman
