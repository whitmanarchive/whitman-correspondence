                    counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the conclusion of the trial,
                    Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to confirm him. Failing

                    in the House of Representatives, with the Democrats losing nine. The Republicans
                    gained a clear majority in the House, holding 173 seats to the Democrats' 47.
                    With fellow border states Delaware and Maryland, Kentucky was one of only three
                    states to elect Democratic representatives; Democratic failure in the election
                    was due in no small part to the rise of Reconstruction politics and the waning
                    popularity of President Andrew Johnson, who stumped for several Democratic
