                    private in Company I of the 120th New York Infantry, was wounded at the Battle
                    of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. Whitman noted that Vandemark was placed in
                    &#x93;bed 39&#x97;Ward B&#x94; at Armory Square Hospital, and Whitman may have
                    written a letter to Vandemark's sister Sarah in Accord, New York (Edward F.
                    Grier, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span>,
                    [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 2:644). Vandemark returned home on
                    furlough and was briefly transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps during the
                    summer of 1864 before returning to his regiment. He was killed on a skirmish
                    line during the charge on Fort Davis at Petersburg, Virginia, on September 28,
                    1864. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
