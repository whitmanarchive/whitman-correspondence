                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    Kennedy's manuscript of his projected book on Whitman he recorded the following
                    which "Whitman is said to have said" to the art historian C. Sadakichi Hartmann:
                    "E. C. Stedman is after all nothing more than a sophistical dancing master. If
                    Hercules or Apollo should make their appearance, he would look at them with the
                    eye of a dancing master" (Trent Collection, Duke University). Hartmann
                    attributed the remark to Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span>
                    on April 14, 1889. It is the publication of this article, which Kennedy feels
                    misrepresents Whitman's words and opinions, that Kennedy is referring to as an
                    "outrageous act" that stands to damage the poet's reputation. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1043">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n1043 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n1043"><span>Edmund Clarence Stedman

                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
