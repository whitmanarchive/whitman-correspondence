                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt—:.</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yes; i.e. Baxter wrote me an indignant letter—enclosing clipping fr. some N. Y.
                paper—a hifalutin journalese acc't of the Japanese's outrageous act. It seems,
                then, that the set of the alleged conversations with you which he gave me was only a
                copy: I have them now somewhere. The duplicate wh. he retained he has pub.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>,—where I can't quite make out, N. Y. Herald I
                suppose you mean. We were very sorry for yr sake: the damage done is irreparable I
                suppose. You remember, I wrote &amp; warned you that the fellow tried to pub. these
                things. We were both of us—you &amp; I—too careless. I should have tho't
                that he might have a duplicate, &amp; your good nature sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> not
                have hindered you writing him peremptorily &amp; severely not to pub.—However,
                with all my deep chagrin, I c<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> but laugh (long &amp; well),
                over little Stedman &amp; Holmes (I suppose the Holmes bit came out
                too). What the frantic-for-notoriety pap. reports is true as gospel, whether you
                said it or not. How w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> it do for me to send to Stedman the
                card I rec'd fr. you anent yr alleged opinion of him à la Hartmann, (in which card you say good things of Stedman, &amp; deny that you
                hold the Hartmannian opinion) how wd it do for me to send this to Stedman? <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> was not going to mention the matter to you or to St.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03000.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03000.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03000.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> But since it has come
                out so publicly, this card w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> serve as a sort of rebuttal
                &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">amende</span> perhaps. You say in it "as to my alleged opinion
                of Stedman: I have no such opinion. My feeling toward S. is one of good will &amp;
                thanks markedly—O'C says he is a good fellow, &amp; I say so too."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But no: I w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> not dare to send this card. Stedman w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> never forgive my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">trying to comfort
                    him</span>. Ha! ha! The worst of the damnable business is that it sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> come so close on the heels of that at bottom
                warm-hearted (if conceited &amp; patronizing—slightly—) letter of S's to
                you. Hang it, hang 
                it. Damn these foreign adventurers say I.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">I think I shall now pitch overboard fr my book the Hartmannian lading (supplement)
                entirely.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have a day off to-day: am resting by varnishing, shellac-ing &amp;c
                inside—polishing the nacre of the shell.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Glad to hear that the Sarrazin book is out. Will make note thereof.</p>
