        <span class="tei_salute">My dearest friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I did not know at all till supper with my sister-in-law <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">last
          evening</span> that you had had a conversation with her about, &amp; special
        interest in, my pecuniary condition, &amp;c. If I had known it at the time I should
        have spoken about it, &amp; freely, to you, by word of mouth—as that would
        have been, &amp; is, best in such things.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When I came to Camden in '73, paralyzed, I felt, (&amp; the feeling has since been
        confirmed,) that I had retired for good from the active world, but that I might
        linger along for years yet. I bought a pleasant little cheap lot here, paid for it,
        &amp; my plan was to put up a small three or four room house on it, in which I might
        live plainly &amp; comfortably the rest of my days—&amp; that is still my plan
        &amp; desire.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I had saved up quite a fund from my
        earnings '65 to '72 as clerk in Washington—but they have now become about
        exhausted by expenses of three years, (for I just take board &amp; lodging here
        &amp; pay for them scrupulously same as in some temporary inn.) My great wish still
        is to put up for myself this little three or four room home for the rest of my days,
        independently, in a sort. I suppose it would cost 700 or 800 dollars.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have managed to get out complete my new edition both Vols. which I now begin to
        sell &amp; job myself—intend to continue doing so—(have somehow an idea
        that I should then, in my own shanty, &amp; for time to come, be able to live on the
        moderate steady income of the sales of my own works—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">which
          is most satisfactory to me</span>)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I was in hopes to have seen you again before you sail'd—I was at Mrs Lesley's
        again about three weeks since (to meet Miss Kate Hillard)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—had a very pleasant afternoon with Mrs.
        L &amp; the rest—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Things go on much the same with me in physical condition—I send you a paper
        &amp; some slips, same mail with this—I have written very lately to W M
        Rossetti about my affairs, books, &amp;c.</p>

                    by the references to the 1876 edition. Perhaps Conway visited Walt Whitman on
                    March 18, 1876. According to Whitman's <a href="nyp.00325">February 24,
                        1876</a> letter to Ellen O'Connor, Conway was to return to England about
                    the middle of March 1876. For the subsequent controversy, see Whitman's <a href="prc.00037">April 7, 1876</a> letter to William Michael
