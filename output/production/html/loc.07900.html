                    (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
                    Whitman. Wallace, along with Dr. John Johnston (1852–1927), a physician in
                    Bolton, founded the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston
                    and Wallace corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members
                    of the Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet
                    and published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace,
