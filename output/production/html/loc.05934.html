                will likely see him about 20th or a few days later. I
                expect to see you about middle of next month at which time I leave here for a good
                long holiday. I am pretty tired out. Mrs. B. &amp; children are well, weather
                delightfull here and the place looks well</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am quite anxious to see you again and have a long chat. What about Mary Smith? is
                she married? Is she back in America, or is she coming back soon?</p>
