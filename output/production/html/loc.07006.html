                    Jeannette L. Gilder wrote to Whitman, in his words, "that she is going to write
                    my life &amp; asking for items &amp;c" (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–69],
                    3:141). Although Whitman complied with her request, nothing came of the
                    proposal. About the same time, in a letter to John Burroughs of <a href="uva.00391">December 23–25, 1878</a>, Whitman wrote: "(I
                    would like best to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">told about</span> in strings of continuous
                    anecdotes, incidents, mots, thumbnail personal sketches, characteristic &amp;

                    scrupulously a few years letter by Richard Maurice Bucke in his biography of the
                    poet. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
