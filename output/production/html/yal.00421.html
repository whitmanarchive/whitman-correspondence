        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Yours of 5th has reach'd me. Though mainly the same as for a tedious long while, I have
        fluctuated (&amp; am fluctuating) through a series of bad spells—brain &amp; other
        organs—these current times. My general strength, however, from fair to middling. Dont
        feel to leave my anchorage here, just now—but hope yet to take advantage of your
        affectionate &amp; hospitable offers. </p>

        <p class="tei_p">The engraving holds its own—satisfies me more &amp; more—Joaquin Miller has visited me here—very pleasant—</p>
