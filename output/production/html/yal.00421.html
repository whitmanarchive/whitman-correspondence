      <p class="tei_p">Yours of 5th has reach'd me. Though mainly the same as for a tedious long while, I have

        organs—these current times. My general strength, however, from fair to middling. Dont

        affectionate &amp; hospitable offers. </p>

                    1875, at which time he probably renewed the invitation to visit New Haven that
                    he had made in his earlier letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n0360">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0360 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0360"><span>William James Linton
                    (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the U. S. in 1867 and
                    settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated 
                    the works of John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth
                    Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and others, wrote the "indispensable" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in America</span> (1882), and edited
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poetry of America, 1776–1876</span> (London, 1878),
                    which included eight of Whitman's poems and the poet's picture. Linton's
                    engraving of Whitman appeared in the 1876 version of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span>
                    (1888–1889), and in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt
                        Whitman</span> (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 10 vols., 2:156; it also inspired the poem "Out from
                    Behind This Mask." See Harold Blodgett, "Whitman and the Linton Portrait," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Newsletter</span>, 4 (1958), 90–92.
                    According to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
                        1890—Recollections</span> (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1894),
                    216–217, Linton met with Whitman in Washington and later visited him in
                    Camden, which Whitman reported in his <a href="loc.01621">November 9,
                        1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle. Linton wrote of Whitman: "I liked the man
                    much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet who could not
                    write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." Linton's
                    obituary in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> of January 8, 1898, called
                    Linton "the greatest wood engraver of his time, an artist in other senses, and a
                    poet of no mean ability." </span></span> [<a href="#r0360">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_yal.00421_n2 note" id="yal.00421_n2"><span>Nothing further is known about this
