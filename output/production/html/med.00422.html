      <p class="tei_p">…There is his old Brooklyn partner…who is also a natural builder and carpenter 
        (practically and in effect) architect. … My brother thinks (and I think so, too) 
        that if you have not committed yourself, you could not do better than to get Smith to plan and supervise and practically work with you…an honest, conscientious, 
        old-fashioned man, a man of family…youngish-middle-aged—you would like him—I do—…If you need him, &amp; he will go, he is your man.

      <p class="tei_p">John, I think 'The Birds of the Poets' your best article, in many respects—it has a jaunty air, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in a perfectly natural way</span>—flits and hops and soars 
        and sings around in a birdish way itself …I shall remain here for the present.
