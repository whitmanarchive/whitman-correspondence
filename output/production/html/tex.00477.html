            <p class="tei_p">Thanks, dear friend, for your love &amp; remembrance &amp; faith &amp;
                liberality—And thanks with same to Bessie &amp; Isabella Ford &amp; William
                &amp; Ethel &amp; Arthur Thompson—(The letter—somehow one of the best I
                ever rec'd—goes to my heart—of May 18 with the draft 194:95 reaches me
                    safely)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am here yet, much the same, to say it summarily, fairly jolly—go out now
                sometimes in a wheel chair, exceptionally for an hour or two to the river shore when
                I feel like it—have a good strong young Canadian (Ed Wilkins) for my helper
                &amp; nurse—have just had what I call my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">currying for the
                    mid-day</span>—&amp; am probably getting along better than you all might
                suppose—fortunately my right &amp; left arms are left me in good strength
                &amp; volition, (in the terrible wreck &amp; almost helplessness of the rest of the
                body)—There is somewhat against my wish &amp; advice to be a sort of public
                &amp; speechifying dinner &amp;c. in compliment to my finishing my 70th year, here
                in Camden, towards even'g May 31—I will send you any acc't may be—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have lately seen Herbert Gilchrist—he is well &amp; flourishing—The
                Staffords are well &amp; much the same—I have not sent your &amp; the Misses
                Fords' big books (Complete Works) yet—Shall probably send in a box to Mrs:
                Costelloe, 40 Grosvenor Road, the Embankment, London, but I shall send you word
                when—You &amp; the Fords &amp; the rest have help'd me more than you
                know—</p>
