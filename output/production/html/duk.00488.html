                    Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor

                    Heyde (1823–1908) was Walt Whitman's younger sister, and she was one of
                    the only members of the Whitman family to read and admire Whitman's writings.
                    She married Charles Heyde in 1852, and the couple lived in Burlington, Vermont.
                    Charles regularly disparaged his wife and her sometimes erratic behavior in his
                    letters. For more information on Hannah, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
