                    (1799–1870), who went to the Treasury Department as a clerk in 1822 and
                    held various posts in that bureau until his death. He was the author of several
                    satirical works, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Peter Schlemihl in America</span>
                    (Philadelphia: Carey and Hart, 1848) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Gates Wide Open;
                        or, Scenes in Another World</span> (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1858; rev. ed.
                    1870); see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">National Cyclopaedia of American Biography</span>.
                    Undoubtedly he became acquainted with Whitman through William and Ellen
                    O'Connor. Ellen mentions a Mr. Wood in her letter of <a href="loc.00943">July 5, 1864</a>, (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). See also Wood's
                    letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.00878">January 15, 1863</a> and
                    Whitman's <a href="hav.00002">July 17, 1863</a> letter to Wood. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
