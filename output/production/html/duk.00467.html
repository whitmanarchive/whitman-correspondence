                    likely date for this letter. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to late
                    March 1866. Edwin Haviland Miller assigned the approximate date of March 27,
                    1866 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New
                    York University Press, 1961–77], 1:272, n. 5). It is possible that the
                    letter dates as early as March 25, 1866, but that is probably too early because
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman forwarded to Walt Whitman a letter she had received
                    from daughter Hannah Heyde, which dates to March 24, 1866. It is also possible,
                    but unlikely, that this letter dates to as late as March 27, 1866, but this late
                    date is unlikely because Walt acknowledged receipt of Louisa's letter "this
                    morning" with Hannah's letter enclosed on March 28, 1866 (see Walt's <a href="nyp.00204">March 28,1866</a> letter to Louisa). </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    between the Browns and the Whitmans was often strained, but the Browns remained
