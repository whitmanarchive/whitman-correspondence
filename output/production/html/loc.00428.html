            <p class="tei_p">I have just telegraphed to you that Andrew was dead.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Poor boy he died much eaiser than one would have supposed. I do hope to God you will come on. I have been with him, Mary, Mother Mat and I, almost all the time since you left. Mary and I watched last night. He has been dying ever since Wednesday morning—full 24 hours—Poor Nancy, she takes it woful hard  Mary has acted like the best of women  It is very affecting to see Nancy and the children  Mattie did everything that she possibly could<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>  She watched with us till near 3oclk this morning  Andrew was very desirous of having us all around him when he died. The poor boy seemed to think that that would take nearly all the horror of it away. If you will come on I will try and give you the passage money. Mother and the rest take it very hard. I hope to get an answer by telegraph.</p>

                    correspond in November 1863 because the poet was home for a visit from November
                    2 until December 1. Knowing that Andrew was near death, Walt attempted to
                    bolster the family before the impending crisis. When Andrew died two days after
                    Walt returned to Washington, new conflicts created even greater tension in the
                    Whitman household.<p class="tei_p">The worst of these conflicts resulted from the mental
                        disorders of Jesse, the oldest Whitman brother. The genesis of Jesse's
                        illness is not clear. One account is that he injured his head in a fall from
                        a ship's mast, another that he was beaten on the head by thugs using brass
                        knuckles (see Katherine Molinoff, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Some Notes on Whitman's
                            Family</span>, Monographs on Unpublished Whitman Material, no. 2
                        [Brooklyn: Comet Press, 1941], 19–22). Jeff, however, suggests that
                        Jesse suffered from syphilis. For much of 1863 Jesse enjoyed good relations
                        with the Jefferson Whitman family: he played amicably with Hattie and rocked
                        Jessie in her cradle (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War
                            Letters of George Washington Whitman</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke
                        University Press, 1975], 91; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman,
                        August 31, 1863 [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke
                        University]). But on December 4, in reaction to Andrew's death, Jesse
                        exhibited a vicious outburst of temper that convinced Jeff that his eldest
                        brother should be committed. Mother Whitman persuaded Walt that she could
                        still care for Jesse, so no immediate action was taken (Louisa Van Velsor
                        Whitman to Walt Whitman, December 25, 1863 [Trent]). Jesse's condition must
                        have deteriorated, however, for Walt committed him to King's County Lunatic
                        Asylum on December 5, 1864, where he remained until his death on March 21,
                        1870.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00428_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00428_n2"><span>This telegram is not

                    Velsor Whitman, Mattie remained at Andrew's side the day before he died "nearly

                     then she came home and mary and Jeffy staid all night...they had to fan him all
                    night and bathe him in brandy...when she [Nancy] came out in the morning she
                    brought such a smell that Jeffy got sick" (letter to Walt Whitman, December 4,
