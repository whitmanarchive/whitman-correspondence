            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just telegraphed to you that Andrew was dead. Poor boy he died much eaiser than one would have supposed. I do hope to God you will come on. I have been with him, Mary, Mother Mat and I, almost all the time since you left. Mary and I watched last night. He has been dying ever since Wednesday morning—full 24 hours—Poor Nancy, she takes it woful hard  Mary has acted like the best of women  It is very affecting to see Nancy and the children  Mattie did everything that she possibly could  She watched with us till near 3oclk this morning  Andrew was very desirous of having us all around him when he died. The poor boy seemed to think that that would take nearly all the horror of it away. If you will come on I will try and give you the passage money. Mother and the rest take it very hard. I hope to get an answer by telegraph.</p>
