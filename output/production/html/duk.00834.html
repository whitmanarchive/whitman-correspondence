            <p class="tei_p">Much the same with me. No further news of O'Connor, (I forward the "Transcripts" you send me, to him.) Rhys writes me that the Walter
                Scott, Eng[lish] pub's, will bring out my "Spec: Days" in one vol. &amp; "Dem:
                Vistas, &amp;c" in another. I have just sent on a little
                preface to S D. I forward a Peora paperâ€”when you have read it, mail to Dr
                Bucke. I have just had an autograph hunter visitor, but with cheery talk and
                presence. </p>
