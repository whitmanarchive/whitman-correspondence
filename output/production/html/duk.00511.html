                    year December 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt

                    and the letter's concern, that Martha Mitchell Whitman was dissatisfied with her
                    new place and decided to return to St. Louis with Thomas Jefferson Whitman, is
                    consistent with late 1867. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00465_n9 note" id="duk.00465_n9"><span>Martha Mitchell Whitman

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
