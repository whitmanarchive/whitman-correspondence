                letter with the 5 doller all first
                rate and i should have wrote
                yesterday but i went down to
                matts
                for the first i had not
                been down to their place before)
                george came home yesterday
                morning thinks likely he will
                stay till after new year s
                as something in the foundry
                is broken and will take time
                to be repaird    
                george dont know
                as he will be there much longer
                but will be employed
                in brooklyn) we are about the
                same as usual matty and
                the children are going back
                with jeff after taking the place
                and getting the things unpacked
                they have fairly decided
                to return with him she dont
                like her place at all and
                would move again if she
                staid so she thinks she
