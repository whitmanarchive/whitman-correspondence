            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Yr's just came telling me of y'r moving—As you don't mention my letter of ten
                days since contain'g the little printed slips (in lieu) of preface I suppose it
                &amp; they have not reach'd you—so I enclose two
                more—Or do they not suit? If so, let them go—I wanted to go on record
                embalming (as much as I could) my tribute of dear W[illiam]'s memory
                &amp; past. Y'r letter to-day is the first I have heard f'm you in two months &amp;
                    over—Dr Bucke is well
                &amp; busy—I hear f'm him often. I continue on ab't the same—slowly
                letting down peg after peg—my mind &amp; my right arm remain'g abt the
                same—I want to finish &amp; print a 2d little annex (the last) to L. of G.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting in my room in Mickle Street in the big old ratan chair with wolf-skin
                spread on back—have a little fire in stove—cool weather—bright sun
                out—was taken out in wheel chair yesterday afternoon—What is
                doing—or what has been done—abt the book of tales &amp;c:?—John
                Burroughs has just been to see me—He, wife &amp; boy
                still on their Hudson river farm—</p>
