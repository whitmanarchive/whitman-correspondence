            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">We arrived here all safe at last—(after adventures)—had to cross the river late of a dark night in broken ice, in a little row boat, mid a furious snow storm (this house is on the west bank Hudson)—the natives advised us not to try it, but Harry &amp; I said <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cross</span>, &amp; Mr. Burroughs consented—it was quite interesting—It looks like winter here, snow 8 inches deep in every direction—but I like it much—a far view from my window of miles of river, mountains, rocks &amp; woods—quite a change of scene from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​ —We are very comfortable here, folks are (as every where) very kind to us—Harry has gone across the river in a row boat with Mr B. all the forenoon—&amp; I have spent mine alone in the library writing, &amp; frequently looking out at the grand show of scenery, in winter garb—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Love to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you all</span>, to Al and May, and the childer—to Mr Waters—(&amp; even the picture)—May return either Tuesday or Wednesday for a couple of days or so—</p>
