            <p class="tei_p">Y'r good letter 29/9 &amp; the newspaper came this mn'g
                &amp; was welcome, as always—am cheer'd to hear
                f'm you all, &amp; y'r affectionate treatment of me, thro' L of G. See you must have
                rec'd all my letters, papers, slips &amp; scraps, &amp; Dr Bucke's book (remember that Dr B gives his coloring f'm the eye of a
                zealous friend—I know well enough that W W is not a quarter as good as B makes
                him out, but is full of defects &amp; vagaries &amp; faults)—I have since sent
                you report of R G Ingersoll's big lecture in Philadelphia here
                Oct. 21—I have rec'd from it (&amp; him)
                $869.45 wh' keeps me in bread &amp; meat &amp; shanty-keeping a good time
                yet—I also send to you printed slip, "Old Poets"
                my latest piece—am not sure but this internationality of P O &amp; mails (I
                got a letter this mn'g. all safe f'm Nagasaki, written very fair English, f'm a
                young Japanese reader &amp; absorber of L of G) is the grandest proof of modern
                civilization, practical brotherhood &amp; Christianity—we feel it here in the
                U S f'm Canada to Texas, &amp; f'm Atlantic side to Pacific shore—&amp; you
                must too in Australia—Am mainly ab't same in health but slowly dimming &amp;
                the pegs coming gradually out as I call it—this <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">grip</span>
                has hold of me thoroughly, &amp; bladder trouble badly—but I keep fair spirits
                &amp; suppose mentality &amp; (as before written) fair appetite &amp;
                sleep—have a good nurse, Warren Fritzinger a
                strong hearty good natured young American man, has been f'm boyhood a sailor &amp;
                all round the world—go out in propell'd wheel chair—was out last evn'g
                to a friend's &amp; wife's to supper, (drank a bottle of first rate champagne)—when you 
                write don't be afraid to send me ab't

                peculiarities, occupations &amp;c. (Under the thin glaze-surface of
                conventionalities, as here a vast plummetless-depth of democratic humanity is
                existing, thinking, acting, ebbing &amp; flowing—there no doubt—that I
                would like O so like to flatter myself I am giving or trying to give voice
                to)—I am leisurely cooking up a little 2d annex for my L of G, &amp; a
                collected appendix for Nov. Boughs. I enclose you a couple of
                slips of my last poemet in Dec. Phila. Lippincott's
                    Magazine—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Barney, you don't know how much you &amp; all there have done me—words by pen
                &amp; ink are poor perhaps but O how I wish to give you all &amp; each a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">God bless you</span> &amp; my love to you &amp; the dear wife
