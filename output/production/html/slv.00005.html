                    and his wife, Evangeline Mina Fryer, began a weekly discussion club with secular
                    and Whitmanesque inclinations called the Australeum. His letter of March 12,
                    1890, began a correspondence with Whitman that lasted until November 1, 1891,
                    and assumed the character of a religious experience, always saluting Whitman
                    with reverential appellations. For more, see Alan L. McLeod, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_367.html">Whitman in Australia and New Zealand</a>," J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
