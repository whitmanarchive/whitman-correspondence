            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall return to Washington next Saturday, 15th—William, it would be a favor
                if you would secure me a room to lodge &amp; quarter in—(look at the Dyer
                Hotel—it is a one-horse place, but might answer—or the Union hotel at
                Georgetown)—just needed for temporary purposes, (unless I find it
                sufficiently inviting to make me a "permanency")—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I do not feel to be very particular—only it would be so much off one's mind to
                have a specific point to make for—Write to me, so that I may get the letter
                Friday, 14th—or else meet me at the depot at 10 Saturday evening, if
                eligible—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">All goes "as well as could be expected" with me—that's the phrase you know in
                parturition cases—&amp; have not I been just delivered—&amp; of
                    triplets?—I am hearty in
                health, &amp; good spirits, Mother is well—also George—&amp; in fact the
                whole Whitman family.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Have not heard a word from you or Nelly, since your letter—Has Nelly returned
                yet? Where is Charles Eldridge? I write this in my room home, early
                afternoon—Mother &amp; I having had tete-a-tete dinner—so good &amp;
                quiet—&amp; this bright mellow October weather around us—I am now off
                for a couple of hours on the river &amp; bay.</p>
