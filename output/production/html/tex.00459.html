            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to get your card &amp; to hear that your 
                health was improved. I thought surely we should see you 
                as you returned from Canada in Sept. I had made great reckoning
                of a long visit with you. We have all been well. I send you 
                a late picture of Julian, but it does not flatter 
                him. He talks everything
                
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00007a_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex_ao.00007a_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00007a_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">tex_ao.00007a_large.jpg</span>
                I showed him your picture in Scribner, &amp; asked him 
                who it was. "It is uncle Alt" he said. I think 
                that picture a good one, better than the photo from which 
                it was taken. Stedman was here in June &amp; I let 
                him have two or three pictures to choose from. He said 
                he had had a big fight with Holland, but had conquered, 
                Holland would have neither piece nor picture. I am 
                satisfied with the essay. It is better than I expected 
                It is my philosophy always 
                
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00007b_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex_ao.00007b_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00007b_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">tex_ao.00007b_large.jpg</span>
                to accept the good &amp; let the bad go to the dogs. The good 
                in the essay will help us; the bad no body will heed 
            It will bring you readers &amp; friends &amp; that is enough. The 
                article is candid &amp; respectful &amp; that is all we can ask. 
                This is a free country &amp; Stedman can think &amp; say what he 
                pleases, so long as he keeps within the bounds of legitimate 
                criticism. His argument is very weak in places, notably 
                on the procreation business. To 
                compare sex &amp; what goes with it, to mud &amp; slime that 
                nature covers up, is a fatal error. In fact it seems 
                
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00006a_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex_ao.00006a_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00006a_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">tex_ao.00006a_large.jpg</span>         
                to me that the adverse criticisms in the paper are all 
                weak &amp; ineffectual, &amp; that he is truly at home only when 
                he is appreciative. How gingerly he does walk at times to be 
                sure, as if he feared the ground underfoot was mined. He 
                wrote a propitiatory letter to both me &amp; O'Connor, before 
                the article appeared. He evidently had a wholesome 
                dread of O'Connor's war whoop &amp; scalping knife. But 
                S. is a generous fellow, think how much better he is than 
                the set to which he belongs. 
             A young man from Cambridge Mass. (W.S. Kennedy) 
                writes me that he had a

                furious talk with Stedman about the article, &amp; that he 
                himself has written a paper that will appear in the 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Californian</span> soon, which he 
                thinks does you fuller justice. I do not know him, but he says he expects 
                to go to Phila. soon to work 
                on the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">American</span>, a news 
                paper started there. He says 
                his paper was accepted by the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">International</span>, &amp; then
                returned on account of Mr Lodge, one of the editors.
            Dr Bucke is a good fellow, but between me &amp; 
                you, I am a little shy of him; I fear he lacks

                balance &amp; proportion &amp; that his book will not be

                injustice.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
