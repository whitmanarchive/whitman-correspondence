                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke

                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
