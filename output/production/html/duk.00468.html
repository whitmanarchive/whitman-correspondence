                    December 3, 1865. "December 3" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1865, and Edwin Haviland Miller also dated the
                    letter to December 3, 1865 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    1:377). December 3 fell on a Sunday in 1865—Louisa wrote "it is
                    sunday"—and the date is consistent both with the recent dismissal of
                    workers in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and with similar family topics in Louisa's

                    the Whitmans for his offensive letters and treatment of Hannah. Louisa in her
                        <a href="duk.00461">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman had
                    labeled Heyde a "little conceited fool." According to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"

                    visited Hannah in September 1865 because of a quarrel about "some women that

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
                    George, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00468_n4 note" id="duk.00468_n4"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
                    account was based on the reports in the Democratic-leaning<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>. The Navy Yard workers were organized by
                    profession: carpenters, plumbers, caulkers, etc. The dismissal of workers was in
                    part connected to post-war demobilization. Though sympathetic to striking
                    workers, the newspaper was generally hostile to the "bosses" in the large
                    federal labor force, which it considered beholden to the Republican
                    administration. For articles that address recent layoffs, anxiety about the
                    political power of the yard bosses, and a caulker's strike, see "The Political
                    Guillotine at Work, Excitement in the Navy Yard" and "The Navy Yard" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, December 5, 1865, 2). Jake Striker,
                    if an individual boss in the Navy Yard, has not been identified. The name may
                    also have been a derogatory term for striking workers. The reason for Louisa's
                    animus against a particular man is unknown—and is contrary to her usual
                    sympathy for discharged workers—but her son George Washington Whitman may
                    have crossed a politically powerful yard boss in his housebuilding
                    business. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n24">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00468_n24 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00468_n24"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    was thrifty during the war because she hoped to preserve her own funds for the
                    future (see her <a href="duk.00429">September 5–23, 1863</a> letter
                    to Walt Whitman). Walt had encouraged her to use George Washington Whitman's
                    substantial military pay to buy better food for herself and for his brother
                    Andrew Jackson Whitman during his illness, and Walt had enlisted George to
                    pressure their mother to spend more freely from George's pay (see Walt's <a href="loc.00794">October 6, 1863</a> letter to Louisa and George's <a href="duk.00348">December 9, 1863</a> letter to Louisa). Louisa's
                    careful husbanding helped George to finance his speculative housebuilding
                    business after the war, but in this letter Louisa regrets having exhausted the
                    bank book in her own name. As no particular one-time expense is noted in her
                    letters, her savings probably diminished gradually for living expenses. </span></span> [<a href="#r24">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00468_n5 note" id="duk.00468_n5"><span>The "last one" is Louisa Van

                    Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
