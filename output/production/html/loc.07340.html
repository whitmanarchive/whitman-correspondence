                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

Bucke had
                        long been a reader of Browning, and at one time he had even thought of
                        writing on the poet. Bucke had acquired <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ring and the
                            Book</span> (1868–69) as it came out in parts. On February 19, 1869,
                        he wrote Harry Buxton Forman:</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">"I have been so excessively busy this year . . . that I have not yet read
                        Browning's new poem, that is the parts of it that I have viz. I. &amp; II.
                        and I do not think I shall read it at all now except an occasional dip into
                        it until I get the rest of it—I know from what I have seen of it that
                        it is a great work" (For this letter, see the collection at the D. B. Weldon
                        Library, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario). Gradually, Bucke
                        became involved in the work (see letters to H.B. Forman of May 16, 1869 and
                        April 1–13, 1870), and on August 9, 1870, he wrote Harry Buxton
                        Forman: "I shall probably have a go at the 'Ring and Book.' Also shall
                        perhaps find time to elaborate my theory as to the guilt of Pamphilia of
                        which I am firmly persuaded. Mind you, in speaking of this matter I take for
                        granted that everything that Browning says about her is the exact truth and
                        that this is all we do or can know about her. Browning himself, according to
                        my hypothesis, may or may not think her guilty. He is merely a faithful
                        reporter of the evidence in the case and can only have an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">opinion</span> about it just like anybody else. I
                        consider it a mighty pretty subject for an essay and feel greatly tempted at
                        times to try and get up something rather effective on the subject" (For this
                        letter, see the collection at the D. B. Weldon Library, University of
                        Western Ontario, London, Ontario).</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07340_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07340_n3"><span>Bucke is referring to Bret

                    "It's a hot night. I disremember any sich weather before on the Bar." Bucke may
