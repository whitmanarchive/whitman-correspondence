                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I take it by the enclosed from Rossetti that he has sent me the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster</span> by mail to Washington, &amp; that it is now there, probably in the A. G. office. You go down &amp; see, &amp; get it to read. (May be in p. o.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother's health is about reëstablished if nothing unfavorable occurs. I shall return to Washington early next week. I start this afternoon for New Haven for one day only—an emergency—an artist friend of mine is very low there with consumption—is in fact dying—&amp; has expressed the most earnest wish to see me—We have been, &amp; are, having a cold easterly rain storm here—I enclose, on loan, the last two photos of my most sweetly philosophic &amp; fascinating self—(for you to gaze upon till I return)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Swinburne Hilliard</span> article has been copied in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Home Journal</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Not a word of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster</span> article—The ungodly, (sorely tried,) will of course endeavor to ignore it, &amp; leave it entirely unmentioned &amp; uncommented on, if possible—but that will <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> be possible—It is a powerful essay—I have been reading it over carefully a second time—It strikes the true chords—even the name "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Poetry of Democracy</span>" &amp;c—is it not pregnant? from your loving old</p>
