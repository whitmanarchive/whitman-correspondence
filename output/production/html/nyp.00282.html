                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's health, Jeff and his family visited her in the fall;
                    Martha visited her mother-in-law in the spring or early summer. Martha and her
                    children went to Camden to see George's wife Louisa, whom he had married on
                    April 14, 1871. On <a href="duk.00604">October 10, 1871</a>, Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman wrote to Walt Whitman: "george and loo and Jeff insists on my
                    breaking up houskeeping. they dident only insist but almost commanded me. i told them i should remain here
                    this winter (if i lived). they none of them want edd, walter, and they would
                    soon get tired of paying his board and we aint much expence to any but you, walter dear, for any thing but houseroom." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00282_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="nyp.00282_n3"><span>Charles Hine, a painter
                    to whom Whitman wrote on <a href="loc.01579">May 9, 1868</a>. On <a href="loc.01726">August 4, 1871</a> Hine's wife informed Whitman of her
                    husband's death: "I think after your visit to him that his hold on life seemed
                    to give way and his yearnings were all accomplished." Mrs. Hine, who visited
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on August 22, 1871, thought it "strange" that Whitman
                    did not write. According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter of <a href="duk.00605">September 30, 1871</a>, Mrs. Hine had received a
                    "donation" from Walt Whitman. Whitman also wrote of Charles Hine's illness in
                    his <a href="loc.01580">July 28, 1871</a> letter to Peter Doyle. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00282_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00282_n4"><span>The New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span> of July 24, 1871, reprinted Lucy Fountain's
