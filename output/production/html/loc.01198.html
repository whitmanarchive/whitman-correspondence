            <p class="tei_p">I want to get your new book (the "Two Rivulets" I think it is 
                called) for a friend of mine on his next Birthday July 1st 1876. 
                I asked for it at one of the largest book stores in this place 
                but they did not have it, so I thought the best way would be 
                to write to you. I would much prefer to send to you for it if 
                you will be kind enough to send it please let me know the price. 
                My friend is a great admirer of yours. him and I have lately been 
                reading your "Leaves of Grass" and

                "Drum Taps" and we are very much pleased with them. I admire and 
                respect you very much for the way in which you write about Mr Abraham 
                Lincoln, our Brave Soldiers, and the African race. I think Mr Lincoln 
                was one of the best men that ever lived. our Soldiers we can not 
                praise them <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">to​ </span><span class="tei_corr">too​

                    time ago. perhaps you remember him. his name is C. W. Hine. 
                    I know he would appreciate one of your Books better than anything 
                    else I could give him</p>
