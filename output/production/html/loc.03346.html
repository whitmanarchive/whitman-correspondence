                picture I wrote you of for the card, because he is a man of singular genius, and
                appreciates deeply <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>, the central sum of
                which, and permeating all its parts without exception, is, he thinks, spirituality.
                I think he would have given us something rarely good — something artistically
                bold, anyway, though maybe not. But he cannot do it this year, and I understand is
                getting ready to go for study to Italy.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Send me back the letter when you have done with it, that I may write to Dr. Channing,

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
