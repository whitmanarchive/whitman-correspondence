            <p class="tei_p">I enclose for your information a letter I got yesterday from Dr. Channing about the calendar, which reads well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Today I have a letter from Stedman, in which he cordially
                undertakes the task of getting a publisher. I think this very good of him, as he is
                quite driven with all sorts of commissions.</p>

                picture I wrote you of for the card, because he is a man of singular genius, and
                appreciates deeply <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>, the central sum of
                which, and permeating all its parts without exception, is, he thinks, spirituality.
                I think he would have given us something rarely good — something artistically
                bold, anyway, though maybe not. But he cannot do it this year, and I understand is
                getting ready to go for study to Italy.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I did not know that the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">M.S.</span> of the calendar was to be
                placed in Stedman's hands, but it could not be better nor friendlier.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Send me back the letter when you have done with it, that I may write to Dr. Channing,
                who has been very laborious and earnest in the matter. Grace, the cherub deviser of
                the scheme, is now up at Bristol, Rhode Island.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been much comforted by the newspaper reports about you, as by your card of the
                27th ultimo, though I realize how badly ill you still must be. But I have strong hopes.

                the summer!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I myself am pretty bad— very back-achy and weak-leggy. But, like Webster, we
                still live, and who can get us under!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad you can sit up and work a little on your book, which must be a comfort.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have another letter from Dr. Bucke, whom I treat
                disgracefully, not answering promptly. But it is pretty hard to write and keep the
                office stone rolled up the hill daily.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All consolation! All cheer!</p>
