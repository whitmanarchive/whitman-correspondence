Sheffield is finely situated, magnificent hill country all round about, and on the hills for miles &amp; miles (on one side of the town) elegant villa residences—and in the valley below one enduring cloud of smoke, and a pale faced teeming population, and tall chimneys and ash heaps covered with squalid children picking them over, and dirty alleys, and courts

There is a great deal of distress just now—so many now being out of work—and it is impossible to pass through the streets without seeing it obvious in some form or other. (A man burst into floods of tears the other day when I gave him a bit of silver). But each individual is such a mere unit in the great crowd and

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    (1849–1934) was among Edward Carpenter's circle of Whitman admirers in
                    England. On November 13, Carpenter sent Whitman—in a letter now
                    lost—Vines's request for books. On <a href="prc.00065">November 27,
                        1877</a>, Whitman sent the books (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span>) and a post card to Vines. Whitman also
                    sent a letter to Carpenter on <a href="duk.00743">November 27</a>, noting,
                    "have to-day mailed Mr Vines' books." At that time, Vines was Fellow and
                    Lecturer in Botany at Christ's College, Cambridge, and later was named
                    Sherardian Professor of Botany at Oxford. Vines's copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> inscribed by Whitman, "Sidney H. Vines from the
                    author," was among the books offered for sale in the Spring 2001 catalog of
