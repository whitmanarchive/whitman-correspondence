            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am here seeing to the setting up &amp; stereotyping of my book in a big printing
                office, (Rand &amp; Avery.)—Every thing goes
                satisfactory enough, so far. I suppose you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  the paper (or papers?) I sent—they will give you some <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​  of two or three little happenings in my jaunt—I was down on Long
                Island at the spot where I was born &amp; where I had spent my summers in youth from
                time to time—went around to all the old places I hadn't seen before for 40
                years—seems to me now the most beautiful region on earth—Dr Bucke was
                with me &amp; he thought so too—Before I went there, I was at Rockaway (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Long Island​ ">L I</span>​ ) &amp; at Long Branch (N J)—The last two weeks I have been in N Y
                City—So you see I have been the rounds—I am pretty well—&amp; have
                been so—</p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00222_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00222_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00222_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall probably stay here a month or more—Dear boy I wish you would write to
                me a good long letter &amp; tell me all the news, especially about yourself. Direct
                to me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">care of Osgood &amp; Co: 211 Tremont Street, Boston, Mass:</span> and I shall get it. I have not been much about Boston this
                time, but it is a lively place to be in—the streets all crumpled up, short,
                and more corners &amp; angles than any thing else, but clean &amp;
                handsome—this forenoon I have been some time on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the
                    Common</span> (an old Park of 60 or 70 acres right in the midst of the city with
                lots of fine very old trees)—I am now writing this in Osgood's place in Boston
                (they are the publishers of my book)—How are you &amp; all getting along?—I wish you to give my love to your father &amp; mother—Debbie &amp; Jo Ed,
                Mont, &amp; Van—Ruth &amp; little George—&amp; tell them I remember the
                good times I have had, past summers—&amp; show this letter to them, if they
                wish—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is now nearly 1, &amp; I must go off to my dinner—God bless you dear boy
                &amp; farewell for this time—I shall write again before long—</p>
