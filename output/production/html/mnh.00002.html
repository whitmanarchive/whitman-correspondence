                    (1815–1900) was a suffragist and abolitionist who later founded the

                    the couple's home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Leggett, who was also
                    the grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
                    from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in
