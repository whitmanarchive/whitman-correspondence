                    and inventor, specializing in bridge construction. He was associated with the
                    Dominion Bridge Company and served as manager of the Baltimore Bridge Company.
                    He worked on bridges in the American Northwest and then in New England, where he
                    supervised structural engineering projects in Springfield, Massachusetts, then
                    in Montreal. He served as the President of the American Society of Civil
                    Engineers. He was a friend of Horace Traubel's and a great admirer of Whitman
                    and his work. He attended Whitman's final birthday dinner on May 31, 1891. He is
                    mentioned numerous times in Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>, and Whitman greatly admired Bush, calling him a "noble fellow"

                    Phildelphia publisher David McKay in 1892. This volume, often referred to as the
                    "deathbed" edition, reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex, called "Sands at Seventy," consisted of
                    sixty-five poems that had originally appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
                        Boughs</span> (1888); while the second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection
                    of thirty-one short poems taken from the gathering of prose and poetry published
                    under that title by McKay in 1891, along with a prose "Preface Note to 2d
                    Annex." Whitman concluded the 1891–92 volume with his prose essay "A
                    Backward Glance o'er Travel'd Roads," which had originally appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span>. For more information on this volume of
