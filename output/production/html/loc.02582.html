            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I thought of coming round to see you all last Sunday, but it was so hot &amp; I didn't get over to Camden—didn't feel like walking up from the ferry—Jack I am stopping up here in 22d street for a week or two—they are very kind to me, &amp; very jovial &amp; we have real good times—the young man, about 21, he &amp; I are very thick—then there are two grown daughters—the eldest one is a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">class</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">trump</span>, she is my favorite every way—she is studying at the woman's Medical University here—the mother Mrs Gilchrist, is a very fine lady,—we have good meals, &amp; take our time over them—I have the best room in the house, breezy &amp; cool (&amp; the water in it)—&amp; a young English college Professor, Mr Carpenter, is staying here for a few days—though a stranger he is a great friend of mine &amp; indeed has come over from England to see me—(But I have written enough of all that—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Jack I wonder if I shall ever be with you, or rather have you with me, so that we can have some good times together on land or water—I used to think of having a shanty of my own there in Camden, &amp; I thought I shouldn't be satisfied without having you &amp; Ida up there to take supper with me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">two evenings</span> in the week at least—I wonder if it is ever coming to pass—
            
            Mean time I shall come around <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">next Sunday</span>, if you are all at home—Tell Ida to put her hair in curl papers Saturday night—&amp; though I do not wish the fatted calf slaughtered on Sunday morning—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I hope there will be some spear mint ready to pull in the garden</span>—Johnny how does it go with you?—Love to mother &amp; father &amp; tell 'em I'm coming round next Sunday—Here is a kiss for you, Jack, &amp; take care of yourself, &amp; don't forget your loving friend</p>
