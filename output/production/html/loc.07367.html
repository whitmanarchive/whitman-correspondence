            <p class="tei_p">Over two weeks ago I determined to let Major Pond<a href="#n3112" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3112">1</a> manage your

                knows just how to do it. He said I might calculate three hundred and fifty dollars
                as the cost—the output, and he would guarantee to fill a hall. I at once
                assumed the responsibility and became security for the three hundred and fifty
                dollars. He then tried to get Chickering Hall but it was engaged for April 14th and
                also for every afternoon and evening about that date. We have at last settled upon
                the Madison Square Theatre for the afternoon (four o'clock) of April 14th.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> I must pay the seventy five dollars for the Theatre the
                moment it is engaged, and I will do so the moment I receive a telegram from you
                to-morrow saying, "all right, go ahead." Please wire me at once on receipt of
                this.</p>

                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor

                    Whitman: "Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his life. They
                    were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the theatres of New
                    York City"; Pond concludes with an anecdote about the poet's meeting with Sir

                    over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
