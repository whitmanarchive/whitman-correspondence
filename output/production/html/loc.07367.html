            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">Over two weeks ago I determined to let Major Pond manage your
                    lecture. He is "up" in that kind of business and
                knows just how to do it. He said I might calculate three hundred and fifty dollars
                as the costâ€”the output, and he would guarantee to fill a hall. I at once
                assumed the responsibility and became security for the three hundred and fifty
                dollars. He then tried to get Chickering Hall but it was engaged for April 14th and
                also for every afternoon and evening about that date. We have at last settled upon
                the Madison Square Theatre for the afternoon (four o'clock) of April 14th. I must pay the seventy five dollars for the Theatre the
                moment it is engaged, and I will do so the moment I receive a telegram from you
                to-morrow saying, "all right, go ahead." Please wire me at once on receipt of
                this.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Alma is here with me and is well and says: "Lots of love and
                thanks for the nice letter received at Equinunk."</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Ever yours sincerely</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">J. H. Johnston.</span>
