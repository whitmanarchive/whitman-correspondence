                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your two postcards are to hand. I expect the printed
                slips to Preface and Additional Note have reached you ere this; I told the
                publishers to forward them. We have taken great pains to make the reprint
                correct—following the American spelling, &amp;c., faithfully. It is all out of
                my hands now, and I do hope everything will turn out well. It has been rather a
                troubled time with me lately, with far too much work on hand to do everything with
                the ample margin for revisal that I like, but all's well that ends well. As there
                was some uncertainty about the process reproduction of that photo, for frontispiece
                or inserted plate, and having the unlucky experience of the portrait in L. of G. to
                go by, we decided to leave the portrait out altogether. Better none at all, as you
                say, than a bad one.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">By this post I send a copy of the Pall Mall Gazette with a paragraph taken from the
                Additional Note to the new vol. The P.M.G usually treats me rather cavalierly over
                my own things: the young fellows who do the literary part, and do it capitally
                too—Henry Norman<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>, O. Wilde<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> and so on—are
                most of them university men, with rather a contempt for unacademic outsiders. In
                the case of this paragraph I got young Horne to propose it to Norman, and so worked
                the oracle. In the same paper, notice the article, Some April Insects, by Richard
                    Jefferies.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> I think you will like it. Jefferies is
                one of our best writers on Nature over here; his writing is at once true and subtle,
                and very natural and simple withal. Did you ever read his Story of My Heart? A very
                passionate confession of faith and fear it was, with a sentiment in it that made
                some of the critics say it must be inspired by your L. of G. If you have not yet
                seen it, I should like to send it on. Jefferies is editing the vol. to follow yours
                in the series—White's Selborne. He writes to tell me that he is an invalid,
                poor lover of all things bright and helpful. He lives down in Sussex, near the
                sea.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">W.S. Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">4</a> sent over a fresh batch of addenda for his book. It
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">is</span> unfortunate—this delay through Wilson's illness;
                but Kennedy takes it very cheerily. He seems a fine impulsive fellow by his letters.
                In the last one he proposes that I should try some other schemes for getting the
                book afloat. We shall see. This evening Herbert Gilchrist<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">5</a> is
                coming down here to look through Kennedy's book, and something may suggest itself to
                us. We are going on afterwards to Costelloe's, as H.G. is anxious to know Mrs.
                C.,<a href="#n6109" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6109">6</a> who has been away in Surrey over Easter with her
                husband. I look forward with delight to seeing her again. She is truly a most noble
                and delightful nature. She is a little afraid perhaps of your deterministic theories
                (further elaborated by Doctor Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">7</a>) and non-moral apotheosis
                of evil; but that is natural enough. I, too, often doubt any absolute empire, even
                the most cosmic, over the human will: that is my feeling only, for I don't pretend
                to any philosophical complete creed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to hear of the great success of your Lincoln lecture.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">8</a> Would that I had
                been there to hear it. I should like to have come over with H. Gilchrist, but cannot
                manage to leave so soon. He will be with you I expect in the course of a few weeks
                more.</p>

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
