                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I like the big letter of May 25 the more I have read it—I think it will never
                die—I am glad the Rev Mr Chadwick<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> appears with his
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> letter to you to-day (as enclosed) for the fine
                chance it affords to ventilate the real account &amp; true inwardness of that
                Emerson talk on the Common in 1860—&amp; I at once send you the best synopsis
                of it I can recall—quite certainly the same in amount as I told you while it
                was fresh in my memory—the which with hasty scribblings on my relations with
                Emerson—I hope (working in as from yourself) you will incorporate in your
                answer to Tribune—</p>

            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">for head</p>
                <p class="tei_p">? <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">What were <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Emersons​ </span></span> relations to Walt Whitman?</span></p>
                <p class="tei_p">(for quoting entire in your letter if you think proper)</p>
                <p class="tei_p">"What made, and ever makes the argument of Emerson, in that walk on the Common,
                    so dear and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">holy to me, was the personal affectionateness</span>
                    of it, as of an elderly brother to a younger. It was a vehement, even passionate
                    well-wishing, which I felt then and feel to this hour the gratitude and
                    reverence of my life could never repay. Although perfect from an intellectual
                    and conventional point of view, it did not advance any thing I had not already
                    considered. And my arriere and citadel positions—such as I have indicated
                    in my June <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North American Review</span> memorandum<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—were not only not attacked, they were not even
                    alluded to.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">While I am on the subject, let me tell you I am sure the same process went on
                    with Emerson, in this particular (it was not needed any where else) that goes on
                    with many other of my readers. Certain am I that he too finally came to clearly
                    feel that the "Children of Adam" pieces were inevitable and consistent—and
                    in that sense, at least, proper—parts of the book. He was not the man to
                    retract any utterance: whatever it had been, it had expressed the truth of the
                    period.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">That he said some transient things, from 1863 to 1873, which are in the critical
                    direction and are acrid, (very likely your discussion will bring them out) there
                    is no doubt. But he permanently loved me, and believed in my poems, of which the
                    "Children of Adam" section, though difficult to unfold, is vertebral."</p>
                <p class="tei_p">William, I submit to you whether it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">wouldnt​ </span></span> be well, in your reply to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">quote all this</span>, as extracted from a late letter to you

                    (1840–1904), who termed himself a radical Unitarian, was the pastor of the
                    Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn from 1865 until his death. He was also a
                    reviewer for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Nation</span> and the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Book of Poems</span> (1876). In his reply to O'Connor in the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> of May 28, Chadwick averred that Emerson had
                    qualified his earlier praise of the poet. On <a href="loc.03043">May
                        29</a> O'Connor wrote to Whitman: "Of course I shall answer this clerical
                    blackguard, who has the audacity to accuse me of wilfully and consciously lying,
                    and I shall do my best to answer him with blasting effect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.41.html"> Tuesday, December 11, 1888</a>, 283). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00443_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00443_n3"><span>"A Memorandum at a
