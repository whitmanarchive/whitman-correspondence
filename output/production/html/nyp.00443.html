                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I like the big letter of May 25 the more I have read it—I think it will never
                die—I am glad the Rev Mr Chadwick appears with his
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> letter to you to-day (as enclosed) for the fine
                chance it affords to ventilate the real account &amp; true inwardness of that
                Emerson talk on the Common in 1860—&amp; I at once send you the best synopsis
                of it I can recall—quite certainly the same in amount as I told you while it
                was fresh in my memory—the which with hasty scribblings on my relations with
                Emerson—I hope (working in as from yourself) you will incorporate in your
                answer to Tribune—</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">for head</p>
                <p class="tei_p">? <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">What were <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Emersons​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Emerson's​
        
      </span></span> relations to Walt Whitman?</span></p>
                <p class="tei_p">(for quoting entire in your letter if you think proper)</p>
                <p class="tei_p">"What made, and ever makes the argument of Emerson, in that walk on the Common,
                    so dear and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">holy to me, was the personal affectionateness</span>
                    of it, as of an elderly brother to a younger. It was a vehement, even passionate
                    well-wishing, which I felt then and feel to this hour the gratitude and
                    reverence of my life could never repay. Although perfect from an intellectual
                    and conventional point of view, it did not advance any thing I had not already
                    considered. And my arriere and citadel positions—such as I have indicated
                    in my June <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North American Review</span> memorandum—were not only not attacked, they were not even
                    alluded to.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">While I am on the subject, let me tell you I am sure the same process went on
                    with Emerson, in this particular (it was not needed any where else) that goes on
                    with many other of my readers. Certain am I that he too finally came to clearly
                    feel that the "Children of Adam" pieces were inevitable and consistent—and
                    in that sense, at least, proper—parts of the book. He was not the man to
                    retract any utterance: whatever it had been, it had expressed the truth of the
                    period.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">That he said some transient things, from 1863 to 1873, which are in the critical
                    direction and are acrid, (very likely your discussion will bring them out) there
                    is no doubt. But he permanently loved me, and believed in my poems, of which the
                    "Children of Adam" section, though difficult to unfold, is vertebral."</p>
                <p class="tei_p">William, I submit to you whether it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">wouldnt​ </span><span class="tei_corr">wouldn't​

                    from me—</p>
