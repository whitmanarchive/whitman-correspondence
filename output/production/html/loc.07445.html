                    served as the managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span>.
                    Born in England, Nicholson graduated with honors from Christ College, Cambridge
                    before moving to New York in 1868. In New York, Nicholson and Albert D.
                    Richardson wrote a popular biography of Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant.
                    Through Richardson, an editorial staff member at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, Nicholson met then managing editor Whitelaw Reid, who worked
                    under editor Horace Greeley. Nicholson began work at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> as Reid's secretary, eventually becoming managing editor under
                    Reid when Reid succeeded Greeley as editor in 1872. Nicholson came into contact
                    with Whitman during Whitman's attempts to publish in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n0500">1. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0500 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0500"><span>Whitelaw Reid (1837–1912) 
                    was the editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span> from 1872 to 1905 
                    and also American ambassador to France (1889–1892) and England (1905–1912). He met
                    Whitman in the hospitals during the Civil War. Of his relations with the poet,
                    Reid later observed: "No one could fail then [during the War] to admire his zeal
                    and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard was for his character
                    rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The Leaves of Grass' period
                    that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered me completely." See
