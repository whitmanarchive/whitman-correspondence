                Very sorry to hear such bad accounts of the cold but trust it will soon be better,
                [/] wish you could have a good alcohol bath, real good sweat, would help you very
                much—can you not get some one in Camden to help you to arrange an alcohol
                bath—it is extremely simple. Willy Gurd still here, he
                goes East tomorrow morning, has the gas meter all
                constructed ("in his minds eye") already, will soon put it together when he gets
                alongside his lathe—all well here and nothing new. Ground still quite white
                with snow</p>
