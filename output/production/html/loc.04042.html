                    the top of a proof sheet entitled "Walt Whitman Last Night,"
                    which Whitman had obviously placed in type before he gave his lecture. Although
                    the letters are not extant, probably the poet sent similar notes to the editors
                    of the Chicago <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, the Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span>, and to the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span>.
                    There is the possibility that Whitman prepared this copy but did not send it. At
                    the bottom of the sheet Whitman appended a note: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">to
                        printer</span> dont mind the different type." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
