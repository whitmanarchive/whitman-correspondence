            <p class="tei_p">Have had a pretty bad day—ab't one of the real bad spells (except no really
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">definite</span> spell such as that special Monday)—but giving out the last 6 or 8
                hours most physical &amp; moral energy—no action at all of bowels or water
                works—no eating—have just risen and eaten three or four
                    mouthfuls—(Baker's strong advise)—am now
                sitting here in the chair (3.40 P M)—At this moment indicates rain
                shower—Y'r letter rec'd—I hope Eng. ed'n "Dem Vistas &amp;c" will come
                yet safely—it is the best specimen of typographic make &amp; binding (for
                modest expense) yet turned out there—Suppose you've got the further proofs to
                page 70—mail'd them yesterday—Shall have some little mendings, changings
                &amp;c. to plates.</p>

                uncomfortable—Horace Traubel has been in for a short
                visit, &amp; to bring the latest print proofs &amp;c:—All things go on &amp; I
                am satisfied so far (I have just paid him, Ferguson, $50)—have just swallowed a calomel powder preparatory to go to bed—we have
                had a slight rain—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">quiet</span> in comparison of the last three days &amp; nights
                is very helpful to me—</p>

                &amp;c. very fine—am sitting up quietly this moment—heavy rather <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dulness​ </span><span class="tei_corr">dullness​
