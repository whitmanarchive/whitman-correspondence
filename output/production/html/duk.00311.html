         <p class="tei_p">The enclosed letter from George<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I should have sent you before but have been so busy that I have neglected it  There is nothing particularly new at home with the exception that Mother is not well. She has been very unwell for the last few days. She has a very steady and severe pain, she thinks a gathering or enlargement, in the right side of her chest. For a day or two she was almost helpless. Night before last Mat made her a poultice of elm and it seems to have done her good. I can not get her to allow herself to be taken care of or to take care of herself. She has been very foolish in house cleaning, she has done more work—whitewashing and cleaning—than any man ought to have done. Yet all the talking that Mat and I could do was no avail. I am really fearful that she has permanently hurt herself. If she does not get better by tomorrow I shall have the doctor to see her  Its very provoking to have Mother kill herself so persistently. She is much worse I think than she used to be. She has an idea that she cannot afford to have anything hired. <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Im​ </span></span> in hopes that you will make and carry out the idea of coming to New York.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I cannot imagine what it is that ails mother.

         <p class="tei_p">In regard to the house I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">belive​ </span></span> its settled that we all stay as we are. I sent for Brown<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> to come up and see me the other evening. He said that if he had to pay more rent he would have to move. That he should like to stay but that he would move rather than pay more  I thought the matter all over—I did not want to take the whole house—I did not want to move—it would not make but a difference of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">abt​ </span></span> a $ per month so I told Brown he could stay and I would bear the increased rent. As it now stands it is as follows  Mother pays $85 per year, I pay $147 per year and Brown $168 per year. I took out an agreement for Mothers and my names at $19 33 per month</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did you get my letter enclosing $5 from Mr Lane.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Why do you not write me? is there any reason? I was in hopes that I would hear from you sometime ago.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote you to write me a letter to show Mr Worthen<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> of New York. I think we could get some money through him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mattie and the babies are quite well. The children are both growing finely  If Mother does not get better in a few days I will write you again</p>

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">September

                    Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and
                    Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for
                    publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money, contributed for
                    that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses
                    Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there)." Lane assisted Whitman in other ways
                    as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29,
                        1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so
                    solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April
                        3, 1863</a>, he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial
                    benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00311_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00311_n5"><span>See Thomas Jefferson

                    twenty dollars to Whitman on <a href="loc.00879">May 23, 1864</a>, and
                    expressed his hope "to send more from time to time." Whitman replied on May 24
                    (?), 1864, and wrote Worthen again two years later on December 20, 1866; both of
