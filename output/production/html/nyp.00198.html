               <span class="tei_salute">My dear William &amp; Nelly O'Connor,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I write a few lines to tell you how I find the folks at home—Both my mother &amp; brother George looked much better than I expected—Mother is quite well, considering—she goes about her household affairs pretty much the same as ever, &amp; is cheerful.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My brother would be in what I would almost call fair condition, if it were not that his legs are affected—it seems to me it is rheumatism, following the fever he had—but I don't know—He goes to bed quite sleepy &amp; falls to sleep—but then soon wakes, &amp; frequently little or no more sleep that night—he most always leaves the bed, &amp; comes downstairs, &amp; passes the night on the sofa. He goes out most every day though—some days has to lay by—He is going to report to Annapolis promptly when his furlough is up—I told him I had no doubt I could get it extended, but he does not wish it—He says little, but is in first rate spirits.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling finely—&amp; never enjoyed a visit home more than I am doing this.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I find myself perplexed about printing my book. All the printers tell me I could not pick a more inopportune time—that in ten days prices of paper, composition &amp;c will all be very much lower &amp;c. I shall decide tomorrow.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My brother Jeff wishes me to give you his sincerest thanks for your good will &amp;c in the matter of the engineer's situation—Mother says he has talked much about it, &amp; feels your kindness in it thoroughly.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Martha &amp; the little girls are well. My sister at Burlington Vt. is not well, &amp; mother will probably pay a long visit there this summer.</p>
