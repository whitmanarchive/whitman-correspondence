I wish you were nearer, that we might be together frequently.<a href="#n" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r">1</a> I do not associate much with the department clerks, yet many appear to be good fellows enough. The contest between Congress and the President is quite exciting. I go up to the Capitol and listen to the speeches and arguments.
