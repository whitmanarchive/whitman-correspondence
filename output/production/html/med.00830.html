            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to see by the Pall Mall Budget of yesterday that you are in fairly good
                health. Were I near you I should like to have the honor of paying my personal
                respects to you. I am your debtor. When a young man I read your Leaves of Grass 1855
                edition. It revealed a new world to me—the world within myself. Your Specimen
                Days<a href="#n4121" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4121">1</a> I regard as the most humane book of the present century.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">While breathing the spirit of freedom it bears no feeling of ill will against those
                who wished to keep chains on men because their skins were black.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I might say more, but enough to satisfy you that I have a real sympathy with your
                life's work, and that I regard your Leaves of Grass as being the most original of
                American books.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you would write your name upon my 1855 edition, which I intend to present to a
                public library, I should send it to you. I should like the book to represent your
                penmanship as well as your skill as a printer. Hoping you will be willing to render
                me this service, I am, dear Poet, yours truly,</p>
