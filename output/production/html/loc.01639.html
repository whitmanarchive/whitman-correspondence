            <p class="tei_p">Both your letters came this week—also one from my friend Eldridge, he too
                speaks of meeting &amp; talking with you.—It is real winter here, the ground all
                covered with snow, as I look out—not the least thaw to-day, as it is
                cloudy—I rise pretty late mornings—had my breakfast a little
                while ago, mutton-chop, coffee, nice brown bread &amp; sweet butter, very
                nice—eat with very fair appetite—I enjoy my breakfast better than any
                other meal—(eat a light dinner pretty late, &amp; no supper)—Feel
                generally about the same as before described—no worse, no better, (nothing to
                brag of anyhow)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have mentioned about my crossing the ferry—from our house, the cars run by
                the next corner, (200 feet, or less,) a half mile or so to the ferry—the
                Delaware here is full three quarters of a mile wide—it is a noble river, not
                so wide as the Potomac, nor with the fine banks like Arlington, but grander, &amp;
                with more style, &amp; with powerful, rushing tides, now great processions of broken
                ice, many little &amp; some great big cakes—the boats are very fine &amp;
                strong, go crashing right ahead, with a loud noise, breaking the cakes often a foot
                thick &amp; more—I enjoy crossing these days—it does me good—the
                ferrymen are all very kind &amp; respectful—</p>

                it much—There is an awful amount of want &amp; suffering, from no work,

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
