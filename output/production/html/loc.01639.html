                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Both your letters came this week—also one from my friend Eldridge, he too
                speaks of meeting &amp; talking with you.—It is real winter here, the ground all
                covered with snow, as I look out—not the least thaw to-day, as it is
                cloudy—I rise pretty late mornings—had my breakfast a little
                while ago, mutton-chop, coffee, nice brown bread &amp; sweet butter, very
                nice—eat with very fair appetite—I enjoy my breakfast better than any
                other meal—(eat a light dinner pretty late, &amp; no supper)—Feel
                generally about the same as before described—no worse, no better, (nothing to
                brag of anyhow)</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01639.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01639.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01639.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have mentioned about my crossing the ferry—from our house, the cars run by
                the next corner, (200 feet, or less,) a half mile or so to the ferry—the
                Delaware here is full three quarters of a mile wide—it is a noble river, not
                so wide as the Potomac, nor with the fine banks like Arlington, but grander, &amp;
                with more style, &amp; with powerful, rushing tides, now great processions of broken
                ice, many little &amp; some great big cakes—the boats are very fine &amp;
                strong, go crashing right ahead, with a loud noise, breaking the cakes often a foot
                thick &amp; more—I enjoy crossing these days—it does me good—the
                ferrymen are all very kind &amp; respectful—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I have been reading a book "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Merrie England in the Olden
                    Time</span>," a London book, with pictures, full of fun &amp; humor—I have enjoyed
                it much—There is an awful amount of want &amp; suffering, from no work,
                hereabout—a young man was here yesterday—had seen me in
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash</span>​ —wanted help—I gave him a little—I see the cars &amp;
                locomotive skurrying by as I close. </p>
