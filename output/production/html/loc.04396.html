            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">A splendid morning again—blue cloudless sky, bright sunshine, clear atmosphere,
                &amp; the air cool but tonic &amp; bracing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And here I am at Fenelon Falls!—"What made you come into <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this</span>
                wilderness?" a stranger asked me yesterday. To which the answer was that I came here for
                a friend's sake.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My dear old friend, Fred Wild! 
                We are very different in many—perhaps in most respects. May be it is
                in good part for that very reason that we have been affectionate friends 
                ever since we were at school together.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00978_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00978_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00978_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                Poor Fred! Things have gone roughly with him in many ways—but he preserves his fresh jollity
                &amp; mirthfulness, &amp; his warm affections. &amp; is one of those frank, unaffected, careless
                fellows whom most people like at once. What affectations he has are rather of the defiant kind—would
                rather one thought him worse than he really is than better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When he was 20 he came out to Canada, &amp; visited a friend of his father's near here. 
                Then he got some work to do in this place—at a shingle mill—&amp; 
                lived here for some months, supporting himself.
                He had no intention of staying here, but set himself to see 
                what he could do in a new country where his
                previous training was of next to no use to him, 
                &amp;, above all, to taste the luxury of manly independence
                &amp; self reliance.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00979_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00979_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00979_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span></p>
            <p class="tei_p"> He became very friendly with a young farmer here—Tom Rutherford—
                &amp; during the 16 years since
                his return has corresponded with him regularly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last year he revisited the old place, &amp; had a good time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I arrived at Fenelon Falls about 4 o'clock yesterday. Tom Rutherford 
                met me at the station &amp; received 
                me with a cordiality &amp; evident delight that touched me deeply. 
                He invited me out to his farm—5
                miles away—but I decided to stay here a day—so 
                it is arranged that he comes for me between 12
                &amp; 2—that I stay all night with him, 
                &amp; then go tomorrow by boat to a place called Bobcaygeon—returning
                here at night, &amp; leaving here again on Friday evening.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It would have done you good to see the introductions I got, &amp; the

                welcomes I got as "Fred Wild's friend." It did <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span> good anyway, 
                &amp; I was delighted to find 
                how affectionately he is thought of here.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At the post office were two letters from Chas. Stewart—an 
                elderly gentleman at <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Haliburton</span> where
                I go next—very cordial &amp; kind. One begins</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"Yours of the 23<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rd</span> to hand. 
                It will always be to me a real, genuine, out-and-out, 
                a yard-wide &amp; all-wool,—pleasure
                to meet any friend of Fred Wild's. So come along."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just finished a long letter to Fred telling him all the news, 
                &amp; am both tired of writing &amp; impatient
                to get out &amp; look round. But it pleases me to tell
