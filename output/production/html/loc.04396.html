            <p class="tei_p">A splendid morning again—blue cloudless sky, bright sunshine, clear atmosphere,
                &amp; the air cool but tonic &amp; bracing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And here I am at Fenelon Falls!<a href="#n2b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2b">2</a>—"What made you come into <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this</span>
                wilderness?" a stranger asked me yesterday. To which the answer was that I came here for
                a friend's sake.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My dear old friend, Fred Wild!<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> 
                We are very different in many—perhaps in most respects. May be it is
                in good part for that very reason that we have been affectionate friends 
                ever since we were at school together.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00978_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00978_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00978_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00978_large.jpg</span>
                Poor Fred! Things have gone roughly with him in many ways—but he preserves his fresh jollity
                &amp; mirthfulness, &amp; his warm affections. &amp; is one of those frank, unaffected, careless
                fellows whom most people like at once. What affectations he has are rather of the defiant kind—would
                rather one thought him worse than he really is than better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When he was 20 he came out to Canada, &amp; visited a friend of his father's near here. 
                Then he got some work to do in this place—at a shingle mill—&amp; 
                lived here for some months, supporting himself.
                He had no intention of staying here, but set himself to see 
                what he could do in a new country where his
                previous training was of next to no use to him, 
                &amp;, above all, to taste the luxury of manly independence
                &amp; self reliance.

                his return has corresponded with him regularly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last year he revisited the old place, &amp; had a good time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I arrived at Fenelon Falls about 4 o'clock yesterday. Tom Rutherford 
                met me at the station &amp; received 
                me with a cordiality &amp; evident delight that touched me deeply. 
                He invited me out to his farm—5
                miles away—but I decided to stay here a day—so 
                it is arranged that he comes for me between 12
                &amp; 2—that I stay all night with him, 
                &amp; then go tomorrow by boat to a place called Bobcaygeon—returning
                here at night, &amp; leaving here again on Friday evening.</p>
