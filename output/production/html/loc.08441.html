            <p class="tei_p"> Y'rs of 23d rec'd—many thanks for the invitation,
                &amp; affectionate regards to you &amp; to Messrs: Jefferson
                &amp; Florence—But I am too dilapidated, &amp; cannot
                think of trying to come over.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If you see Frank Carpenter tell him I am willing to sit
                for the picture, wh' is all I can do—&amp; I send him my best
                compliments—am sitting here now in great arm chair with wolf-skin spread
                over back for warmth—cannot get across the room (f'm paralysis)—but
                fair spirits—just had a pleasant call f'm Jeannette Gilder N Y. &amp; some charming girls—</p>
