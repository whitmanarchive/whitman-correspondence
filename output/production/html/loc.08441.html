                    (1841–1899) was a noted journalist in Philadelphia, New York, and
                    Washington, D. C. A Pennsylvania native, he began writing at the Philadelphia
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> at age seventeen and was named a managing
                    editor in 1862. After serving as a war journalist during the Civil War, he moved
                    to New York in 1865 to work at the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>,
                    which he edited from 1866 to 1868. In 1870 he established his own newspaper, the
                    New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Standard</span>. In 1877, he was invited to accompany
                    President Ulysses S. Grant on a world tour; Young published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Around the World with General Grant</span>, a two-volume account of the tour,
                    in 1879. Young's knowledge of the Chinese language earned him the position of
                    the American ambassador to China from 1882 to 1885. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08441_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="loc.08441_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:
