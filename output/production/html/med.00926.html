                        Edwin Haviland Miller derives his transcription from a facsimile
                        of the letter published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Review</span>, v (1959), 11.</span>

                    was a translator and poet from France who commented positively not only on
                    Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
                    apparently liked the critic's work on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                    Grass</span>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
                    twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:
