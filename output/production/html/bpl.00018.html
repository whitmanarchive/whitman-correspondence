                    was on the staff of the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>. Apparently he met
                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
                    in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
                    the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

He was altogether
                    'too previous' and hardly appreciated what he had undertaken. He did not know
                    how to go to work and appointed officers of a society which had not been
                    organized! We all had to sit down on him and the matter is in abeyance."
                    According to Hartmann's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Conversations with Walt Whitman</span>
                    (1895), the officers were to be Bucke as president, Kennedy as vice-president,
                    and "Your humble servant" as director (36). For Walt Whitman's reaction, see

                    1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
                    form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
                    with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
                    was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
