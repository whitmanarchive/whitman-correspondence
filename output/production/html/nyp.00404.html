                    1877. Burroughs noted the "great event" in his journal on March 21: "[Walt
                    Whitman and Harry Stafford] cut up like two boys and annoyed me sometimes. Great
                    tribulation in the kitchen in the morning. Can't get them up to breakfast in
                    time. Walt takes Harry with him as a kind of foil or refuge from the

                        1876</a>, Whitman had agreed to sit for a portrait by noted landscape
                    painter G. W. Waters. Burroughs, understandably, was not fond of the painting:
                    "It gives Walt's benevolent look, but not his power—his elemental look. It
                    makes him look rather soft, like a sort of Benjamin Franklin" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston, New York:
                    Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 164). The portrait appears as the frontispiece to the
                    fifth volume of the Camden Edition. Waters' sketch also idealizes the poet (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span>, ed. Richard Bucke,
