                    physician and a graduate of the University of New York. In addition to his medical practice,
                    he wrote several literary works, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dion, A Tragedy: and Poems</span> (1877) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Maud Vivian: A Drama, and Poems</span> (1873). In 1893, Rew was accused and convicted
                of illegally conducting a so-called medical prepatory college at the 99 Macdougal Street address that
                appears on this letter. Rew issued false medical diplomas for a fee to individuals who studied with
                him for a couple of weeks; the "diplomas" supposedly certified the recipients to practice in the Western States ("Made M.D.'s in Two Weeks," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                Evening World</span> [July 25, 1893], 3). He served three months in prison for the diploma scandal, and three years later,
                he was arrested again on charges of bigamy as he had married at least five women and swindled some of them out of
                their savings ("Had Five Wives," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Post</span> [October 29, 1896], 5). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n3">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03634_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03634_n3"><span>Rew is referencing the preface of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03634_n2 tei_note_type_editorail tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.03634_n2"><span>The phrase "Tui Moriamus te salutamus"
