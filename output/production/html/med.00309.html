            <p class="tei_p">. . . I believe I have told you all that occurs to me, only I must let you know that your notion I may have forgotten you is not regular by a long shot. I do not forget any one so easily, where the friendship has been formed as it was under such circumstances as yours &amp; mine in the hospital. You must write to me whenever you feel like it—tell me all about things &amp; people down there in Kentucky—God bless you, my loving soldier boy, &amp; for the present, Farewell.</p>

                    Whitman's letters to an unidentified ex-soldier were printed by Florence
                    Hardiman Miller in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Overland Monthly</span>. According to
                    Edward Havilland Miller, most of the letters have not been dated because of the
                    fragmentary nature of her quotations, and the identity of the recipient is also
                    unknown. Evidently he came from Kentucky and later moved to California. Florence
                    Miller's transcripts are not reliable, as evidenced by a comparison of the
                    facsimile (63) with the transcription
                    (61).
                    Miss Miller, who generally is more exuberant than factual, seems to imply that
                    the correspondence continued into the early 1870s. Until the originals are
                    found, this attempt at reconstruction will have to suffice; see Whitman's
                    letters to soldiers from <a href="med.00314">1865(?)</a>
                    , <a href="loc.00844">early 1866(?)</a>
                    , <a href="med.00315">May 16, 1866</a>
                    , and <a href="med.00317">November (?) 1866</a>
