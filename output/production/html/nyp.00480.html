                    leaving Washington for Providence, R. I., because of the illness of his
                    daughter. It is an interesting sidelight on the relations of O'Connor and
                    Whitman that after the resumption of their correspondence in 1882 almost a year
                    passed before O'Connor referred to his family or Whitman inquired about Mrs.
                    O'Connor and Jeannie. Until the quarrel Whitman was on intimate terms with the
                    family; in fact, Mrs. O'Connor continued to write to him for four years after
                    the estrangement. Despite Jeannie's critical illness the poet referred to her
                    only in this letter and in his letter to O'Connor of <a href="nyp.00481">March 14, 1883</a>. O'Connor mentioned her death on May 23 (Oscar Lion
                    Collection, New York Public Library). In 1888 Whitman observed: "Jeannie's death
                    was the tragedy of their history—and a tragedy in my history, too. Too
                    much must not be said of that or the like of that—it gets down in you
                    where words do not go." Horace Traubel reported that Whitman's "eyes were full
                    of tears" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York:
                    Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:261). Yet Whitman apparently did not write to
                    O'Connor about her death or record it in his Commonplace Book (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
