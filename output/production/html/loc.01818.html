         <p class="tei_p">I have been constantly hoping to have you here again and now begin to see something more
            than a glimmer of fruition. Ashton<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> has spoken (at my
            instigation) to Mr Otto<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> the Assistant Secretary of the
            Department of the Interior in your behalf, and Mr Otto says that if you will write a
            letter of application to the Secretary of the Interior, he will endeavor to put you
               in.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>
         <p class="tei_p">Now, dear Walt, do this without delay. The object of your writing the letter is to get a
            specimen of your hand. Pick out, then, a good pen and write as fairly as you can a
            letter formally applying for a clerkship. Then enclose a copy of this <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03021.002.jpg</span>letter to Ashton, so that he
            can follow it in to the Secretary. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> letter you will,
            of course, mail to the Secretary direct.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Do this as soon as you can. We shall fetch it this time. I have every confidence that
            you will get a good and an easy berth, a regular income, &amp;c, leaving you time to
            attend to the soldiers, to your poems, &amp;c,—in a word, what Archimedes wanted,
            a place on which to rest the lever.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I shall wait anxiously to hear that you have sent on the letters. I have been thinking
            of you constantly for months and have been doing everything I could to secure you a
            foothold here. For a long time, deceived (I must think) by Swinton's<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> pretensions to influence and by his profuse promises, I hoped
            to get you either one of the New York State Agency <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03021.003.jpg</span>Assistantships or the place of an Assistant
            Librarian in the Congress Library (the latter would be really a sinecure if the right
            one was got).<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> But who follows Swinton follows a
            will-of-the-wisp and though I followed him remorselessly, every blessed day for several
            weeks, and gave him neither rest nor peace, as the saying is, I got nothing except
            promises. Since I gave him up, I have been badgering Ashton, who is a man of another
            sort, as what he has done shows. The difficulty was to get the right thing. He secured
            me some little time ago a place in the Post Office for you, but I declined it, because I
            thought it was not the proper place for you. I think a desk in the Interior would be
            first rate.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I told Ashton there was nothing I would not do for him if he would carry this affair to
            a safe conclusion. He has been very <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03021.004.jpg</span>good and anxious in your behalf.

            own office if a vacancy had occurred as expected.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Don't forget to do as I tell you immediately.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I never answered your letter of September 11th, but, dear Walt, I always think of you,
            though I write so seldom and so badly. You are never forgotten. I read your poems often,
            I get their meaning more and more, I stand up for them and you, I expound, define,
            defend, vindicate, justify them and you with all the heart and head I have whenever
            occasion demands.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I got the Times with your long letter about the Hospital experiences, which I read with
            a swelling heart and wet eyes. It was very great and touching to me. I think I could
            mount the tribune for you on that and speak <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03021.005.jpg</span>speech which jets fire and drops tears. Only
            it filled me with infinite regrets that there is not a book from you, embodying these
            rich and sad experiences. It would be sure of immortality. No history of our times would
            ever be written without it, if written with that wealth of living details you could
            crowd into it. Indeed, it would itself be history.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I saw your letter about the prisoners. It was as just as powerful. I have been hearing
            for a fortnight past that it is the Secretary of War's "policy" which prevents exchange,
            and if this is true, I pray from my heart of hearts that it never may be forgotten
            against him. Reddest murder is white to an act like this and its folly is equal to its
            crime. It would <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03021.006.jpg</span>be a

         <p class="tei_p">I write this letter at intervals between the press of office work, which has driven upon
            me in spasms today, but pretty severely when it did come. Any incoherences in it, you
            may refer to the obfusticated state which such hurryings have induced in me.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Farewell, dear Walt. I hope to hear from you very soon. We are all tolerably well at

                    William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
                    Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
                    William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
                    various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
                    government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E.

Hubley Ashton, the
                    assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Whitman's affairs,
                    and obtained a position for the poet in his office after Whitman lost his job in
                    the Department of the Interior. James Harlan (1820–1899), Secretary of the
                    Interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed Whitman from his second-class clerkship on
                        <a href="nyp.00222">June 30, 1865</a>. Harlan apparently took offense
                    at the copy of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> which Whitman was
                    revising and which he kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Ashton,
                    Whitman secured a position in the Attorney General's office. The Harlan episode
                    led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." for more on Whitman and Ashton, see Amy M.
