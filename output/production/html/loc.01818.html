            <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I have been constantly hoping to have you here again and now begin to see something more
            than a glimmer of fruition. Ashton has spoken (at my
            instigation) to Mr Otto the Assistant Secretary of the
            Department of the Interior in your behalf, and Mr Otto says that if you will write a
            letter of application to the Secretary of the Interior, he will endeavor to put you
               in.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Now, dear Walt, do this without delay. The object of your writing the letter is to get a
            specimen of your hand. Pick out, then, a good pen and write as fairly as you can a
            letter formally applying for a clerkship. Then enclose a copy of this <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>letter to Ashton, so that he
            can follow it in to the Secretary. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> letter you will,
            of course, mail to the Secretary direct.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Do this as soon as you can. We shall fetch it this time. I have every confidence that
            you will get a good and an easy berth, a regular income, &amp;c, leaving you time to
            attend to the soldiers, to your poems, &amp;c,—in a word, what Archimedes wanted,
            a place on which to rest the lever.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I shall wait anxiously to hear that you have sent on the letters. I have been thinking
            of you constantly for months and have been doing everything I could to secure you a
            foothold here. For a long time, deceived (I must think) by Swinton's pretensions to influence and by his profuse promises, I hoped
            to get you either one of the New York State Agency <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>Assistantships or the place of an Assistant
            Librarian in the Congress Library (the latter would be really a sinecure if the right
            one was got). But who follows Swinton follows a
            will-of-the-wisp and though I followed him remorselessly, every blessed day for several
            weeks, and gave him neither rest nor peace, as the saying is, I got nothing except
            promises. Since I gave him up, I have been badgering Ashton, who is a man of another
            sort, as what he has done shows. The difficulty was to get the right thing. He secured
            me some little time ago a place in the Post Office for you, but I declined it, because I
            thought it was not the proper place for you. I think a desk in the Interior would be
            first rate.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I told Ashton there was nothing I would not do for him if he would carry this affair to
            a safe conclusion. He has been very <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>good and anxious in your behalf. He would have given you a desk in his
            own office if a vacancy had occurred as expected.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Don't forget to do as I tell you immediately.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I never answered your letter of September 11th, but, dear Walt, I always think of you,
            though I write so seldom and so badly. You are never forgotten. I read your poems often,
            I get their meaning more and more, I stand up for them and you, I expound, define,
            defend, vindicate, justify them and you with all the heart and head I have whenever
            occasion demands.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I got the Times with your long letter about the Hospital experiences, which I read with
            a swelling heart and wet eyes. It was very great and touching to me. I think I could
            mount the tribune for you on that and speak <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>speech which jets fire and drops tears. Only
            it filled me with infinite regrets that there is not a book from you, embodying these
            rich and sad experiences. It would be sure of immortality. No history of our times would
            ever be written without it, if written with that wealth of living details you could
            crowd into it. Indeed, it would itself be history.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I saw your letter about the prisoners. It was as just as powerful. I have been hearing
            for a fortnight past that it is the Secretary of War's "policy" which prevents exchange,
            and if this is true, I pray from my heart of hearts that it never may be forgotten
            against him. Reddest murder is white to an act like this and its folly is equal to its
            crime. It would <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>be a
            demonism of another kind indeed than the Southerners', yet as bad, perhaps worse,
            because sprung from calculation rather than hatred.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Such things make one sicken of the world.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I write this letter at intervals between the press of office work, which has driven upon
            me in spasms today, but pretty severely when it did come. Any incoherences in it, you
            may refer to the obfusticated state which such hurryings have induced in me.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Farewell, dear Walt. I hope to hear from you very soon. We are all tolerably well at
            home. Eldridge comes every evening. We often talk of you. On
            Christmas, you were wanted to make the dinner at home perfect. We all spoke of you. On
            Thanksgiving <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03021.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03021.007.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>it was the
            same. At dinner that day, I said "I wish"—and stopped. "What?"—said
               Nelly. "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> know," chirped little
            Jeannie, "he wishes Walt was here." Which was true—that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">was</span> the unuttered wish.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Let me hear soon.</p>
