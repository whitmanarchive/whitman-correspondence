                    (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
                    with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
                    often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
                    Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
