            <p class="tei_p">I have had a pretty good week so far—am either throwing off (or easying) some of the worst bad subjections and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grips</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My big book (collection of all) is all printed, &amp; paid for &amp; at the binders delaying for one or two little things—it is nothing more than 
                you have seen—but I had a great desire for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> to be combined, comprehended at one glance—and here it is—of course I shall
                send you a copy—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting yet in my sick room now in my usual big chair by the oak wood fire, &amp; alone. I have plenty visitors enough &amp; good ones—my appetite
                &amp; sleep are fair—I have a new helper &amp; nurse, a clean strong kind hearted young Kanuck man Dr. Bucke sent me—All indeed goes as well &amp; 
                 comfortable as could be expected with me—And how with you? I think of you every day—&amp; most all my friends coming here ask ab't you—I rec'd the letter 
                 last week &amp; thankful &amp; ask for more—I cannot say I enthuse on H[arrison]'s election—but I accept it—all right for what it goes—Dr. B. is probably
                 coming this way in a week—Best love to you &amp; to Nelly.</p>
