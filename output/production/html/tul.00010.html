                    journalist and friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the
                    Civil War. Swinton, managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                    Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman.
                    Whitman's correspondence with Swinton began on <a href="bos.00006">February
                        23, 1863</a>. Swinton's enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On <a href="loc.01955">September 25, 1868</a>, Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly
                    impressed with the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you.
                    I read this afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never
                    before read. I could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more
                    to me than all other books and poetry." On <a href="loc.01957">June 23,
                        1874</a>, Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter":
                    "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the
                    'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street,
                    Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something
                    that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me,
                    grown around me, and grown into me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
                    36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
                    for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the
                    weekly labor journal, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Swinton's Paper</span>. When this
                    publication folded, he returned to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. See Robert
