                his copy, &amp; it comes to my soul over the dozen years more eloquent &amp;
                beautiful than ever—seems to me, (as a passionate shooting shaft launched into
                those times, &amp; indeed fitting to the whole situation then &amp; since)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">it deserves to stand just as it is</span>—two passages in the
                last page only might be left out, &amp; I should so suggest.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Seems to me all that is wanted is a brief preparatory

                    to delete the passages mentioned, he was in a "dilemma," since they were singled
                    out for censure by his critics when the pamphlet appeared in 1866. For this
                    reason he thought no deletions should be made (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906],
