            <p class="tei_p">You will get a copious shower (Dr B[ucke] and me together) of these pestering
                messages. I have been looking through the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] as Dr B sent it in
                his copy, &amp; it comes to my soul over the dozen years more eloquent &amp;
                beautiful than ever—seems to me, (as a passionate shooting shaft launched into
                those times, &amp; indeed fitting to the whole situation then &amp; since)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">it deserves to stand just as it is</span>—two passages in the
                last page only might be left out, &amp; I should so suggest. Seems to me all that is wanted is a brief preparatory
                ¶ dated present time, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">distinctly confirming your faith
                    &amp;c</span>. that it is without diminution (it couldn't have "increase")—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tomorrow &amp; next day the
                    printers will be waiting for the copy</span>. It is intended to put the copy,
                whole book, in hand in force, &amp; have it out soon—Send to me
                here—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am pretty well this ending winter. Yes I rec'd the big Powell <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ethnology</span> &amp; have made more than one <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">courageous</span> attack on it (thought I acknowledged it)—The
                air here (human &amp; other) all nervous from the pouring crowds of big disasters,
                floods, mine cavings, deaths, wrecks, big casualties from every quarter—</p>
