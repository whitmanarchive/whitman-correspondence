                    Whitman on <a href="loc.05603">April 10</a>: "We have laid before the
                    District Attorney the alterations proposed by you. They are not satisfactory. .
                    . . As we said at the outset we do not wish to go into court in connection with
                    this case. Therefore as your views seem to be irreconcilable with those of the
                    official authorities there seems no alternative for us but to decline to further
                    circulate the book. We should be open to any reasonable arrangement for turning
                    the plates over to you." On <a href="loc.05566">April 13</a> the publisher
                    informed Whitman that the royalty due him was $405.50 and that the cost of
                    the plates was $475. In return for a receipt for the royalty, the firm was
                    willing to turn over to Whitman the plates, the steel portrait and 225 copies of
                    the book in sheets. As Whitman did not reply, the firm wrote again on <a href="loc.05108">May 4</a>. The poet arranged better terms in the final
                    settlement (see the letter from Whitman to Osgood &amp; Company of <a href="loc.00533">May 23, 1882</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
