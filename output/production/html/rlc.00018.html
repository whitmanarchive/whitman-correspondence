            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of Nov: 27 rec'd. Console yourself for suffering f'm rheumatism—for it
                might be paralysis—I still keep around—am much more comfortable than
                four years ago, but am very lame &amp; clumsy, (yet red and stout)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Bjornson did not come to see me—America you know is
                a big country, &amp; he had many places to go to—I think Clemens Petersen is still some where in this country—very likely
                doing well—the last time I saw him he came up to me (personally looked well)
                in New York, between two &amp; three years ago, in a crowd, &amp; only a few
                words—he is a quite well known literary person &amp; if he had died or any
                thing happened, I should have heard of it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I too mourn the death of Elster—though unknown I
                had formed a liking for him—I shall forward one of my books to
                    Thorsteinsson—Dr Bucke's book will not be published for some months—perhaps a
                year—I send you, same mail with this, a copy of my new edition—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I write it is Sunday, just before sunset—&amp; we have had a fine
                day—indeed a fine mild winter so far—have been in my room all day,
                writing &amp;c, very comfortable—shall now walk to the post office, &amp;
                probably sail once or twice across the river, the Delaware here, a mile
                wide—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The London publisher &amp; agent for my new edition is David Bogue, St Martin's
                Place, Trafalgar Square—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have heard that my book is to be translated into German, by some friends in
                    Dresden—also into Russian by some Russian
                exiles &amp; a Mr Lee a Russ-English scholar—I
                have been written to about both propositions &amp; of course have expressed warmest
                assent—So good bye, my dear friend—&amp; affectionate wishes to you
                &amp; yours—</p>
