            <p class="tei_p">Lots of inquiries &amp; prayers &amp; good wishes ab't you come to me (&amp; I hear of) that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span>
                never hear of. I rec'd Nelly's two brief cards over two weeks ago—but hunger for
                more frequent &amp; fuller information—Hear from Dr B[ucke] &amp; Kennedy often &amp; from John
                B[urroughs] at long intervals—K's book has not yet begun the printing but is to
                be—is settled. All my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> bits will be included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> &amp; I will send
                an early proof of all to you—As I write I am sitting here in my big chair by the
                window (I have open'd it a few moments—it is near sunset—air a little tart)—I am
                quite <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immobile</span> &amp; don't get out except by being <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">toted</span>—a bunch of white lilies is in
                the window &amp; my bird is singing like a house afire—</p>
