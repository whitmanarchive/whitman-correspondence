                        March 7, 1865. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter March 7, and
                        Richard Maurice Bucke later supplied the year 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller,
                        however, dated the letter to 1863 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence,
                            1842–67</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                        1:372). If not an error in his calendar of letters, Miller may have dated
                        Louisa's letter to 1863 because an article by Walt appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> and because Walt asked Louisa to
                        retrieve copies of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> that
                        year. An article by Whitman appeared in both publications in March 1863:
                            "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/journalism/tei/per.00196">Exemption from Military Service</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                            Times</span>, March 15, 1863, and "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/journalism/tei/per.00210">The Great Washington Hospitals</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily
                            Eagle</span>, March 19, 1863. However, Louisa specifically states that the
                        article appeared in the "times yesterday" and dates her letter "March 7."
                        1865 is correct year because an article by Walt Whitman appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> the previous day (<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/journalism/tei/per.00203.html">"The Soldiers,"</a>
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, March 6, 1865). Additional
                        corroboration is provided by a remark about a sketch made by Samuel H. Sims
                        (see Walt Whitman's <a href="med.00308">March 13, 1865</a> letter to

                    Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of their uncle
                    Walt. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had informed Walt Whitman on <a href="duk.00435">March 5, 1865</a> that "sis is not well yet she seems
                    to have A kind of fever." The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but
                    was passed to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."
                    The letter dates to 1865, so "Sis" is Jessie Louisa. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00434_n9 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00434_n9"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    30, 1864 of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia (see George's <a href="duk.00359">August 9, 1864</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor

                    As it turned out, George only suffered a minor injury: "I have come out safe and
