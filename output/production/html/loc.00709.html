                     To Messrs. Beach, of the Sun: (through Mr.
                    Stuart.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">1</a>) </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> The accompanying novel, of "The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Sleeptalker</span>," I consider
                one of the most interesting, romantic, and full of incident, of any I have ever come
                across.—It is by the Danish novelist Ingemann,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> a better writer even than Miss
                Bremer.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The work from which I have compiled "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the Sleeptalker</span>" is
                an English translation, (I send you the cover and title page,) whose only fault
                    <del>it</del> was, that it was too voluminous, the author going very extensively
                into the details of old Danish history.—This I have altogether cut out;
                reducing the work to half its first size.—It has never been republished in
                this country, and is altogether unknown here.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The romance is a stirring and lively one, and it seems to me fitted to become very
                popular.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I take the liberty of leaving it for you to look at, to see if I could dispose of it
                for serial publication in "The Sun."—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I desire but a moderate price.—After running through the Sun, it seems to me
                it would pay handsomely to print it in a neat 25 cent book form.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> You will see that the title of the original is "The childhood of Erik Menved"; the
                latter part of the <span class="tei_add tei_add_place_above">original</span> story, consisting very much of
                    prolicprolix detail of historical events, gives it that
                name—but that part of the story I have contracted into a few paragraphs—and have taken a singular trait of one of the principal actors in the
                narrative as the foundation of the name I give it.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Please, if convenient, make up your minds whether it would suit you, and how much it
                would be worth to you, so that I can have an answer by the middle or latter part of
                the week.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The story would make about 65 leaded <span class="tei_add tei_add_place_above">short</span> columns of the
                Sun—so that, at an average of 3 columns a day it would run through 22 days.—</p>
