                get a translation of it published in one of our papers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Immediately after my return from Germany (28<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> February) I did write to you<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> and

                one, that ever has been taken. Write to Mrs Clausen, if they have not forwarded it to you.</p>

                a great charm to me, though I never liked him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If my thoughts did not weaken and wither, when I try to give them expression in the English language, I should 
                on some sheets give you a due description of our political and literary doings. Although the word of Hamlet: 
                there is something rotten in the state of Denmark, still are true, I have the greatest belief of the vitality 
                of my people and the other Scandinavian peoples. We have been living here in the outskirts of civilization; we 
                have been endowed with its gifts, but we <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">have have​ </span></span> not been poisoned 
                with its venom. Ours is the future in Europe, small as we are.</p>

                viewing the things shall be more sure to touch the chord of the native mind as here and in Norway. We are made 
                of the true democratic stuff, we have not the venomous passions, but we have the high ideal aspiration. A peasant 
                on Fijen (one of our fertile isles) wrote to me in the spring for two years ago to thank me for my article on you. 
                Peasants are on the sundays holding the numbers of "for Ide og Virkelighed"<a href="#n0239" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0239">11</a> 
                in their <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_illegible tei_supplied_source_traubel tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_km">hard fists</span> 
                and read every word, though the matters often are very difficult.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But on the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">political</span> arena our democratic leaders are dull and narrowminded persons, 
                to say nothing worse. None of them has named your book yet, most probably they won't name it at all. It is your 
                (political) adversaries, who write criticisms on you. But your adversaries are mostly your friends, they have 
                themselves a democratic mind and grant you much more than the editors of the American magazines. But your best 
                friends are the women. A young Baroness <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_km">Fraupe</span><a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">12</a> 
                has read your books with true enthusiasm. The women have understood, that the ordinary criticisms can as easily 
                be applied on a nature like yours as the process of hair cutting and shaving on a mountain forest.

                    Hegelian philosopher and contemporary of Søren Kierkegaard (1813–1855). In
                    1870, Nielsen published his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philosophy of Religion</span>, in
                    which he argued (against the Hegelian model) that religious faith and scientific
                    knowledge were not mutually exclusive categories, permitting faith in Christian
                    dogma to exist simultaneously with scientific advances. </span></span> [<a href="#r0443">back</a>]</li><li id="n14">15. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00621_n14 note" id="duk.00621_n14"><span>In January 1873, Whitman
                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in
                    his <a href="yal.00260">January 26, 1873</a>, letter to his mother, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office. See also his <a href="med.00418">March 21, 1873</a>, letter to his mother. </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li></ul>
