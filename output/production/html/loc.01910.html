                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of the 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> I received this morning. 
                The number of Harper's magazine and of the New York Tribune
                did <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> follow, but most probably they will reach me; printed matter is very 
                often going an other way. If your "Prayer of Columbus" be not too long, I shall try to
                get a translation of it published in one of our papers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Immediately after my return from Germany (28<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> February) I did write to you and
                sent you a long article of your book in the paper "Fædrelandet" (fatherland);
                the last monday I for mailed for you another article in the weekly paper "Nær og Fjern" (Near and 
                Far). All these things have been sent to New Jersey. To the Treasury in Washington have been sent in all <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">three</span> 
                copies of "Demokratiske Fremblik," one in loose sheets (franked), one complete paper
                bound copy franked and an other unpaid (for greater safety, as unpaid letters and papers never fail their man). 
                Some copies of "Illustreret Fædrelandet" (peoples illustrated magazine) with 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01910.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01910.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01910.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                your portrait and some short biographical notices have also been sent to Washington.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With Clausen I sent you in the autumn 1872 a large portrait of mine, the only resembling 
                one, that ever has been taken. Write to Mrs Clausen, if they have not forwarded it to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you could, without troubling yourself too much, send me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> the pieces of Clemens 
                Petersen, that come to your eye-sight, I should be very glad. This singular man has 
                a great charm to me, though I never liked him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If my thoughts did not weaken and wither, when I try to give them expression in the English language, I should 
                on some sheets give you a due description of our political and literary doings. Although the word of Hamlet: 
                there is something rotten in the state of Denmark, still are true, I have the greatest belief of the vitality 
                of my people and the other Scandinavian peoples. We have been living here in the outskirts of civilization; we 
                have been endowed with its gifts, but we <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">have have​ </span><span class="tei_corr">have​
        
      </span></span> not been poisoned 
                with its venom. Ours is the future in Europe, small as we are.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In no European country, and most probably also not in America, your personality, your mode of 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01910.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01910.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01910.007_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                viewing the things shall be more sure to touch the chord of the native mind as here and in Norway. We are made 
                of the true democratic stuff, we have not the venomous passions, but we have the high ideal aspiration. A peasant 
                on Fijen (one of our fertile isles) wrote to me in the spring for two years ago to thank me for my article on you. 
                Peasants are on the sundays holding the numbers of "for Ide og Virkelighed" 
                in their <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_illegible tei_supplied_source_traubel tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_km">hard fists</span> 
                and read every word, though the matters often are very difficult.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But on the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">political</span> arena our democratic leaders are dull and narrowminded persons, 
                to say nothing worse. None of them has named your book yet, most probably they won't name it at all. It is your 
                (political) adversaries, who write criticisms on you. But your adversaries are mostly your friends, they have 
                themselves a democratic mind and grant you much more than the editors of the American magazines. But your best 
                friends are the women. A young Baroness <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_km">Fraupe</span> 
                has read your books with true enthusiasm. The women have understood, that the ordinary criticisms can as easily 
                be applied on a nature like yours as the process of hair cutting and shaving on a mountain forest. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01910.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01910.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01910.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                "It is nearly comical", writes a young married lady to me, "to see the critics cut and crisp the broad
                American till they have given him their own small figure."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your early female friend Mrs <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_illegible tei_supplied_source_traubel tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_km">Rorle</span> lies 
                deathly over in Roma—poor thing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Professor Rasmus Nielsen has read your book with the greatest satisfaction. He is the only 
                man, who could give a true criticism on it, but he is an old man and not very willing to write in the papers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hoping a speedy amelioration of your health I remain</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
