            <p class="tei_p">Am sitting here by the window in the little front room down stairs, well wrapt
                up—for though bright &amp; sunny it is a cold freezing day—have had my
                dinner (of rare stewed oysters, some toasted graham bread &amp; a cup of
                tea—relished all)—am about as usual—ups &amp; downs—had
                rather a bad day yesterday—lay on the lounge most of the day—now
                better—the worst is my enforced house-imprisonment, sometimes two weeks at a
                time—Spirits &amp; heart though mainly gay, which is the best half of the
                    battle—Love &amp; comfort to you, my
                friends—your wives &amp; all—Write often as you can—(monotony is
                now the word of my life)—</p>
