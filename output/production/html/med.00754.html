                up—for though bright &amp; sunny it is a cold freezing day—have had my
                dinner (of rare stewed oysters, some toasted graham bread &amp; a cup of
                tea—relished all)—am about as usual—ups &amp; downs—had
                rather a bad day yesterday—lay on the lounge most of the day—now
                better—the worst is my enforced house-imprisonment, sometimes two weeks at a
                time—Spirits &amp; heart though mainly gay, which is the best half of the

                    John Burroughs, and Richard Maurice Bucke were
                    three of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy (1850–1929) first
                    met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880, and would go on to write a book-length study of the
                    poet. Burroughs (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C.
                    in 1864 and became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also
                    go on to write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian
                    physician, was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his
                    medical advisors and literary executors. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00754_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00754_n1"><span>The entry in Whitman's
