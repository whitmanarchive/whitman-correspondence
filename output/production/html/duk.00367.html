               <p class="tei_p">I returned to the Regt last night (I have been away on Court Martial you know) and found your letter of July 5th and Mothers, and Hannahs, that you sent me at the same time. Poor Hann I feel quite worried about her and have just written to her saying that Mother and I will come on to see her in the cours of three of four weeks.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Walt I suppose you know that we are going to be Mustered out of service,  we are making out the Muster Rolls now, and we expect to be in New York in about 10 days.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I have been over to Washington two or three times since I saw you, but it was always in the afternoon (after C.M. hours) so that I could not get up to your place in time to see you.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Walt come over and see us,  the stage leaves Willards twice every day, and brings you right to Camp, so jump in and come over.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I have written to Mother to day to let her know that I am coming home, and telling her to get ready for a trip to Vermont. I am sleepy so good night Walt.</p>
