            <p class="tei_p">Just a word any how to let you know I am real well and hearty considering, and haven't forgotten you a bit. Received your kind letter (to which I know this is a poor return). Have a photo: though which I like, taken in N.Y. Will send you one soon as I get them. The G[ilchrist]s [are] well. Herbert is here in New Jersey. B[eatrice] at the hospital. Harry S[tafford] is back at printing. Mrs. S[tafford] not well.</p>
