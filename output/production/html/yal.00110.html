                book—&amp; I will do any &amp; every thing to secure you to your fullest
                satisfaction (if not already—which I thought the case—distinctly, amply,
                legally secured by my letters in the correspondence between us <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ante</span>)—But the copyright of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>

            <p class="tei_p">The steel engraving—just as good as new I believe—I send herewith. It is
                required in the book (to face page 29)—in fact is involved as part of the
                poem. If desired I will sell it to you, as a necessary part of the stock for issuing
                the book—price $50 cash, &amp; 20 copies of book (without royalty)—I
                shall want 200 prints from the plate also—(the printer can make that number
                extra &amp; give me)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The book will make 390 (to '95) pages.

                price.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Before putting in any thing in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="advertisement​ ">adv't'mt</span>​  or circular advertising L. of G. let me be consulted—Show me
