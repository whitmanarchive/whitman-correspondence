            <p class="tei_p">The documents <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —but I cannot agree or convey copyright as therein specified. Of
                course you must be thoroughly fortified in your investment &amp; publication of the
                book—&amp; I will do any &amp; every thing to secure you to your fullest
                satisfaction (if not already—which I thought the case—distinctly, amply,
                legally secured by my letters in the correspondence between us <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ante</span>)—But the copyright of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>
                must remain absolutely &amp; solely in my own hands as hitherto.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The steel engraving—just as good as new I believe—I send herewith. It is
                required in the book (to face page 29)—in fact is involved as part of the
                poem. If desired I will sell it to you, as a necessary part of the stock for issuing
                the book—price $50 cash, &amp; 20 copies of book (without royalty)—I
                shall want 200 prints from the plate also—(the printer can make that number
                extra &amp; give me)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The book will make 390 (to '95) pages. Seems to me every way best for us both that it <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh'd</span>​  be put at <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">two dollars</span>—&amp; that it can well be afforded at that
                price.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Before putting in any thing in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="advertisement​ ">adv't'mt</span>​  or circular advertising L. of G. let me be consulted—Show me
                first.</p>

                Trübner—as we concluded about it the other day.</p>
