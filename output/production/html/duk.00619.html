            with that desease that has been so fatal
            in st louis the spinal disease

                proved to be a letter from one of mattees

            she said hattie<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">9</a>

                    24, 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller dated this letter March 23?, 1873 (Walt Whitman,

                    Press, 1961–77], 2:370). However, the word "monday" is in Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman's hand, and March 23, 1873 fell on a Sunday. Louisa wrote that
                    she had received a letter (not extant) from "one of mattees dear freends."
                    Louisa also wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman on March
                    22–24?, 1873 (not extant) upon receipt of the letter from Mattie's friend,
                    and Jeff with his March 26, 1873 reply acknowledged Louisa's letter and included
                    a cryptic note about Mattie's friend, who was named "Mrs. O'Rielly [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>]" (see Jeff Whitman's March 26, 1873 letter to Louisa

                    "monday" and March 24 was the only Monday that fell between the letter from Mrs.
                    O'Reilly to Louisa and Jeff's March 26 reply to Louisa's letter, this letter

                    1873 suffered a paralytic stroke that initially confined him to bed: it took
                    weeks before he could resume walking. He first reported the stroke to his mother
                    in his <a href="yal.00260">January 26, 1873</a> letter and continued
                    regularly to report his condition in subsequent letters. Helen Price inquired
                    anxiously about Walt's health and wrote that his illness had been reported in
                    the papers (see her January 31, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Trent

                    Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
                    associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
                    Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
                    Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The

                    of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
                    bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00619_n7 note" id="duk.00619_n7"><span>Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman's effort to explain the letter that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
                    received from a "stranger" caused him considerable unease. In his reply to this
                    letter, Jeff referred to the "stranger" as "Mrs. O'Rielly [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>]" and explained who she was—or, rather, explained not
                    explaining who she was in his letter—with a cryptic remark: "in regard to
                    this I must say to you that though I cannot tell you in a letter in regard to
                    why the letters are silent in regard to her I can and will explain the matter."
                    Jeff's odd repetition of "regard" led editors Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M.
                    Price to conjecture that he "clearly intends to hide something" (see Jeff's
                    March 26, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Berthold and Price, ed.,

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering. He married wife Martha Mitchell
