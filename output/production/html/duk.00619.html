            write on two scraps i have picked up
            i received your letter this forenoon
            i dont
            get hardly any letters except yours

            if i answered all the letters i have got since
            you have been sick)
            and i have received

            i got a letter the other day that frighened
            me it was from st louis i opened it and
            the first words i saw was dear madam
                dont be surprised at
                b<span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">e</span>ing  addressed
            by a stranger
            the first thought i had
            was that jeff or the children had been attacked
            with that desease that has been so fatal
            in st louis the spinal disease
             but it
                proved to be a letter from one of mattees
            dear freends she spoke much of the children
            she said hattie
             was a very remarkable child
            and little Jessee was very fat and well
            and said how much matty talked about
            me and a very nice letter it was indeed</p>
