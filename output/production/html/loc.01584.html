                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">It is splendid here to-day, &amp; I am feeling first-rate. We have had quite a 
                dark &amp; rainy spell—but now the prospect is good weather, clear sky, 
                bright sun, coolish, &amp; no dust. I shall spend an hour or two on the river to-day. 
                Your letter of 27th,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Sunday, came this morning. Also two <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Stars</span>, 25th &amp; 26, 
                the latter with Hinton's speech, the other containing an item about me.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> 
                The previous <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span> arrived with your note of 23d, written just as you were 
                going to see the Black Crook<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—&amp; next morning another Star came. 
                Peter, you are a good boy, &amp; shall have your reward in Heaven, if not on earth.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Now how about that cold? I see you went to work Saturday. You seem to be 
                under the weather more than I thought. Dear comrade, I hope this will find you all right 
                &amp; well as ever. I suppose you are working this week. Yesterday I spent most 
                of the day in Brooklyn helping the folks to finish up the moving business. 
                Got through just after dark. I have not been to any amusements yet. 
                Somehow I dont seem to care about them,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> &amp; I go around enough during the day. 
                There is considerable political excitement here—banners swung across the streets 
                almost every block, &amp; big transparences in front of the different headquarters. 
                I have seen several splendid torch-light processions, &amp; outdoor meetings, &amp;c. 
                Of course the great majority in New York &amp; Brooklyn is for Seymour &amp; Blair.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">To Jim Sorrell:<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> Dear Jimmy: You may not understand it, what that lady said about the bedfellow business, 
                but it's all right<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> &amp; regular—besides, I guess you understand it well enough. 
                Jimmy, dear boy, I wish you was here with me—we could have such good times. 
                I send you my love—&amp; to Charley<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> the same—Mention how Charley's young one is getting along—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I will now bid you good bye for this time, my loving friend, &amp; God bless you, dear comrade, 
                &amp; keep you all right. I will write a line to No. 6,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> &amp; will speak to the other boys in my next.
            </p>

                    newspaper contained a report on the payment Walt Whitman received from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Broadway Magazine</span>: "It is needless to add that no other

                    that Walt Whitman had received "fifty pounds in gold." According to his letter
