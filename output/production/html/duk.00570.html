                    Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman is inscribed on George Washington Whitman's <a href="duk.00344">August 16, 1863</a> letter to Louisa. George Washington
                    Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the
                    Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War.
                    He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was
                    taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the
                    war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with
                    a partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up
                    a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    generally forwarded money from Kentucky via Adams Express, a packet and letter
                    service that was founded in the northeast in the 1840s and spread nationally.
                    Adams Express was noted for its trustworthiness and its guarantee of privacy for
                    shippers, which made it a favorite for conveying material that was deemed
                    valuable or otherwise called for discretion. The Whitmans use Adams Express to
                    transfer larger sums of money (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="tex.00169">April 29, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman). For more on
                    the trust accorded to Adams Express, see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive Mail: The

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
                    death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_225.html">Whitman, Martha

                    and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see Martin G.

                    opinion that Andrew must "go out from the seashore if he wants to get well."
                    Jeff also sought Walt Whitman's advice: "Andrew wants to go but dont know where

                        1863</a> letter to Walt). In addition, Andrew sought treatment from an
