                money he writes of going to send

                i thought maybee i should
                have to show the letter to the express
                but i will send it) mat says she
                gesses he is going to get married

                put all i can doo without in certainly
                but if he could see Andrew i know
                he would say mother give him some
                and let him go in the country
                if it will
                doo him good I went down there the other day
                but O walt how poverty stricken every thing
