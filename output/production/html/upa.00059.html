                    10 to 30, and had Christmas dinner with them. In December, Whitman introduced
                    the Gilchrists to Joaquin Miller and took them on December 27 to see Miller's
                    play, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Danites</span>, at the Walnut Street Theatre (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Commonplace Book</span>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
