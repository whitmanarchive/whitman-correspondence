                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
