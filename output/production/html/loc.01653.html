                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been looking for you the last two days &amp; nights—but I have about given you up now. 
                I have been kept in pretty close, as we have had real winter here, snow &amp; bad weather, 
                &amp; bad walking—I have been quite alone, as my brother &amp; sister went off to Delaware 
                on Wednesday on a Christmas visit, to return to-morrow, Saturday—I am about the same—My strength still keeps quite <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01653.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01653.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01653.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                
                
                encouraging—I think is better than any time yet—my walking no better, &amp; still a good deal of distress in the head—but, as I said in my letter of Monday last, (did you get it Tuesday?)—I somehow feel a little more like myself 
                than any time since I was taken down—your last letter was quite a treat—so much about Washington, &amp; folks, one thing &amp; another—As I write I sit here in the parlor—we have had an awful time from the fire going out in the heater, &amp; making it up again—there is so much complicated machinery about one of these heaters with all the late improvements—give me my old stove &amp; wood fire yet—It is snowing by fits here this morning.
