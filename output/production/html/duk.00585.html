            <p class="tei_p">i receeved your letter to day
                with the money and harpers magsine
                i was
            glad to have the number and letter too i scarce
            ever see the magazine now adays but 
            like to read it particularly at present
            for i have had such a sore thumb on 
            my right hand i couldent hardly sew
                a stich i got a splenter in it before the
            folks went away and then slopping about
            in cold water it got so bad i put
                slipery elm on it but it dident doo much
            good but it has got so i can use it to day
            i was so disappointed last saturday in 
            Georges not coming home i wanted him
            to come very much to fix the stove for one
            thing but Edd and i got it up yesterday
            i thought we could hardly get it out
            but we did and its much better it has
            been quite cold here i got a bushel of
            coal this morning and it works much
            better than wood) i havent heard from
                st louis since i last wrote to you walter
            i dont know whether matty is coming
            on here this fall or not i dont think
                it would be good for her i think its
            too late in the season but if they come we
            will doo the best we can) not one of the
               prices has been here since you went
            away you know helen was here just
            before you left and i said i thought
            she hadent a very good time

            i sent a letter to hanna last week a
            good long letter urging her as much
            as i thought would doo to come and mak
                us a good vesit that i particularly
            wanted her to come and that she must
            write to me as soon as she received
            my letter without fail and i suppose
            that will be the last of it i put one dollar
            in the letter and said i send a little
            change but will send more next time
            whether she ever gets any of the letters
            i dont know) i have had thoughts
                of sending a line to Dr thayer what
            doo you think of it walter doo you
                think it would be best or not)  mary
                wanted me very much to go to Burlng
                and she would stay and keep edd
            i told her i dident feel able to
            undergo the journey) you know  mary 
            wrote that Ansel
            they thought failed
            the business was while they were down
            in virginia he got a drinking and
                John Louisa s husband
