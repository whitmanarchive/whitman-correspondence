                    also close with William's wife Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor. Whitman dined with the
                    O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he wrote often in his
                    letters of their daughter Jean "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William

                    emancipated black citizens, Ellen remained friendly with Whitman. For more on
