                <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_center">Walt Whitman.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The time is past when Walt Whitman could be dismissed
                    with a smile or a sneer, and he has already taken his place in the foremost rank
                    of our writers. The public has been slow to recognize the power and value of his
                    work, but no public, possessed of any degree of intelligence, could long hold
                    out against the verdict rendered in his favor by the consensus of English and
                    American critics. No writer of ordinary powers could win the approval and praise
                    of such men (to name but a few) as Tennyson, Swinburne, W. M. Rossetti, J. A. Symonds and E. C. Stedman, and this praise and
                    this approval have been bestowed by them in generous measure. It will appear
                    then, at the present day, neither paradox nor extravagance to say that "November
                    Boughs" (Philadelphia: David McKay) is an important
                    permanent contribution to American literature.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The contents of this suggestively named volume are
                    diversified. There are some twenty pages of poems, half a dozen essays in
                    literary criticism, several miscellaneous prose papers, and much fragmentary
                    reminiscence of a varied and well-spent life. Of most interest, perhaps, is the
                    "Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads," which serves as the volume's preface. In
                    this admirable paper the veteran poet, with the objective vision of age, takes a
                    long retrospective survey of his activities, admitting the reader more closely
                    than before into the secret of his endeavor, and giving clear and forcible
                    expression to the aims for whose accomplishment he has striven. "At the age of
                    31 to 33," he tell us, he found himself possessed by an overmastering impulse.
                    "This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary
                    and poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, emotional, moral,
                    intellectual and esthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying the
                    momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current
                    America—and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date,
                    in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book."
                    The outcome of this ambition was the collection of pieces known collectively as
                    "Leaves of Grass" and the prose papers also put forth from time to time. "The
                    best comfort of the whole business is that, unstopp'd and unwarped by any
                    influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and
                    put it unerringly on record." This is what he tells us, with a pride as
                    pardonable as the occasion for its exhibition is rare even among writers of more
                    than usual sincerity and earnestness of purpose. In another place the feeling of
                    pride leads to this exclamation: "My Book and I—what a period we have
                    presumed to span! those thirty years from <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03489.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03489.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03489.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>1850 to 1880—and America in
                    them! Proud, proud indeed may we be if we have culled enough of that period in
                    its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it to the future!"</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Upon the two matters in which Whitman's work has
                    mainly given offence—its disregard respectively of the conventional
                    requirements of morality and of literary form—this introduction is clear
                    and outspoken. Concerning the latter of these matters we read: "I know well
                    enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and
                    especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not
                    only the divine works, that to-day stand ahead in the world's reading, but
                    dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done or
                    could do. But it seemed to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of
                    estheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not
                    only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and
                    important, of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">their point of view</span>, the time had come to
                    reflect all themes and things, old and new, in the lights thrown on them by the
                    advent of America and democracy—to chant those themes through the
                    utterance of one not only the grateful and reverent legatee of the past, but the
                    born child of the New World—to illustrate all through the genesis and
                    ensemble of to-day; and that such illustration and ensemble are the chief
                    demands of America's prospective imaginative literature." While this plea may by
                    no means be accepted as justifying Whitman's literary form, which has faults of
                    which his defective sense does not allow him to dream, it is valuable as a
                    statement of his aim in writing, and for its hearty recognition of the
                    conventional types of excellence in literary composition. This recognition,
                    indeed, finds further and ample expression in the papers on Tennyson, Burns and
                    Shakspeare which are given in the present volume. Of the real purpose of
                    literature, whether conventional or not in form, Whitman is substantially at one
                    with all the great writers from Shakspeare downwards. "I say the profoundest
                    service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely
                    to satisfy the intellect or supply something polished and interesting, nor even
                    to depict great passions or persons and events, but to fill him with vigorous
                    and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good
                        heart</span> as a radical possession and habit." These words are as noble as
                    they are profoundly true.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The other matter, brought into prominence by the
                    moralists, who have made themselves mainly responsible for the tardiness of the
                    recognition bestowed upon Whitman's work, is thus met, and the opinion is
                    enforced by years of careful reflection. "From another point of view, 'Leaves of
                    Grass' is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even
                    Animality—though meanings that do not usually go along with these words
                    are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a
                    different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few
                    lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath
                    of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been
                    left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become,
                    in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03489.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03489.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03489.007.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>men and women
                    toward the thought and fact of sexuality as an element in character,
                    personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue
                    the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. . . . In respect to
                    editions of 'Leaves of Grass' in time to come (if there should be such), I take
                    occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate
                    renewals of thirty years, and I hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do,
                    any elision of them." </p>
                <p class="tei_p">The few pages of poetry included within this volume
                    should be reckoned with Whitman's most remarkable work. They exhibit, of course,
                    the peculiarities of diction and the general formlessness of the "Leaves of
                    Grass." The reader who is not prepared to accept the writer's theories, or,
                    rather, who is not willing to acquiesce in them for the time being, will not be
                    appealed to by these "Sands at Seventy." Admitting the peculiarities as a
                    constant and consistent factor, there is much that is both striking and fine.
                    Take, for exmaple, this epigram on "The Bravest Soldiers:"</p>
                <span class="inline_quote">
                    <span class="tei_l">"Brave, brave were the soldiers (high-named to-day) who lived through the
                        night;</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">But the bravest press'd to the front and fell, unnamed, unkown."</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">Here is a touch of nature that is admirable in its
                    thought and feeling:</p>
                <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_l">"Simple and fresh and fair from
                        Winter's close emerging,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">As if no artifice of fashion, business, politics, had ever been.</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Forth from its sunny nook of shelter'd grass—innocent, golden, calm as
                        the dawn,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">The Spring's first dandelion shows its trustful face."</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">The following fragment is based upon an incident of
                    the Greely expedition—the hearing of a solitary snow-bird's song by the
                    explorers in 83 degrees of north latitude:</p>
                <span class="inline_quote">
                    <span class="tei_l">"Of that blithe throat of thine from Arctic bleak and blank,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">I'll mind the lesson, solitary bird—let me, too, welcome chilling
                        drifts,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">E'en the profoundest chill, as now—a torpid pulse, a brain
                        unnerv'd,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Old age land-lock'd within its Winter bay—(cold, cold, O cold!)</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">These snowy hairs, my feeble arm, my frozen feet,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">For them thy faith, thy role I take, and grave it to the last;</span>

                    <span class="tei_l">But held by sluggish toes, pack'd in the northern ice, the cumulus of
                        years,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">These with gay heart I also sing."</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">There is something haunting about these lines, with
                    whatever species of composition we may choose to class them, and this haunting
                    quality appears upon every one of the too few pages which contain the poet's
                    latest songs. At his best, Whitman has a genius for style and for apt expression
