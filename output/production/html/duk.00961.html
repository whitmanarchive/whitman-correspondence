            </span>
                <p class="tei_p">Y'rs of 26th has come, &amp; I am glad to get word f'm you after such
                    an interval—Don't wait so long again &amp; you yourself will always be
                    welcome whatever happens—I still hold out here, but a peg dropping out
                    lower every month, &amp; before long will be dropt out for good—hardly get
                    out at all in the wheel chair, or any other way—not once 
                    in a month—In
                    other respects somewhat the same—eat my two meals every day—(an egg
                    &amp; bread &amp; coffee for b'kfast &amp; four or five oysters for supper 
                    yesterday)—has been a hot season here, but clear &amp; cool 
                    to-day—every thing &amp; folks
                    here much the same—Mrs. D[avis] and Warry and 
                    Harry well—Mrs.
                    Mapes out in Atchison Kansas—Mrs. Doughty &amp; 
                    Maggie well—Warry
                    still my nurse &amp; satisfactory—Horace Traubel 
                    married &amp; well—faithful
                    as ever—So good bye for present &amp; God bless you, dear son—</p>
