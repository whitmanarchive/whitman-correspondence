            to sign they are to make
            pipe for the water works
            i was very glad it came

            feel much better when he
            knew you could let him

            Georgey has had trouble
            enoughf all owing to not
                getting a loan on smiths
                house
             the houses is both
            insured and no mortgag
            nor nothing on smiths house
            it seems almost incredible
            to tell but so it is)
             i will
            get george to doo what
            you say) he is having
            the morgage made out to
            Jeffy there will be no other
            claim on it and i think it
            has been a good thing for
            Jeff as well as george
            i suppose the masons will
            commence as soon as georg<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">e</span>
