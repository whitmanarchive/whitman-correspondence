                        March 17, 1869. The calendar date, 17, and day of the week, Wednesday, are
                        in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, but Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
                        letter to the month February in the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
                        with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>
                        [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). However,
                        George Washington Whitman's satisfaction upon his receipt of a bank draft
                        from Walt Whitman in this letter conflicts with George's frustration at not
                        receiving a bank draft just before his departure in Louisa Van Velsor
                        Whitman's <a href="duk.00639">February 16, 1869</a> letter to Walt.
                        Therefore, February 17, 1869 is an impossible date for this letter.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This letter dates to a month later, March 17, 1869, which is corroborated by
                        Louisa's <a href="duk.00576">March 15, 1869</a> letter to Walt and by
                        Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's letter to Walt the following week. Louisa
                        in her letter from two days earlier requested on George's behalf that Walt
                        forward "five or six hundred." George also asked Walt to send a telegraph
                        acknowledgment upon receipt of Louisa's letter because he had to depart for
                        a foundry soon (see her <a href="duk.00576">March 15, 1869</a> letter
                        to Walt). According to this letter, George received Walt's telegraph
                        dispatch just before he was to depart for Philadelphia, and he was pleased
                        that he could expect a bank draft from Walt. A week later, Jeff had received
                        a letter from Louisa (not extant) in which she explained that Walt has
                        "stepped in" to assist George after his "troubles in getting money for the
                        house" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00453">March 25, 1869</a> letter to
                        Walt). Because this letter notes George's receipt of the telegraph dispatch
                        and his relief that a "draft came to day" (March 17), Walt's actions during
                        the past two days (telegraph dispatch and bank draft) are consistent with
                        the requests that Louisa made on George's behalf in her March 15 letter.
                        Jeff's March 25 letter to Walt confirms this series of events from March 15
                        to 17, 1869.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    Jeff began sending George monthly installments of $200. However, some

                    lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
                    pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
