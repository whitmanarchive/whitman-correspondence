            <p class="tei_p">I am getting over my late bad spell—I have been very sick indeed, the feeling
                of death &amp; dizziness, my head swimming a great deal of the time—turning
                like a wheel—with much distress in left side, keeps me awake some nights all
                night—the doctor says, however, these troubles, in his opinion, are from a
                very serious &amp; obstinate <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">liver affection</span>—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> from head,

                got along better than I expected—&amp; shall go out, or try to, to-day, as it
                is very pleasant—You must not be needlessly alarmed, my darling boy, for I

                think I mentioned his sickness,) is dead &amp; buried, poor fellow—I send you
                a bit of piece of mine about him from the paper—I have some spurts of visits,
                &amp; company—but very little that goes to the right spot, with me—my
                brother George has got a horse &amp; light wagon, &amp; takes me out now &amp;
                then—I enjoy it much—but I have been too feeble lately—altogether
                pretty lonesome here, but might be much worse—Love to Mrs. &amp; Mr. Nash,

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
