                    of Joseph Harris and Lewis Brown; all three met Whitman while they were being
                    treated at Armory Square Hospital. On <a href="nyp.00167">July 18,
                        1864</a>, Brown reported that he had not seen Bartlett and Harris since
                    they returned from a spree to Baltimore on July 4, 1864. According to Brown's
                    letter of <a href="nyp.00169">September 5, 1864</a>, the three young men
                    were living in a Washington boardinghouse; Harris was not in good health, and
                    Bartlett worked in the Treasury Department. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_tex.00143_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="tex.00143_n3"><span>John Strain, recorded in

                    (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
                    August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
                    transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Walt Whitman met him, probably in
                    February, 1863. In a diary in the Feinberg Collection, Whitman described Brown
                    on February 19 as 'a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come and
                    sit by him.' Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on January 5,
                    1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary (Thomas Biggs
                    Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #103).
                    Brown was mustered out in August, 1864, and was employed in the Provost
                    General's office in September. The following September he became a clerk in the
                    Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in
                    1880, a post which he held until his retirement in 1915. (This material is drawn
                    from a memorandum prepared by Brown's family, now in the Library of Congress.)"
