You say you have had some hard weather of late. We experienced some of it I dare say—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to know that the boys had such good quarters this winter and hope that they may be able to whip the rebs in the coming contest. I was much pleased to here that Lewis Brown had recovered so much as to go out on pass. tell him to go slow and all will be well in the out come. And tell him that I still look for his &amp; Benedict's photographs. Bartlett's I have.
