                work on is about completed, &amp; the actual work will be so in
                a few days. I have begun working at my translation with a German friend who is fully
                competent to help &amp; has holidays at present, which will permit him to give his whole
                    time.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I propose to bring out the following
                poems—Starting from Paumanok—Song of Myself—The Body
                Electric—Open Road—Brooklyn Ferry—The Answerer—Passage to
                India—Faces—The Square Deific—Out of the Cradle, probably in the

                &amp; think of putting one short poem after each long one; where possible, one which
                should illustrate or illuminate something in the longer one. The whole would come to
                about 130 pages in the German, &amp; I would put a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">short</span>
                preface before the poems. Rather tempted to add notes as well, to light up passages
                which cost me much mental toil to get a little clear to myself, but I shall resist
                this temptation, for I know that it is much better that readers should go through
                this toil for themselves, &amp; if they don't choose to do it, then <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01057_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01057_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01057_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01057_large.jpg</span> it is little good
                that any amount of notes would do them! Of course all the poems given will be
                rendered as faithfully &amp; completely as language permits of. I suppose I might
                say that you have authorized the translation? I shan't let my own name appear, lest
                the fact of my being a foreigner might prejudice people against the translation. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Of course if you have anything to amend or object to in the above plan I should
                alter it in accordance with your wishes. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> By the way—what sort of title would do for the book? 'Selected Poems from Walt
                Whitman's Leaves of Grass'? or better, 'Translations from W.W.'s L. of G.' Or one
                might indeed put simply 'Leaves of Grass', for your successive enlarged editions all
                bore that name, &amp; I hope that gradually this work of mine will expand till your
                whole book is fully rendered in it. </p>

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
