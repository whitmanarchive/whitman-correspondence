         <p class="tei_p">Walt, I received your kind letter<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">2</a> the day after you mailed it, and immediately wrote you
            again. But finding some trouble in procuring a stamp I sent it down to Frank Moran<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">3</a>" to
            have him mail it for me. It appears Frank was taken ill that day, and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">oblidged​ </span></span> to go home; and has not been out of the house since.—I did not find it
            out until today.—But of course my letter to you was not mailed, and now I have
            once more to reply to yours.—</p> 
         <p class="tei_p">I am glad you like Boston Walt, you know I have said much to you in praise both of the
            city and its people.—It is true the first is quite <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">crooked</span>, but it is generally clean, and the latter, though a little too
            straight-laced for such free thinkers as you and I, are a very hospitable, friendly, lot
            of folks.—You tell me Mr. Emmerson<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">4</a> (one m to many I
            guess?) came to see you and was very kind.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—I heard him lecture in Dr Chapins<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a> church on Friday evening last, on the subject of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">manners</span>,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">7</a> and though very much pleased with the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">matter</span>, I did not at all like his delivery. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00779.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00779.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00779.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00779.jpg</span> It appeared to me to be
            strained, and there was a certain hesitation in his speech and occasional repetition of
            words, that did not affect the hearer very well.—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But, Walt, when I looked upon the man, &amp; thought that it was but a very few days
            before that he had been so kind and attentive to you, I assure you I did not think much
            of his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">bad delivery</span>, but on the contrary my heart warmed
            towards him very much. I think he has <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> in him which makes
            men capable of strong friendships.—This theme he also touched on, and said that a
            man whose heart was filled with a warm, ever enduring <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not to be
               shaken by anything</span> Friendship was one to be set on one side apart from other
            men, and almost to be worshipped as a saint.—There Walt, how do you like that?
            What do you think of them setting you &amp; myself, and one or two others we know up in
            some public place, with an immense placard on our breasts, reading <em class="tei_emph">Sincere <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Freinds​ </span></span>!!!</em> Good doctrine that but I think the theory preferable to the
            practice.—I am glad very glad Walt to hear you are succeeding so well with your

         <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new here Walt. Everything remains about the same. I suppose of course
            you see the New York papers every day. Our streets are just about as dirty as ever, but
            the dirt is not allowed to remain long in one place, this March wind picks it up and
            scatters it with a perfect looseness in your eyes,
            ears, mouth, and nose. It penetrates to the house, covering the floor the furniture and
            even the beds in a manner not at all agreeable to persons who have any idea of
            cleanliness.—Monuments erected in mud to the honour of the street inspector have
            to be regularly wet down, or like riches, and birds they take to themselves wings and
            fly away.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a>—I have an idea that "There is a better time coming" But so far have been

                    (1803–1882) was an American poet, essayist, and leader among the
                    Transcendentalists. In his famous letter to Walt Whitman of <a href="loc.02109">July 21,
                    1855</a>, Emerson wrote of the first edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of

                        29, 1860</a>, Whitman wrote to his friend, the social reformer, Abby H.
                    Price: "Emerson called upon me immediately, treated me with the greatest
                    courtesy—kept possession of me all day—gave me a bully dinner."
                    According to Whitman's recollections written twenty years later, Emerson also
                    attempted to persuade him not to publish the "Enfans d'Adam" poems in the 1860
                    edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. The date of the meeting was
                    probably March 17, 1860, since on that day Emerson obtained reading privileges
