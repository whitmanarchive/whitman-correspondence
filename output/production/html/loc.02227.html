            <p class="tei_p">When my friend, Mr. Linton was here last, I asked him, during one 
                of our conversations about you, whether I might venture to send you the book I was then 
                writing, as soon as it came out. If he had not encouraged me to do 
                so, I should hardly have liked to trouble you with it, and yet there is no one living 
                by whom I am more desirous to be known than by you. The "Leaves of

                of Grass" have become a part of my every-day thought 
                and experience. I have considered myself as "the new person drawn toward" you; 
                I have taken your warning, I have weighed all the doubts and the dangers, and the result 
                is that I draw only closer and closer to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I write this I consider how little it can matter to you in America, how you are regarded 
                by a young man in England of whom you have never heard. And yet I cannot believe that you, 
                the poet of comrades, will refuse

                the sympathy I lay at your feet. In any case I can but thank you for all that I have 
                learned from you, all the beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy 
                men and women, and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people. The 
                sense of all this was in me, but it was you, and you alone, who really gave it power to 
                express itself. Often when I have been alone in the company of one or other of my dearest 
                friends, in the very deliciousness of the sense of
