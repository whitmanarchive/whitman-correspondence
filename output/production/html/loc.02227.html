                of our conversations about you, whether I might venture to send you the book I was then

                I have taken your warning, I have weighed all the doubts and the dangers, and the result

                learned from you, all the beauty you have taught me to see in the common life of healthy 
                men and women, and all the pleasure there is in the mere humanity of other people. The 
                sense of all this was in me, but it was you, and you alone, who really gave it power to 
                express itself. Often when I have been alone in the company of one or other of my dearest
