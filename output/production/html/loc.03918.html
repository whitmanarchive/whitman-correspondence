            <p class="tei_p">Thanks my dear friend for the nice chicken—I have just had a part of it for
                my dinner—&amp; the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">honey in the comb</span> just like that
                is something I like—I had a very pleasant visit out in Germantown—I went
                partly at the request of a fine jolly young Englishman who is visiting there for a
                few days, &amp; told me much about my friends in England (of whom I find I have far
                more than I knew of)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am about as usual—feel considerably better, more able to get around <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00540_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00540_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00540_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>since the cool
                weather has set in—had rather a bad summer—my walking power gives out
                more this year, &amp; I am afraid is destined to be worse, instead of
                better—otherwise I am about the same—appetite good—spirits
                ditto—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I am sorry I wasn't in when you stopped this forenoon—have been hoping you
                would stop this afternoon—Does George keep well this fall?—Ruth how do you
                like married life?—I rec'd <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the
                    cake</span>—very nice—Well Ed, how are you about Cleveland?—I am just as well satisfied—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I have rec'd a long letter from Herbert—nothing
                very new. The Lord bless you &amp; be with you all—</p>
