            <p class="tei_p">"That my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing each other, and never perhaps 
                to see each other, is every bit as wonderful"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> and that I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful, 
                and that I can remind you, and you think them and know them to be true is just as wonderful." Indeed there is very 
                little in Leaves of Grass but what I know to be true. It is some more than two years since I first read your book, 
                and sometimes I have felt so in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">raport​ </span></span> with your feelings therein 
                expressed that I have written you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dozzens​ </span></span> of letters, and I have no 
                doubt you would have got them, had they been done on paper, or any material <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">transmittible.​ </span></span>

                I presume I have read "The Open Road" twenty times or more. Last fall I was staying over two months—with 
                Mrs Dr. Severance of Milwaukee.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I read it to her—and one evening she asked me to read it again, her husband 
                being with us, for she said I read it as tho I understood it. Yes, and how "utterly quelled and defeated" too I 
                have felt to find my strength <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">so much less</span> than my impulses. The poem "To You" has been 
                worth wonders to me, so inclined am I to self reproach. Your "Song of Myself" I have read over and over again. No 
                poems ever gave me so confident a hope in a continued existence. If only "the lover for whom <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> 
                pine will be there"! How I long to find them here! and do—scattered everywhere, and their very existence 
                makes me long for them. All around me I see "Of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the rotten 
                excrement of maggots," and so in my loneliness when I try to be happy with them all that is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">true</span> 
                to me 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03147.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03147.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03147.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03147.003_large.jpg</span>

                pleasant grounds—and houseroom enough, but the provider and "head of the house" seems ever determined that 
                we shall realize our dependent positions. How easy it is to discover and acknowledge our superiors, but when any 
                person uses a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">domineering</span> superiority over you, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">resistence​ </span></span></span>

                    (1846–1941) was born in Rock Island, Illinois, the daughter of John
                    Liberty Bean and Marilla J. Smith. In 1869, she married Davenport, Iowa,
                    businessman William T. Minchen, and the couple had three children, John Paul,
                    Abigail Louise, and Florence. The Minchen family lived in Carroll, Iowa.
                    According to Minchen's obituary, she was "one of the first to advocate woman's
                    suffrage" and "always intensely interested in all forward looking movements."
                    The obituary also describes Minchen as "an extensive reader" and a member of the
                    Clio Club, a group that founded the Carroll Public Library in 1894. She died at
                    her daughter Florence's home in San Mateo, California, and is buried in Carroll
                    City Cemetery in Carroll, Iowa. For more information, see her obituary, "Mrs. W.

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    (1812–1886), an abolitionist and philosopher, was absorbed in utopian
                    schemes to establish a universal language, to reconcile all great thought, to
                    discover a science of the universe ("Universology"), and to institute a new
                    social order which he called Pantarchy. Trowbridge related Whitman's adverse
