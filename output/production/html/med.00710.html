            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have yours of 31st ult. Have written Forman as you suggest and have also written McKay (send you enclosed a copy of the letter that you may see
                plainly on what footing you are with him). If the book
                is published in London <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">before</span> it is <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="published​ ">pubd</span>​  in America I
                believe the copyright will be as safe as the bank of
                England. Archie Bremner is
                still here on the staff of "Advertiser"—The notice in the "Press" was very gratifying, hope you will send me any you can
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">particularly the adverse ones</span>—You do not say anything about sending copies as I asked you in
                my last, I take it for granted

                meantime that you will attend to this—and also
                that you will have balance of my ten copies sent me here soon as
                convenient—The weather here now is perfect and the grounds look better than I
                have ever seen them We are all well and send you love</p>
