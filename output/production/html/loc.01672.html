            <p class="tei_p">I ought to have written to you before—but I believe lazy &amp; listless fits
                grow stronger &amp; frequenter on me as I get older—&amp; then I dont do anything at all, especially just the things I ought to do—But I
                often, often think of you boy, &amp; let that make it up. I certainly am feeling
                better this winter,—more strength to hold out,—walking or like, than for
                nearly now four years—bad enough yet, but still <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">decidedly better</span>—(My loving boy I underscore the words, for I
                know they will make you feel good, to hear)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I heard about the accident on the road at the time two weeks ago—&amp; was
                uneasy enough until I heard definite particulars—such things seem the
                fortune of RR travel, which I sometimes think more risky than the "fortune of war,"
                which the knowing ones know well is more chance &amp; accident (I mean the victory
                in battles) than it is generalship—</p>

                am feeling quite comfortable—I stood the cold snap of the last three days very
                well—to-day has been moderate &amp; nice here—Nothing new or special in
                my affairs—I am selling a few of my books (the new 2 Vol. 10 dollar edition)
                from time to time—mostly to English &amp; Irish purchasers—it is quite
                funny how many of my books are sent for from

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
