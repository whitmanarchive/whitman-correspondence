            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I ought to have written to you before—but I believe lazy &amp; listless fits
                grow stronger &amp; frequenter on me as I get older—&amp; then I dont do anything at all, especially just the things I ought to do—But I
                often, often think of you boy, &amp; let that make it up. I certainly am feeling
                better this winter,—more strength to hold out,—walking or like, than for
                nearly now four years—bad enough yet, but still <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">decidedly better</span>—(My loving boy I underscore the words, for I
                know they will make you feel good, to hear)</p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01672.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01672.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01672.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I heard about the accident on the road at the time two weeks ago—&amp; was
                uneasy enough until I heard definite particulars—such things seem the
                fortune of RR travel, which I sometimes think more risky than the "fortune of war,"
                which the knowing ones know well is more chance &amp; accident (I mean the victory
                in battles) than it is generalship—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Pete I am sitting up here alone in my room, 8 o'clock p m, writing this—I
                am feeling quite comfortable—I stood the cold snap of the last three days very
                well—to-day has been moderate &amp; nice here—Nothing new or special in
                my affairs—I am selling a few of my books (the new 2 Vol. 10 dollar edition)
                from time to time—mostly to English &amp; Irish purchasers—it is quite
                funny how many of my books are sent for from
                Ireland—</p>

            <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Love to you dearest son—</span>
