                The copy suitable for an edition here should we be able to reach to that I have and
                shall keep carefully. When it is achieved it will probably be the result and fruit
                of more reviewing and discussion. I shall keep my eyes wide open; and the volume
                with O'C's introduction shall come out just as it is.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> I
                am not sure but that it will in the end have to be done at our own
                expense,—which I believe would be repaid. It is the kind of book that if it
                can once get out here will sell. The English groan for something better than the
                perpetual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">réchauffé</span> of their literature. I have
                not been in London for some little time and have not yet had time to consult others
                about the matter. I shall be able to write you more satisfactorily a little later. I
                hear that you have written something<a href="#n0294" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0294">3</a> in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Galaxy</span>.<a href="#n6001b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6001b">4</a> Pray tell O'Connor I shall look to him to send me such things: I can't take <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> American magazines; but if you intend to write for the

                    been trying to secure a republication in England for his fourth, 1867 edition of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. On April 30, 1867, Conway had
                    informed William Douglas O'Connor of a conference, attended by Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Michael
                    Rossetti, and John Camden Hotten, the publisher. At the meeting, it was decided that a
                    complete edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> could not be
                    published in England without "legal prosecution on any publisher" (Henry W. and
                    Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library; Bliss Perry, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin and Company,
                    1906], 185). This statement was later denied; see Conway's letter to
                    Burroughs (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1931], 47).
                    A volume of selections was eventually decided upon; see Whitman's <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/tei/pri.00011.html">November 1, 1867</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway. Since Whitman was
                    determined to guide the London edition, he sent to Conway an "Introduction" that
                    he had composed but had attributed to O'Connor, who was thus to introduce 
                    Whitman to English readers. A manuscript in Whitman's hand in the Pierpont Morgan
                    Library, "Introduction to the London Edition," is dated August 1867, and was
                    later corrected to read September, 1871; it is reprinted by Clifton Joseph
                    Furness, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Workshop</span> (Cambridge: Harvard
                    University Press, 1928), 150–154. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n0294">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0294 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0294"><span>On August 1, 1867, William Conant Church, from
                        the office of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>, wrote to William Douglas
                        O'Connor: "It seems to me that this glorious harvest of 1867, sown &amp;
                        reaped by the returned soldiers, ought to be sung in verse . . . . Walt
                        Whitman is the man to chaunt the song. Will you not ask him to do it for The
                        Galaxy?" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                        Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In response, Whitman submitted "A
                        Carol of Harvest, for 1867" to William Conant and Francis Pharcellus Church
                        on <a href="prc.00009">August 7, 1867</a>. In their letter of <a href="loc.01278">August 8, 1867</a>, the editors told Whitman that
                        they considered "A Carol of Harvest, for 1867" (later titled "The Return of
                        the Heroes") "to rank with the very best of [his] poems." Negotiating the
                        publication of the poem, Whitman, in his letter of <a href="prc.00010">August 11, 1867</a>, reserved the right to publish the poem
                    in an edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                        no sooner than six months after the poem's publication in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>. Whitman acknowledged receipt of $60 as
                        compensation for "A Carol of Harvest, for 1867" in his <a href="nyp.00265">September 7, 1867</a>, letter to the editors.
                    The poem was published in the <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00192.html">September 1867</a>, issue of the magazine.
                       Whitman also submitted a second poem, "Ethiopia Commenting," which was never published in
                        the magazine. </span></span> [<a href="#r0294">back</a>]</li><li id="n6001b">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n6001b note" id="n6001b"><span>Francis Pharcellus Church

                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
