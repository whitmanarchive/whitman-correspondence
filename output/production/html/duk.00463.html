                    is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the
                    letter to the month September and the year 1865, and Edwin Haviland Miller cited
                    Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). "27" is somewhat obscured by
                    the postscript, but the number is certain because Louisa also wrote to Walt that
                    she "received your letter yesterday all right the 26th." The letter concerns
                    Burlington, Vermont, and Louisa arrived for her only extended visit to daughter
                    Hannah Heyde on September 5, 1865. She returned in mid-October of that year.
                    Therefore, September 27, 1865 is certain as the date of this letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00463_n2 note" id="duk.00463_n2"><span>Walt Whitman's September 26,

                    Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among
                    the Whitmans for his offensive letters and treatment of Hannah. Louisa in her
                        <a href="duk.00461">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman had
                    labeled Heyde a "little conceited fool." According to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"

                    visited Hannah in September 1865 because of a quarrel about "some women that
                    Heyde had in his room." According to that letter, Louisa informed Jeff that she

                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. Eddy remained in Brooklyn during Louisa's visit to

                    whom Louisa and Eddy lived in the Portland Avenue home. George and his wife

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
