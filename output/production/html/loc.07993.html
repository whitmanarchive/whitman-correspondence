                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Johnston's first wife, Amelia F. Many (1839–1877). From 1927 to 1931, she
                    served as the President of the oldest women's club in the United States: the
                    Sorosis Club. She was married first to William J. Johnston (1853–1907), a

                    journalist and friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the
                    Civil War. Swinton, managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                    Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman.
                    Whitman's correspondence with Swinton began on <a href="bos.00006">February
                        23, 1863</a>. Swinton's enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On <a href="loc.01955">September 25, 1868</a>, Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly
                    impressed with the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you.
                    I read this afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never
                    before read. I could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more
                    to me than all other books and poetry." On <a href="loc.01957">June 23,
                        1874</a>, Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter":
                    "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the
                    'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street,
                    Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something
                    that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me,
                    grown around me, and grown into me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
                    36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
                    for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the
                    weekly labor journal, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Swinton's Paper</span>. When this
                    publication folded, he returned to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. See Robert

                    Whitman. The two began a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
                    early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
                    the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
                    volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
                    to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13,
                        1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
                    two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
