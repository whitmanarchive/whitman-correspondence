                to do. I believe in the potency of science to reconstruct society, but not being a
                poet I had not credited it with "clearing a field for verse". I will believe this
                also, adding it to my "creed" the "I believes", of my religion which years ago I

            <p class="tei_p"> May I tell you how I have come to Walt Whitman worship? </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Twelve years ago, when just awaking from the aimless woman life into which I was
                educated, I was persuaded to read "Leaves of Grass," by my brother who believed in
                you its author. I had heard of it of course, heard very bad things of it too. I was
                certain <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_medium">my</span> dear
                brother would not ask me to read a bad book. I was too uninformed in poetry then, to
                appreciate the "Leaves" as I now do. But it did not impress me as a bad book, crude
                as I was. I am and always have been very glad it did not. Other women and men whom I
                talked with at that time and I am sorry to say ever since called it coarse. I
                comforted myself with Thoreau's word of you in his "letters", which you doubtless
                know by heart as I do. Later I read Joseph B. Marvin's review in <span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_high">the</span> "Radical Review" <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01083.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01083.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01083.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01083.004_large.jpg</span> and felt supreme
                self satisfaction in these words, "Only the voices of the manliest and the womanliest
                can rightly accentuate the words of "Leaves of Grass" etc. I had been <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">brave</span> enough to read aloud at a "Decoration Day" service
                in a church one of your pieces "Come up from the Fields Father". I am not a public reader and was <span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_low">trembling with</span> fright, but I must have
                "accentuated" the poetry for it brought tears to the eyes of many, and at its close, Wm. C. Gannett came forward to me
                with a beautiful earnestness in his truly thoughtful face saying "who wrote that"
                "will you let me take it home". (the copy of Drum Taps). That was my hour of triumph for my poet.
                For I had heard Mr. Gannett say, a friend of his a lady who knew you, said you were
                "coarse." </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have waited for your vindication, with the assurance of perfect satisfaction that
                it would come. I read with delight Edmund C. Stedman's article in the late Scribner,
                not as wholly satisfactory to me as <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_low">Mergars's</span> in the Radical, but just and sweet and will be
                more widely seen and read than <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_8">[cut away]</span>. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I would be very glad to see you, but <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01083.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01083.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01083.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01083.005_large.jpg</span> that may never be. Remember me as
                one however who has always believed in you, always admired your words. If I were
                younger I would strive with all my <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_8">[cut away]</span> to do something worthy of my worship of your genius, worthy to be remembered by you.
                But at fifty years of age crippled by a poverty <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_high">that</span> makes me use the greatest portion of my
                energy to be economical and pursue a
                domestic vocation I cannot do much. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I must not expect to draw upon a writers time to reply to this letter. If you will
                but acknowledge its receipt, and will tell me where and when the article mentioned
                by Stedman, the "recantation of Emerson" appeared I shall esteem it a great favor. I
                never knew this had been written and I could never quite forgive Emerson for his
                retraction from the commendation once bestowed upon you. </p>
