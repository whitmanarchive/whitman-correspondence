                    see the letter of <a href="yal.00097">September (?) 1866</a>. John
                    Burroughs called it "an eloquent article . . . but it told untruths about him.
                    Walt said it did" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 39).
                    William O'Connor wrote to Conway on December 5, 1866: "A great deal of it I
                    liked very much, and I think the general effect of it was very good. In part of
                    it, there was a tone I regretted. Pardon me. I think the time is past when this
                    august man should be written of as a curiosity, or his poem mentioned as
                    something monstrous. You do not do this, it is true, but there are, here and
                    there, lines and touches in your article, which suggest such a treatment and
                    leave me unsatisfied" (Yale). However, to John Townsend Trowbridge, O'Connor
                    labeled it "a frightful mess of misstatement and fiction" (Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs</span> (1931), 40). Whitman, and therefore
                    his friends, objected to two of Conway's anecdotes in particular: Whitman's
                    lying on his back at Coney Island with the temperature at 100 degrees, and the
                    description of his room in 1855. In 1888 Whitman observed: "I can't help feeling
                    still a little suspicion of Conway's lack of historic veracity: he romances: he
                    has romanced about me: William says lied: but romanced will do" (Horace Traubel,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [Boston: Small, Maynard
                    &amp; Company, 1906–1996], 3:16). William Michael Rossetti repeated the
                    Coney Island tale in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Walt Whitman</span> (London: John
                    Camden Hotten, 1868), 15–16.. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
