                much to doo but it has got to such a pass that she depends
                        to much on me if i felt strong and well i would not mind it
                she is kind to me but somtim<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">e</span> i dont feel like dooing so much) Jeff looks bad he

                lengthy epistle from him the other day i really think the world never produced such
                another man or devil i think he is nearest the last named i wrote very short with no
                compliment that was not surprised at his wishing to get rid of han that he had
                expressed that wish many times before this letter but i had never made any reply not
                wishing to interfere with family difficulties but in all probability he would get
                his desire) he said every thing that he could say in his letter to me and he was
                going away that he should take care of himself and she could take care of herself
                that all the pleasure he had was with his fellow artists) George and smith and
