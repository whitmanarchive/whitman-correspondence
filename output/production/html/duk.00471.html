                    1866. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "June 7 thursday" in her own
                    hand, and June 7 fell on Thursday in 1866. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
                    letter to the year 1866, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date

                    consistent with Louisa's residence at the Pacific Street house with Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Furthermore, Walt
                    Whitman addressed numerous matters from this letter in his <a href="nyp.00208">June 12, 1866</a> reply to Louisa: the improvement of
                    the pain in his head, his invitation for Jeff to visit him in Washington, and
                    the expectation that his brother "George will do well, in the houses, if he

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working

                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
                    later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
                    (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.

                    between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
                    Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
                    treatment of Hannah. Louisa wrote, "if heyde was kind to her she would get well"

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
