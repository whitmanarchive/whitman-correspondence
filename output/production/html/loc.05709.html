            <p class="tei_p">
                I see by the Tribune of to-day
                that (by the hands of one of your "never
                dying audacious elected men"—is not
                that what you call them?) you have
                received another blow from the ignorance
                &amp; hypocrisy prevailing in our civilization
                on the subjects treated in your "Leaves 
                of Grass"—a civilization which nevertheless,
                one generation after another, confirms
                Rabelais as a classic, and swallows the
                Song of Solomon as Holy Scripture, instead
                of simply classing it with the 
                beautiful lays of Anacreon &amp; Swinburne
                and with the necessary text, more or 
                less, of all great literatures, none of
                which can possibly ignore an exhaustive
                survey of life and all its functions. And
                that this blow is going to deprive you of 
                what might be and ought to be a sufficient
                source of comfortable income to you in your
                declining years.

                I have little time at present
                for correspondence outside of what is
                compelled by routine duties, but if you
                will put me in communication with some

                for you, and will send him (or yourself
                directly if you prefer) twenty-five dollars,
                in the hope that some few at least of 
                appreciative men of means may subscribe
                those figures with a cipher or two 
                after them. Our big Masonic temple
                here, with perhaps a million dollars
                worth of material &amp; labor sunk in
                it, was built from a subscription
                started by a poor man with an offering 
                of one dollar.

                I remember a buffet given you
                in former years by one of the Cabinet 
                Secretaries in whose Department you
                had been placed, and I suppose you,
                like all men &amp; women—poets or other—ahead
                of their time, have been well
                used to such, but, if a subscription
                were started in your behalf, it would,
                I think, be found that your "Leaves of
                Grass" have made friends for you, who
                would be glad to draw sympathy for you 
                and substantially forestall the unavailing
                gratitude (so far as Walt Whitman
                in the flesh is concerned) of posterity.

                    revert to its files to see whether your
