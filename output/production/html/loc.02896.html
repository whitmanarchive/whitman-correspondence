      </span></span> it would be well for you to give me a line to Prof. Dowden, telling him
                that you have read the bibliography of my forthcoming book, and that you think you
                can commend the work to his careful reading. Also a word of introduction to Symonds,
                in case he will be willing to write an Introduction to it, (the book). I am afraid
                they will be but dilatory in taking hold of the matter on my request alone,. But a
                word of introduction from you, worded as you please, would secure their devoted
                service. There is not a word of criticism in the book; it is solely an enthusiastic
                eulogy and an interpetation and defence of your whole life, aims, and work,—accompanied by a
                valuable <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="bibliography​ ">bibliog.</span>​  and concordance, with an appendix, and three illustrations. My belief is
                that it will have a great sale in Great Britain, if it is got before your public
                there in the right way. For my part, I dislike to ask anyone for to serve as
                go-between, but you seemed to think it would be wise. Be sure and tell me always how
                you are. I am just finishing the chapter "Walt W. &amp; his Friends". My roses are
                superb; have pitched a tent in my yard. </p>
