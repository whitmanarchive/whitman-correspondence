                that you have read the bibliography of my forthcoming book, and that you think you
                can commend the work to his careful reading. Also a word of introduction to Symonds,<a href="#n0615" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0615">3</a>
                in case he will be willing to write an Introduction to it, (the book). I am afraid
                they will be but dilatory in taking hold of the matter on my request alone,. But a
                word of introduction from you, worded as you please, would secure their devoted
                service. There is not a word of criticism in the book; it is solely an enthusiastic
                eulogy and an interpetation and defence of your whole life, aims, and work,—accompanied by a
                valuable <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="bibliography​ ">bibliog.</span>​  and concordance, with an appendix, and three illustrations. My belief is
                that it will have a great sale in Great Britain, if it is got before your public
                there in the right way. For my part, I dislike to ask anyone for to serve as
                go-between, but you seemed to think it would be wise. Be sure and tell me always how
                you are. I am just finishing the chapter "Walt W. &amp; his Friends". My roses are
                superb; have pitched a tent in my yard. </p>

                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry
                    and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
                    known. See Andrew C. Higgins, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
