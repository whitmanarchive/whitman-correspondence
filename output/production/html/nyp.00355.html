      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been worse than usual for a week—very pronounced swimming spells &amp; dizziness in the head, 
        with sometimes deathly faintness &amp; great prostration—(twice I thought serious)—am sitting up to-day &amp; yesterday—havn't been out—now this is the ninth day—continuous qualmishness &amp; headache—doctor thinks however it is all substantially 
        a stomach &amp; liver business—he comes every day—does not seem to be alarmed—I am taking mild powders of mercury for the liver—&amp; drops composed of bromides 
        of potash &amp; ammonia—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">There is death all around me here—Two yesterday of persons I know—I send you a piece by me 
        from the paper here<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—the young man alluded to was much like one of my most cherished soldier cases 
        in the Hospitals ten years since. He lived on the next block, &amp; I was with him 
        a great deal—&amp; at death.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I just send you, (although one or two items confidential, sort o') Mrs. Price's last letter to me, 
        two days since—read it, &amp; destroy it—I also send Mrs. Davis's, she (Mrs. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Price​ ">P</span>​ ) sent me, 
        as you are interested in her—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I shall get better, &amp; shall come on to Washington yet—on a brief visit—Tell Charles Eldridge 
        I shall write to him this week—My brother &amp; sister &amp; Eddy here are well—My sister at Burlington, 
        Vt. was as usual at last <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​ s—also Jeff &amp; his girls at St. Louis—As I write I am sitting here 
        in my big chair alone (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">alone muchly</span>,) in the parlor by the window—It is a rainy darkish day here—the wind south &amp; mild—</p>
