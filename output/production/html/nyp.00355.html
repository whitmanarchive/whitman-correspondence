        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your late letter reached me, enclosing the piece from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Academy</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have been worse than usual for a week—very pronounced swimming spells &amp; dizziness in the head, 
        with sometimes deathly faintness &amp; great prostration—(twice I thought serious)—am sitting up to-day &amp; yesterday—havn't been out—now this is the ninth day—continuous qualmishness &amp; headache—doctor thinks however it is all substantially 
        a stomach &amp; liver business—he comes every day—does not seem to be alarmed—I am taking mild powders of mercury for the liver—&amp; drops composed of bromides 
        of potash &amp; ammonia—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">There is death all around me here—Two yesterday of persons I know—I send you a piece by me 
        from the paper here—the young man alluded to was much like one of my most cherished soldier cases 
        in the Hospitals ten years since. He lived on the next block, &amp; I was with him 
        a great deal—&amp; at death.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I just send you, (although one or two items confidential, sort o') Mrs. Price's last letter to me, 
        two days since—read it, &amp; destroy it—I also send Mrs. Davis's, she (Mrs. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Price​ ">P</span>​ ) sent me, 
        as you are interested in her—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I shall get better, &amp; shall come on to Washington yet—on a brief visit—Tell Charles Eldridge 
        I shall write to him this week—My brother &amp; sister &amp; Eddy here are well—My sister at Burlington, 
        Vt. was as usual at last <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​ s—also Jeff &amp; his girls at St. Louis—As I write I am sitting here 
        in my big chair alone (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">alone muchly</span>,) in the parlor by the window—It is a rainy darkish day here—the wind south &amp; mild—</p>

        <p class="tei_p">If Pete Doyle comes up to see you, read him this letter—also give him the printed slip to read—</p>
