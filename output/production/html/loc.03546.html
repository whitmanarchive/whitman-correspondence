            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> 
                I have not written to you all these years because I knew there were many others waiting for a word or line and 
                I could not bear to add even a feathers weight to your burden. I should not do so now only I think I am getting to 
                feel a little hungry for a sight of your hand writing once more, and a few lines of remembrance and affection.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Mr Arthur Stedman came to see me several times 
                last week and gave me lots of information about you and your surroundings and

                friends in Camden. That was all good and I was indeed grateful for it, but I want just a few lines from you if you 
                feel able to write.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p"> 
                What a long hard hill and strain it has been for you the last fifteen years. My eyes fill with tears when I think 
                of it. I knew you, as you know, in your splendid health and prime, and so realize the more keenly perhaps, what the 
                loss of all that has been and is to you. I know you have had a poor spell lately. Are you growing better? Let me 
                know dearest Walt just how you are.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">
                We are all about as usual in Woodside. Emily and her family are prospering. 
                Her oldest boy nearly 21 is with Arthur in Florida. He resigned from the Navy several years ago, and is 
                very cheerful and

                contented in Florida on his orange grove; he writes me that he is a 
                good deal of a Hermit down there. Abby has grown up into a beautiful young lady and quite accomplished in music. The 
                twins are fine boys The one I have is a Stenographer in a lawyers office. He is truly the chief comfort of my life. 
                Walter is a fine handsome little fellow now about 11, and crazy for horses; can ride horse back, 
                drive a four in hand, and in fact cares 
                very little for anything else.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">
                I live very quietly in my little cottage, rent the lower floor and though I feel cramped a good deal sometimes 
                by poverty, yet am thankful to be as well off as I am.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                I was very much surprised to hear of Jeff's death. What was the cause? and are his daughters married?
                and where are they? George and Lou I should like to hear about them and above all

                Eddie Mr. S. told me he was living.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">
                There is a matter that has come to my notice lately that I am very anxious to get at the truth about, and 
                is one reason for writing to you now.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                When you revised the matter for Dr Bucke's book at our house did you do so from the original documents 
                or from proof sheets of the same. The letter he published written by you to my mother about the 
                hospitals and sacred almost to me came back torn and mutilated A change was made in the wording 
                and meaning of a sentence and the correction torn out. 
                         
                There was not a line or erasure anywhere 
                else on the letter, though you made a number of changes yourself, I think from the proof sheets. 
                Let me know please dear Walt what you remember about it It is important to me though I shall make 
                no use of the information whatever. I only want to be sure that it was not you that multilated it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Mr S. showed me the <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_hc tei_unclear_cert_low">large</span>      
                last edition of Leaves of Grass. Also November Boughs which I had not seen. How much is 
                it a copy. I must have one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Talking with him brought up the old times so vividly. 
                When our dearest mothers were 
                living and well. Those dear old days are gone never to return again. Ah me! Life is somewhat 
                of a tragedy, is it not?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Write me soon if you feel able, dear Walt. I am so desirous of knowing that you are better</p>
