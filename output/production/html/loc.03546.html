                and meaning of a sentence and the correction torn out. 
                         
                There was not a line or erasure anywhere 
                else on the letter, though you made a number of changes yourself, I think from the proof sheets. 
                Let me know please dear Walt what you remember about it It is important to me though I shall make 
                no use of the information whatever. I only want to be sure that it was not you that multilated it.</p>

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"

                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke

                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
