            <p class="tei_p">I send my love to Helen and Emmy &amp; all—I have rec'd a letter from mother to-day—she seems to be about the same as usual—I hope Helen or Emmy will just go over &amp; visit her without ceremony as often as possible. Give my respects to Mr. Arnold<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>—also to Mr. Price—It would give me the greatest pleasure to see you or Helen here in Washington.

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
                    the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's Monthly</span> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
                    deeply." For more information on Whitman and Abby H.
