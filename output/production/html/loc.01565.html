                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend Hiram,</span><a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 27th May<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> has come safe to hand, &amp; I was truly glad to hear from you. 
                Hiram, you must not think I have forgotten you, for I have thought of you too 
                many times since the days we used to see each other there in the Hospital. 
                Lewis Brown is well. I see him often. He has a place here as Clerk, at $1200 a year. 
                He is in the 4th Auditor's Office, Treasury Department, &amp; that is his address. 
                Did you know Adrian Bartlett—in Ward K? He is also a clerk in 4th Auditor's. 
                Thompson,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> the one so low with diarrhea, went home to New Jersey, 
                &amp; I have never heard from him since. Taber was killed in one of the Battles of the Wilderness. 
                Shot in the head &amp; fell instantly. Tom Sawyer, (Lewy Brown's friend), 
                passed safe through the war—but we have not heard from him now for two years. 
                Dr. Bliss is practising here in Washington. Dr Bowen<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> also. Old Armory Square 
                is now used as an Army Clothing depot. Of course all the big hospitals are 
                long broken up—there now remain only the Post Hospital, U. S. A. on K st. 
                &amp; two or three small regimental hospitals in &amp; around the city.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As to me &amp; my fortunes I am in pretty good health, thank God—&amp; I am working in the Attorney General's office (as the heading of this letter.)
                It is an easy kind of place—the other clerks are all young men, friendly 
            &amp; jovial—So I have things pleasant enough. The pay is 1000 a year.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">6</a></p> 
                
            <p class="tei_p">Miss Lowell<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">7</a> is still around—is interested in the African schools. 
                Lewy Brown has just been in to see me—he says he wrote two letters 
                &amp; wrote to your mother—Joe Harris often asks for you &amp; is doing well—is in the State Office—Mrs &amp; Miss Martins are well.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Curly, at last accounts, was home in Ohio. Cate is home in New Hampshire—he has been committing matrimony—&amp; is now supposed to be suffering 
                the consequences—poor reckless young man—Mrs. Wright<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">8</a> is at Flushing, L. I., New York. She is in the Soldiers' orphan home.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Hiram, you ought to have put in your letter how you got along with your leg since, 
                &amp; how you are now in health, &amp; how you are situated. 
                I want to hear all about you generally—all the particulars.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well I believe that is all this time. I send you my love, dear friend 
                &amp; soldier, &amp; I hope this will find you well in health &amp; in good spirits. 
                So God bless you, boy, &amp; for the present I must bid you Farewell—</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">After seeing Walt Whitman's name in a newspaper, Sholes (mentioned in Walt
                        Whitman's <a href="nyp.00180">April 21, 1863</a> letter to Thomas P.
                        Sawyer) wrote to him from Albany on <a href="loc.01920">May 24,
                            1867</a>. Sholes had occupied a bed next to Lewis Brown's in Armory
                        Square Hospital in 1862 and 1863, and recalled Walt Whitman's visits: "My
                        kind friend (for so you must permit me to call you) I have thought of you
                        many times since I left Washington and how well can I remember you as you
                        came into the Wards with the Haversack under your arm, giving some little
                        necessary here, a kind word there, and when you came to Louis [Brown's] bed
                        and mine how cordialy you grasped our hands and anxiously enquired into our condition. I
                        thank you for all this and you in your lonely moments must be happy in
                        thinking of the good you have done to the many suffering ones during the
                        war." In his <a href="loc.01921">June 8, 1867</a> reply, Sholes
                        reported that his health was excellent, but not his economic lot: he had
                        been an attendant in an insane asylum, a watchman, and a doorkeeper,
                        positions he was able to hold for only short periods of time. (These letters
