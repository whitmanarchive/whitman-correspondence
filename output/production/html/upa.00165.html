            <p class="tei_p">After dinner, now, seated out in an arm chair under the tree, the grass below, &amp; the good breeze laving me, I have just read (&amp; reread) the three letters, yours &amp; Herby's &amp; Mr Carpenter's—sweet, &amp; welcome &amp; bracing all of them somehow—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Yes, dear friend, I will be up by Thursday evening, in time for tea, if nothing happens—Count much on seeing you all, &amp; the cluster of friends—May-be while there are so many with you I had better sleep over in Camden, &amp; Herby &amp; Mr Burroughs take my room &amp; bed—but we will see when I come—the days I shall surely be there—</p>
