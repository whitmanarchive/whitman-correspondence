                    changed his plans. He wrote to Whitman on August 10 after a three-week trip to

                    the middle of September. See the letter from Walt Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of

                    written to Burroughs early in May inviting him to meet Edward Carpenter.
                    According to his next letter of May 16, Carpenter was to visit Burroughs at the
                    latter's home. On June 5 Burroughs mentioned a three-day visit: "I like him
                    much—a modest, sensible man and a great admirer of W. W." (Clara Barrus,
