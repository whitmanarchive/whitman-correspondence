                    which printed both original works and reprints with an interest in typographical
                    innovation. The Club produced periodicals, as well as reprints of rare, curious,
                    and old American, English, French, and Latin books (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American

                    the Bradstreet book-bindery, all 150 copies of the Club's second volume, and by
                    extension the Club itself, which folded in 1868 when Hammond elected to focus on
