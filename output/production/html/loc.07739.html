                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    faintest way, the deep down emotions that that book excites in me. There is
                    nothing stirs me up like it. Sometimes as I read it I feel as if my whole
                    previous life were rolling en masse through me, and as if at the same time vast
                    vistas were opening ahead which I longed and yet half dreaded to enter. The
                    profound religious sentiment which that book is destined to develope in the
                    human heart when it becomes once assimilated by (incorporated into) the life of
                    the race is, I think, simply inconceivable at present." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
