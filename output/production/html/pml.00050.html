            <p class="tei_p">I still keep quite well considering—have been down here the past week—every thing much the same as of old with our friends the S[tafford]s—Mr and Mrs S, and all their sons and daughters—Harry is down at Atlantic City, telegraph operator at a RR station but is going to Camden, same position—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">A fine week down here for me—the finest sort of mellow sunny autumn weather—the old woods fine &amp; I in it for hours every day (sometimes I think it as good in its way as the Creek)—I go about nearly the same, my lameness no better (occasionally pretty bad, worse) but my feelings of comfort &amp; strength in general better than former years—often decidedly better—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">This month <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner</span> has a long criticism by E C Stedman on L of G &amp; author, quite funny—"I would &amp; I would not" style, with a bad portrait—Dr. B[ucke] is furious—Burroughs thinks it well enough &amp; will do good—probably the truth between the two—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I see in the papers allusions to "the Gilchrist Thomas process" &amp; its adoption in some of the great works &amp; foundries—So I think it must be a permanent triumph—I congratulate you all &amp; of course Percy especially (for all I dont know him)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Rather cold, the feeling of snow, but dry &amp; pleasant in a way—I sell some of my books occasionally—have quite a supply left—of late have had more <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> purchasers than foreigners—(different from previous experience)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Rec'd your letter of two months since in Canada—it was very welcome—I wrote a postal card from here to Herbert, over a month ago—Did he get it? Is the address on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this</span> right? Do you see any thing of my friend Josiah Child? A gentleman named Ingram (in the Engineer's office, London General Post Office) has written to me twice in the interest of publishing a Vol: of my prose writings in London—He seems to be a nice sort of man (is the author of an edition of Poe in London)—I think I shall give him your address &amp; ask to call on you.</p>
