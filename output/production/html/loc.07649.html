            <p class="tei_p">Superb sunny day again &amp; I am feeling all as right as could be
                expected—Still on mutton broth with toast &amp; plenty of rice &amp; a few
                mouthfuls of the stew'd mutton. As I told you, bowel action fair—A little
                of what I call cold in the head, but slight so far—Dr Walsh here last evn'g—he himself quite unwell—no Osler now for a fortnight—I enclose Mrs:
                O'C[onnor]'s card rec'd this mn'g—Ed: Stafford has been here—they are 
                all well as usual &amp; every thing goes on the same as of old—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">So we have commenced on another year—&amp; where it will take us, &amp;

                (with a gambler's uncertainty) makes the background &amp; basis of the 
                whole business—I have been reading "Goethe's &amp; Carlyle's correspondence"
                wh' I find interesting—presents C in a different light from any 
                other—</p>
