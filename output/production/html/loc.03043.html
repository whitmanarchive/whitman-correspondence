            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got your cordial letter of the 25th. Congratulations and approval, personal and
                from the press, are pouring in upon me, but I shall get nothing worth so much as
                your heartful "God bless you," flashing from

                     the finale of your postscript.
                Next best, is your admiration of my lightnings. It fills me with measureless content
                to know that what I have written is not merely a success with the public, but with
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had given the letter up and was taken aback by its appearance. Of course, I was
                delighted, for my article puts

                     the matter just in the shape I wanted it to appear—gives us
                the ground to fight <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">from</span>—a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">base</span> for operations. It
                cost me immense labor, for I had to be very guarded and very bold at once, blending
                composure with fury, and was anxious not to lay myself open to the disingenuous
                enemy. I am satisfied. Let <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03043.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03043.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03043.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Oliver Stevens and Osgood get over this if they can. It will
                stick.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is probably the beginning of a fight and we will comport ourselves according
                to events. Let Stevens or Marston dare to reply! I will exterminate them. After the
                affair has gone its full length, some of us—perhaps <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03043.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03043.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03043.007_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                I—will have the grand
                closing word, solemn as life, copious as the tempest, in the North American Review.
                Mr. Rice will give us a hearing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The moment I get John Burroughs' address abroad, I will mail him a copy of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span>, which I have

                     reserved for him. I think John
                will be delighted with my sword-play. Besides, I want him to know the facts, so that
                he can fire up the literati abroad.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish the article I wrote for Bucke could appear, because a part of it was devoted
                to

                the recent
                critiques on your new edition, and every sentence was a blister. I wrote one in
                particular on the Rev. Higginson, which I was going to add when Bucke sent me the
                proof, and which will make Higginson wish he was in another and a better world. I have
                not yet found out from Bucke why his book is delayed.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I earnestly hope the matter will bear fruit in your getting another publisher. If
                there is one publisher in this country who has the least sense, he will take
                advantage of the conspicuity the District Attorney has given you, and come forward
                with an offer to publish.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I had written thus far when your letter of the 28th came, containing the
                article of the Rev. Chadwick in the Sunday Tribune, which I had not seen. Of course
                I shall answer this clerical blackguard, who has the audacity to accuse me of
                wilfully and consciously lying, and I shall do my best to answer him with blasting
                effect, but I am truly sorry to have to turn aside to the discussion of veracity
                with such a fly as this. The harm I foresaw from your equivocal statement in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Critic</span> and The N.

                warned you, has come in this letter of Chadwick's. I feared that the enemy would
                make this use of your language. "Howandiver," as Father Tom says, we must endeavor
                to turn the disaster to the best advantage, and make something by the operation.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I
                shall certainly try to weave in all the memoranda you send me.</p>

                and friendly, and evidently pleased with me, and the poignant and perfumed little
                note of thanks I sent him after the appearance of my letter. He says: "I took great
                pleasure in printing your letter, because it was so cleverly done, and because
                besides, I could not help having some sympathy with it." I was glad to get this
                letter, for the assurance of innings at the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> office which it gives me.</p>

                consoling, and shows a real gentleman. Doubtless we shall hear much more.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If we can only send Chadwick to the moon in fragments! My task is to do this, and
                thoroughly, the first time. No after claps. If I fail, his abominable letter will
