      <p class="tei_p">It is now about noon, &amp; I have just come over to the office, and have put up the window 
        for a few moments, to stand &amp; get the fresh air, &amp; then put it down again. Right opposite 
        the window—in the President's grounds a man in his shirt-sleeves is raking up the grass 
        that has been already cut on a ¾ acre patch—so you can see spring has advanced here—the trees are quite green—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I have had the second application of electricity to-day, quite a good application by Dr. Drinkard—he rubs the handles over my leg &amp; thigh, for perhaps twenty minutes—the shock is very perceptible—it is not painful at all, feels something 
        like pressing a sore—I feel as I said before, that it will be beneficial to me, 
        (though there are different opinions about it)—I feel better to-day than yesterday—I think, mother dear, there is no doubt at all that I progress surely though very slowly, 
        (&amp; with an occasional bad spell)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Did you read in the morning papers to-day about the fight with the Modocs out in California—&amp; Col. Mason—I think (but am not sure) it is Jule Mason<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—it is quite interesting—I am going to work for a couple of hours now at my work in the office books—I am feeling quite comfortable this afternoon.
