                prospect of "seeing W. &amp; B. so soon."</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> As I have seen no intimation of the arrival of the "British Prince" up to date, 
                tho' she was due at Phila. yesterday, I presume she

                today. In that case Wallace will see you face to face for the
                first time today and perhaps at this moment 7.20 p.m here—about 2.20 pm with
                you—he is sitting by your side &amp; holding sweetest of sweet converse with
                you. Somehow I have a feeling that he is either with you or very near to you as I
                write this, &amp; I should like to know the exact time &amp; date when he does see
                you first. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02516.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02516.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02516.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> How
                memorable that meeting will be &amp; how pregnant with vast issues not only for him
                but for us all none of us can tell &amp; I love to dwell upon it &amp; I long to
                participate in its great joys—nay I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">do</span> participate
