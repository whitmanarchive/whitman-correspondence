He writes that they are short of provisions and requests me to send him a box, if nothing more than salt pork and hard tack.  So of course they must be pretty hard up for grub or he would not run the risk of haveing it sent through the lines.  I have sent to Walton to send to Lt. Caldwell a box of Stores.  And I would say if you could send some to George the same time it would come verry exceptable to him no doubt.
