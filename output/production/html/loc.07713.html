                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Whitman sent a cluster of poems entitled "Old Age's Echoes" to Henry Mills Alden
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span> and asked $100
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.]). On
                    October 24, Alden rejected the work: "It is too much of an improvisation for our
                    use. I had it set up, hoping that, seeing it in type, I might come to a more
                    favorable impression of its form. The thought is worthy of a more careful
                    texture in its parts &amp; of a more shapely embodiment as a whole. I am not
                    critisizing. Criticism has no place in the poet's world. I am writing only as a
                    Magazine editor with reference to Magazine requirements." Alden's letter cannot
                    be located. On November 2, 1889, Whitman sent the piece, now called "Old Age
                    Echoes," to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth Century</span> and asked £20; the
                    editor, James Knowles, returned the manuscript on <a href="loc.03209">February 21, 1890</a>. The "3 or 4 sonnets poemets," as the poet
                    characterized the work in his Commonplace Book, were eventually published in the
                    March 1891 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Magazine</span>. Here, the poem
                        "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00140.html">Old-Age Echoes</a>" consists of the "poemets" titled "Sounds of the
                    Winter," "The Unexpress'd," "Sail out for Good, Eidólon Yacht!" and "After
                    the Argument." "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">To the Sun-Set Breeze</a>" appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's

                    (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
                    sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,

                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the

                    (1832–1904), the British poet and journalist, had visited Whitman in
                    Camden in September 1889 and wrote frequently about it. See for example, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">Arnold and Whitman</a>," which was published in the September 26, 1889,

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
