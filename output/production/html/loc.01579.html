                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Charles Hine,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received with gladness the authentic sign &amp; proof that you are on hand &amp;
                doing, viz. "Watsons Art Journal" with notice &amp;c.—I am anxious
                to see the picture. I am sure it must be a thing of beauty, glowing, human, &amp;
                true. Believe me, my friend, I have not forgotten you, nor your old kindness &amp;
                friendliness. Also Mrs. Hine &amp; the daughter—to whom I send best
                remembrances. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">As soon as I come to New York again, I will visit you at the studio. In the meantime,
                I send you by same mail as this a copy of my last edition, also a little book,
                written by Mr. Burroughs,
                (a second Thoreau,) and a newspaper, with letter—the book &amp; letter all about my precious
                self—&amp; I dare say may interest you. If the books are not brought by the
                carrier, you must send to p. o. for them. I have seen Faris here, but now he has
                gone back to N. Y. I am working in the Attorney General's office—have a
                pleasant berth, moderate pay, but sufficient—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am well, weight nearly 200, &amp; eat my rations every time. You must write, &amp;
                let me know whether the books come safe. </p>
