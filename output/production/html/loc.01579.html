            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received with gladness the authentic sign &amp; proof that you are on hand &amp;
                doing, viz. "Watsons Art Journal"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> with notice &amp;c.—I am anxious
                to see the picture. I am sure it must be a thing of beauty, glowing, human, &amp;
                true. Believe me, my friend, I have not forgotten you, nor your old kindness &amp;
                friendliness. Also Mrs. Hine &amp; the daughter—to whom I send best
                remembrances. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">As soon as I come to New York again, I will visit you at the studio. In the meantime,
                I send you by same mail as this a copy of my last edition, also a little book,
                written by Mr. Burroughs,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
                (a second Thoreau,) and a newspaper, with letter<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—the book &amp; letter all about my precious
                self—&amp; I dare say may interest you. If the books are not brought by the
                carrier, you must send to p. o. for them. I have seen Faris<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> here, but now he has
                gone back to N. Y. I am working in the Attorney General's office—have a
                pleasant berth, moderate pay, but sufficient—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am well, weight nearly 200, &amp; eat my rations every time. You must write, &amp;
                let me know whether the books come safe. </p>

                    (1827–1871) did an early oil painting of Walt Whitman, the engraving of
                    which was the frontispiece for the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>. In 1889 Whitman observed of Hine's portrait: "I don't know but
                    the best of all" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.58.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996], 4:378).
                    Hine's reply to Whitman's letter is not extant, nor is Whitman's second letter
                    written shortly before June 17, 1868. On <a href="loc.01729">June 17,
                        1868</a>, Hine wrote: "Be assured of the high estimate I place upon your
                    gift, and the glowing thoughts to which you have given utterance. 'Leaves of
                    Grass' forever!…My dear old friend, I love you." Whitman visited Hine
                    shortly before his death, a visit mentioned in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00282">July 26, 1871</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor and his <a href="loc.01580">July 28, 1871</a>, letter to Peter Doyle. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01579_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01579_n3"><span>In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Watson's Art Journal</span>, 9 (April 25, 1868), 11–12, appeared
                    "'Sleep': Painted by Charles Hine." The article described his painting of a
                    female nude, and concluded: "We know no picture of modern date that is in any
                    way comparable with it. It is a work, necessarily sensuous, but utterly devoid
                    of sensuality." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01579_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01579_n4"><span>
