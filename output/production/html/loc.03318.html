            <p class="tei_p">I have this morning received your card of the 11th rec'd. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Specimen​ ">Spec.</span>​  Days in America</span> makes its appearance in the London book-shops
                to-morrow, &amp; before you get this I expect you will have a preliminary batch of
                six copies of the volume. I am writing to the publishers to-day to instruct them
                about sending the 50 more you want. The publishers seem to have made some mistake
                about the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Preface</span> &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Addl
                    note</span> printed slips. I gave them distinct instructions about sending them,
                &amp; I must just make them pay for their mistake by sending you further copies of
                the book to supply the omission. I enclose two cut-out leaves which they sent to me
                last week, with some vague idea of atonement, I suppose.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday afternoon J. Addington Symonds<a href="#n0615" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0615">1</a> called here
                unexpectedly when I had a pile of the Spec Days Vols. on the table, &amp; he was delighted with the appearance, &amp;c. of the
                book. I took him a copy on going to dine with him &amp; Roden Noel<a href="#n3109" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3109">2</a> in Eaton Square last night. I sent copies off to many other
                folk yesterday,—Mrs. Costelloe<a href="#n6109" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6109">3</a> among the rest. She wrote
                me a nice little note about it, which arrived this morning. Gabriel Sarrazin, the
                young French critic, who is writing a study of L. of G., which he is tremendously
                taken with, shall have one to-day or to-morrow.<a href="#n3115" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3115">4</a>

                general get-up of the book, &amp; so on. If we have made any slips in this respect
                in the book, we can profit by them in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Democratic

                &amp; deliver it too; but I suppose that may not be. The gathering of the literarati in the audience was very significant. It shows a new departure, I think,
                on the scholastic literary side.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By this time I expect Herbert Gilchrist<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">6</a> is with you &amp; has
                given you a general account of things over here. (Give him my hearty greetings!) By
                him I sent a batch of birthday wishes for the 31st, which I follow now with all
                imaginable devout orisons. In your coming year I earnestly <span class="tei_add tei_add_type_unmarked tei_add_place_left">hope you will have the great gratification of seeing a deeper &amp;
                    wider application of Leaves of Grass, pointing to a nearer consummation of their
