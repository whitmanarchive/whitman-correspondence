            <p class="tei_p">Was very glad to get y'r letter—(I return herewith the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nation</span> criticism)—I have rec'd another letter from Tennyson—Rec'd
                to-day a letter from John Burroughs. He is rather blue—the boy Julian is his
                great comfort—the "domestic skies" (as he terms it) are not fair and
                happy—I hear from Kennedy—Rhys is there with him &amp; they take to each
                other muchly—I am invited (by letter from Cortland Palmer, rec'd to day) to go
                to R's lect: before the Century Club, NY Feb 7, &amp; say a word at
                conclusion—But of course cannot go—I have rec'd a nice letter from
                Whittier, thanking me, &amp;c. I hear from Dr Bucke regularly &amp; often—he
                is true as steel—</p>
                
             <p class="tei_p">Has been very bleak &amp; cold here but better &amp; sunny to
                    day—I am quite unwell, but keep up &amp; around &amp; eat my meals in
                    moderation—(an old fellow who comes here said to me as I was eating my supper
                    "No extremes any way—but eternal vigilance in eating &amp; drinking is the
                    only thing for a sick man or an old coon.")</p>

             <p class="tei_p">I want to print a little 15 or 20 page <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Annex</span> to L of
                 G—Also a sketch of Elias Hicks—but don't know when—</p>
