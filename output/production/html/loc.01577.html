            <p class="tei_p">In reference to the brief conversation between us a few days since, allow me in
                candor to say, that I should decidedly prefer to retain my present post as Record
                Clerk, the duties of which I feel that I can fulfil properly—&amp; that I
                would therefore, as far as my personal choice is concerned, wish to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> thought of in view of the pardon clerkship.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">Only in case of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">urgent wish</span> on your or Mr. Browning's part,
                would I deem it my duty to waive the preference mentioned, &amp; obey your commands.</p>
