                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    Whitman had come down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his
                    right lung. Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would
                    never recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel
                    Longaker of Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care
                    during his final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4b">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08060_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.08060_n3"><span>Anne Montgomerie

                    and one son, Wallace (1893–1898). Anne was unimpressed with Whitman's work
                    when she first read it, but later became enraptured by what she called its
                    "pulsating, illumined life," and she joined Horace as associate editor of his
                    Whitman-inspired periodical <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Conservator</span>. Anne edited

                    Horace's death, both Anne and Gertrude edited his manuscripts of his
                    conversations with Whitman during the final four years of the poet's life, which
