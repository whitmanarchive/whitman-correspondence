                    friends at Camden was John R. Johnston, "the jolliest man I ever met, an artist,
                    a great talker," per Whitman's <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>
                    letter to Peter Doyle. Johnston was a portrait and landscape painter who for
                    years maintained a studio in Philadelphia and lived at 434 Penn Street in
                    Camden. See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New-York Historical Society Dictionary of
                        Artists in America, 1564–1860</span> (New Haven: Yale University Press,
                    1957). On the verso of Anne Gilchrist's letter of <a href="loc.02881">February 21–25, 1875</a>, Whitman scrawled some trial lines for an
                    inscription: "written in memory of the good times Sunday evening's in Penn
                    street, 1875—'4 &amp; '3." The poet was fond of Johnston's children, Ida
                    and Jack (John Jr.). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
