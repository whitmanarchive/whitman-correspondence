                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join

                    the mother of Ansel Van Nostrand, who married Walt Whitman's younger sister
                    Mary. Mary Van Nostrand had written on February 16, 1868 that Ansel's mother
                    "cannot live." Louisa reported Aunt Fanny's recent death in this letter.
                    Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver tentatively dated Mary Van Nostrand's letter
                    to 1867, but Louisa's <a href="duk.00514">February 19, 1868</a> letter to
                    Walt dates firmly to 1868, so Gohdes and Silver's provisional date for Mary's
                    letter is incorrect. Louisa had written in her <a href="duk.00517">February
                        25, 1868</a> letter that "i have heard nothing from aunt fanny i suppos
                    she is living yet," which is consistent with a report on a genealogy site that
                    Fanny Van Nostrand died on March 9, 1868, two weeks before this letter (see
