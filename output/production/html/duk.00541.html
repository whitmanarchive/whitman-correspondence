                have written at any rate it seemes
            so to me i should have wrote and
            said i had received the letter of friday
            but it was such a dreadful storm
            saturday then i thought i would wait
            till to day i have got the one you sent
            on friday or i got it on friday and one to
            day both with 5 dollars and the book for 
             mary came friday and the galaxy to day
                with the ballad of sir ball
                i had forgotton
                all about the peice till i see it and
            then i had to think where i had heard
            of it and then it came to my mind
            what piece it was it is signed w i hope
            nobody will think you wrote it walt)</p>

            a very satisfactory visit but she thought
            she must go to day she came last monday
            a week ago yesterday) she thinks so much
            of her daughter minnie she almost
            worships her nothing but what they will
            indulge her in)
            when martha
            was there
            she seemed to think they were either

             mary said she dident know how much
                they had but i shouldent wonder if she
            did as her son george came down with her
