            <p class="tei_p">Would you be willing to entertain a proposition to cross this Autumn to England and
                deliver a course of lectures in a few of the larger cities?</p>

                concerns you. I should be willing to guarantee you a stated sum or if you would
                prefer it star you on a percentage. My friend and yours, R. Macaulay Stevenson<a href="#n4298" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4298">2</a> of Glasgow, perhaps better known to you as "Calamus," thinks
                that your reception throughout Scotland would partake of the character of an
                ovation.</p>

                respect,</p>
