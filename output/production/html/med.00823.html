                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Sir:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Would you be willing to entertain a proposition to cross this Autumn to England and
                deliver a course of lectures in a few of the larger cities?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">From facts in my possession I am quite sure that you would be very successful for the
                cultured class of Great Britain have an abiding interest in you and everything which
                concerns you. I should be willing to guarantee you a stated sum or if you would
                prefer it star you on a percentage. My friend and yours, R. Macaulay Stevenson of Glasgow, perhaps better known to you as "Calamus," thinks
                that your reception throughout Scotland would partake of the character of an
                ovation.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Pray let me hear from you, and you believe me, with sentiments of the deepest
                respect,</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Faithfully yours,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Sheridan Ford</span>
