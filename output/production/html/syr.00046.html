            <p class="tei_p">Your card of 26<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> to hand this morning. I grieve much that you should be depressed and by me
                about O'C. but I am anxious that his possible death at any time
                should not take you unawares for if it did I fear it [would] be a terrible shock to
                you. [—] Weather here bright and colder, very pleasant—We keep all
                well—nothing new with us. [—] I have had quite a time the last few days
                arranging and posting recent additions to my W. W. Collection. It is growing rapidly
                and assuming very considerable proportions. Nothing new about the meter Willy
                Gurd still here—he is waiting for Nesbit (our other
                partner) who should have been here to consult long ago but does not come for some
                reason</p>
