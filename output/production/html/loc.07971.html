                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was a close acquaintance of Walt Whitman and one of the poet's literary

                    daily beginning in the late 1880s. The result of these meetings—during which
                    Traubel took meticulous notes—is the nine-volume collection <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/index.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span>. Later in life, Traubel also
                    published Whitmanesque poetry and revolutionary essays. He died in 1919, shortly
                    after he claimed to have seen a vision of Whitman beckoning him to 'Come on'.
