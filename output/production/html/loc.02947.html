            <p class="tei_p">William is on his way to Bar Harbor, Maine, care Dr. Kinnear, Wall's cottage. Wm. was disposed to try Dr. K. as soon as he heard of his method, which is Dr.
                Chapman's, with which Wm. was familiar, applications <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02947.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02947.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02947.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> of heat &amp; cold to the
                    spine. Probably Wm. wrote you, he said he should, when he read your letter to me. The Ashtons
                were very anxious to have him try Dr. Kinnear, &amp; William feels that he ought—to
                try any one who gives him reasonable assurance of help. He says he wants "either his
                legs, or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wings</span>," as locomotion of some <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02947.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02947.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02947.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> sort is

                    where Wm. is,</span> I mean not any one who will speak of it, he asked me to
                caution all the friends; above all he says <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">don't let it get
                    into the papers</span>, for already some vile creatures are grumbling at his

                will kindly bear it in mind. Mr. Kimball thought he
                better not let it be known. He (W.) said he should make Dr. K. tell him at once
                whether he could help him. He shows a deal of energy in starting off as he does,
                &amp; as to his courage it is simply <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sublime</span>, &amp; he
                puts all my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">theoretical</span> trust to shame by his practical

                it. A friend here offered to go all the way to Bar Harbor with him, but he said it
                was all "nonsense", that he found plenty of people ready to jump to help him, his
                crutch is very appealing, &amp; now he uses that &amp; his cane <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">both</span>. At any rate, he is out of this awful heat &amp; sultriness. I hope
                you keep up under it.

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, the other day I found a package of letters belonging to you carefully put
