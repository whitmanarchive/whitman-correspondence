                    was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
                    staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
                    daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
                    time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
                    dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
                    often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
                    Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
                    1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
                    emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02947_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02947_n1"><span>Apparently O'Connor

                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
