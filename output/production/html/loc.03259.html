                fifty years ago the year I came from England—then a mere youth, but as I was

                &amp; was &amp; was in theatrical parlance a "first nighter" referring back to Booth

                inspiration—none could equal him save perhaps Forrest in two characters—Richilieu &amp; King
                Lear—his stentorian voice &amp; powerful frame which gave him perhaps an
                advantage over Booth but Forrest even in these characters was the perfection &amp;
                not the genius of acting—I never witnessed Forrest acting but the houses were
                jammed, my experience of witnessing Booth was not so fortunate as yours—I seldom

                or the "Iron Chest" both pieces besides all you name I saw him in—at this
                representation I speak of—he played to empty benches as far as memory
                serves—There could not have been fifty persons in the house—I was in the
                pit or what is now called the parquet—I never can forget his marvelous acting

                she was a charming singer—certainly no English singer of my time, can be

                first Bouffe I ever heard—his voice was somewhat off when he came to this
                country, but he was a great singer—it was for he that Rossini wrote his Barber
                in the Barbiere di Sivilgia as well as for Madame de Begnis— a very good singer I believe for she
                was before my time—but a very bad immoral woman—they were playing the

                burnt up meaning that his turkish dresses were consumed—he was a character I

                the Walnut—to better houses. Things have changed since the days of
