                fifty years ago the year I came from England—then a mere youth, but as I was
                intimately acquainted with the Treasurer of the Park Theater under Price<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a>—I had the entreé at that theater at all times
                &amp; was &amp; was in theatrical parlance a "first nighter" referring back to Booth
                he was the genius of all the players—neither Macready<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> nor Vandenoff<a href="#n4107" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4107">8</a> (the elder) nor <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Charles​ ">Chas</span>​  Kean<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">9</a> or Booth (his son) or Irving<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">10</a> could compare to him his acting was
                inspiration—none could equal him save perhaps Forrest<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">11</a> in two characters—Richilieu &amp; King
                Lear—his stentorian voice &amp; powerful frame which gave him perhaps an
                advantage over Booth but Forrest even in these characters was the perfection &amp;
                not the genius of acting—I never witnessed Forrest acting but the houses were
                jammed, my experience of witnessing Booth was not so fortunate as yours—I seldom
                saw him to big houses the last time I saw him was at the Chatham Square theater—a

                servant named "Maral" I cannot remember without reference whether it was this piece
                or the "Iron Chest" both pieces besides all you name I saw him in—at this
                representation I speak of—he played to empty benches as far as memory
                serves—There could not have been fifty persons in the house—I was in the
                pit or what is now called the parquet—I never can forget his marvelous acting
