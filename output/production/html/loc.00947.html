                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
                    1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
                    Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
                    Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
                    more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

                    way to visit George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington
                    and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk in the office of the
                    army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George had not been severely
                    wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his home until 1873.
                    Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the
                    army paymaster. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00947_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00947_n3"><span>Charles Joseph Howells,
                    according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
                    perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
                    an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
                    in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00947_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00947_n4"><span>George Wood
                    (1799–1870) worked as a clerk in the Treasury Department in 1822, and he
                    held various posts in that bureau until his death. He was the author of several
                    satirical works, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Peter Schlemihl in America</span>
                    (Philadelphia: Carey and Hart, 1848) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Gates Wide Open;

                    he became acquainted with Whitman through Ellen and William O'Connor. Ellen
                    O'Connor mentioned a Mr. Wood in her letter of <a href="loc.00943">July 5,
                        1864</a>. In reply to Whitman's letter, evidently delivered by O'Connor
                    and dated "Thursday"—probably <a href="loc.00878">[January 15,
                        1863]</a>—Wood wrote: "You sometimes find a poor soldier whom a
                    Small Sum would relieve and I beg you will distribute these pieces of paper as
                    you shall see best on your visit to the Hospital." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00947_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00947_n5"><span>Carey Gwynne was listed

                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
                    (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
                    partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
                    covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
                    powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York, Rowman
                    and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
                    translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
                    O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on <a href="med.00324">August 13,
                        1864</a>, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
                    attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
                    pistol."
                    Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
                    phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
                    (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
                    I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
                    trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
                    Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first category of his threefold
                    evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and
                    "Blame." The Count referred in his entry for April 18, 1864, to Whitman as among
                    "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote
                    (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had
                    "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that
                    would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised

Beach was one
                    of those enigmatic women associated with Whitman about whom imaginative
                    biographers have spun ingenious theories. Beach was to have reviewed the 1860
                    edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>, but when her husband's unfavorable review was
                    published instead, the journal had to take public note of matrimonial discord in
                    order to correct the error (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary
                        Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</span> [New York: Macmillan,
                    1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967], 260–262). Ellen O'Connor
                    contributed her bit to the theory that Beach and Whitman had a love affair when
                    she asserted that "Out of the Rolling Ocean, the Crowd," published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, was composed for "a certain lady" who had
                    angered her husband because of her correspondence with the poet (Emory Holloway,
                    ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</span>
                    [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921], 1:lviii). "Mrs. Beach's notes"
                    may be the letters to Whitman, which later John Burroughs vainly asked Mrs.
                    Beach to print; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 1:120. If
                    these were love letters, Whitman hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings
                    discreetly. See also Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>,
                    340–342. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00947_n8 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00947_n8"><span>The Prices were friends
                    of Mrs. Whitman. The husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn; see
                    Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>, 199–200. His wife Abby,
                    as one might expect, was closer to Whitman, who corresponded with her frequently
                    in the 1860s. Whitman always interested himself in the Price children, Helen,
                    Emma, and Arthur (another son, Henry, had died at 2 years of age). Helen's
                    reminiscences were included in Bucke's biography, and she printed for the first
                    time some of Whitman's letters to her mother, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's
