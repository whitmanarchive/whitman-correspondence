                    stroke, at the age of 61, Whitman apparently met the 25-year-old C.W. Post on
                    the return leg of the poet's autumn, 1879, western trip. At the time he met
                    Whitman, Charles William Post (1854–1914) was a married traveling salesman
                    from Springfield, Illinois. He sold agricultural implements for the B. D. Buford
                    Company. Destined to become one of America's first multimillionaires, this
                    pioneer manufacturer, market researcher, and advertising innovator went on to
                    invent and sell the country's first commercial coffee substitute—the early
                    health drink, Postum—and to develop the first dry-pack cereals. He is
                    often credited as the originator of the prepared food industry (Alice Lotvin

                        Whitman Quarterly Review</span> 11 [Summer 1993], 30–31). Whitman had
                    stopped in St. Louis only briefly while going west, but on returning from
                    Denver, he "went on to St. Louis where I remain'd nearly three months with my
                    brother T.J.W. (Thomas Jefferson Whitman), and my dear nieces" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York
