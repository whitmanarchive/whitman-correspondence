            <p class="tei_p">I have been through "Specimen Days and Collect" pretty thoroughly, it is well printed
                and I find remarkably few corrections of any kind required—I enclose a list of
                what I have found. This makes
                about six times that I have read "Democratic Vistas" it is a wonderfull piece of writing, as fine in some
                respects as any thing in L. of G. but of course has not the life, fire, inspiration
                (or whatever you may call it) of such poems as "Song of Myself" "A Song of the Open
                Road" and a good many others, however I now take back entirely what I once said to
                you about "Democratic Vistas" to the effect that some other man might have written
                it. At the present moment I do not believe any other man who ever lived might or
                could have written it any more than any other man could have written
                "Calamus"—I go to Toronto tomorrow on some government business, shall be gone
                a few days, I want to hear from you, how you keep, when you are coming here &amp;c
                &amp;c</p>
