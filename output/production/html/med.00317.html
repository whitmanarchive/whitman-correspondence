                        (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General on July 23, 1866, and
                        served until March 12, 1868, when he resigned to serve as President
                        Johnson's chief counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the
                        conclusion of the trial, Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to
                        confirm him. Failing eyesight—to which Whitman referred in letters

                        Stanbery to retire from legal practice in 1878. Speaking to Horace Traubel
                        in 1888, Whitman affirmed his fondness for Stanbery (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
