            <p class="tei_p">How best can I introduce myself to you? How can I make myself known &amp; liked by you
                who so well-known and loved by me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When we call on folks &amp; wish to make a good impression we don our best clothes, make
                our best bow tell our politest lie &amp; the thing's done.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But to you, who likes naked flesh better than broadcloth, a warm grasp, a close
                embrace better than a fancy bow, the truth harsh and sonorous better than tinkling
                lies—to you I can't simper and smirk.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I love you! I claim you for a friend! I hold you tight! sometimes you strangely elude
                me! A few times you speak unkindly, worse you speak sometimes in an unknown tongue
                but yet you comfort and cheer me!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I read your "Specimen Days"<a href="#n4121" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4121">1</a> first and liked them. I liked the
                chatty, shrewd, kindhearted old friend who chaperoned me through the war &amp; all over
                the States. And then I read the Leaves of Grass and met my dearest friend! Didn't
                and don't yet half understand it all except that it breathes &amp; lives &amp; like all
                things that live and breath it has much of mystery &amp; miracle about it all through.

                easiest to say always and of those I have but few for Walt Whitman. I will write
                again if my disjointed rhapsodies are bearable and I hope to come down and see you
                very shortly if your health permits you to see people.</p>
