                    (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
                    Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
                    Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
                    Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man . . .
                    never satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>). Aldrich visited Whitman at his Camden home
                    numerous times, and he served as a conduit between the poet and William Michael
                    Rossetti in England, who edited the first British edition of Whitman's work. For

                    copy of Whitman's poem "O Captain! My Captain!." The poem, an elegy for Abraham
                    Lincoln, was one of Whitman's most popular, although it was atypical of his
                    verse and style (the rhyme, meter, stanza and refrain are conventional, and the
                    poem makes use of traditional metaphors). "O Captain! My Captain!" was first
                    published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New-York Saturday Press</span> on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00076.html">November 4, 1865</a>, and it was reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to
                        Drum-Taps</span> (1865–1866). For more information on the poem, see

                    furnish Aldrich with a manuscript copy of "O Captain!," for which Aldrich sent
                    the poet $5. Whitman signed the manuscript copy "with best wishes prayers
                    &amp; love for the people of Iowa." The manuscript is still on display at the
                    State Historical Building in Des Moines. See Ed Folsom, "The Mystical
