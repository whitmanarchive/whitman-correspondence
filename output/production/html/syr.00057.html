                6th, Wednesday, he had five of those epileptic seizures, the last four from 5 P. M.
                to 9.30, going from one to another without recovering consciousness. He has not been
                up since, and is very weak and sick, and his mind is not clear yet. Will send word
                again as soon as I can.</p>
