                    Henry Reynolds (b. 1827–before 1880), a car driver, and Eliza Reynolds (b. 1828?). Walter's mother Eliza Reynolds, wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.01828">October 16,
                        1868</a>, imploring Whitman to get to know his namesake. She described Walter as "a nice
                    boy, between 13 and 14 years old" and told the poet: "i thought perhaps you might take an
                    interest in him." Walter Whitman Reynolds wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.01860">February 9, 1870</a>, <a href="loc.01862">April 26,
                            1870</a>, and <a href="loc.01863">May 13, 1872</a>. In his May 1872
                    letter, Reynolds begged Whitman, "friend Walt I want to know if you will be kind
                    enough loan me twenty dollars as I want to get a pair of pants and a coat." If
                    Whitman replied, his letters are not extant. According to Whitman's daybook, his
                    namesake Reynolds visited him on September 1, 1889. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n5002d">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_xml:id_n5002d tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n5002d"><span>This letter has not been
