            <p class="tei_p">I cannot tell you what joy your message has given me, both as proof of your
                improvement and your remembrance. I had feared that you were too ill to look at
                flowers or to identify, even in thoughts, those who think of you. With what joyful
                smiling I thank God that you are better, as I wept<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_sf.00067_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_sf.00067_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_sf.00067_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> from my heart, at hearing of your
                extremity.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In Specimen Days I found that an ancestor of yours settled very early in Weymouth,
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this</span> portion of which where I am now staying was my
                father's native place. I suppose from what I gather, that Whitman's Pond takes its
                name from a branch of your family-tree.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am hoping some day of late summer or early autumn to see you at Camden. If you
                should then be able to say a few words yourself<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_sf.00068_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_sf.00068_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_sf.00068_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and hear me talk a little, without
                exhaustion, the visit would be a satisfaction.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">During your illness I have often wished to tell you what I have said both in public
                and private:—what, in one sense, no other writer of any age, has, in his work,
                laid so far-reaching and sympathetic a grasp on the heart of the future as you
                have done. Hundreds of years hence yes, as long as books last, men will feel on
                reading the Sun-Down Poem and others<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_sf.00069_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_sf.00069_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_sf.00069_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> of like nature, that your very
                existence touches theirs: that your vital presence is with them: and, with what
                comforting confirmation of immortality, will these words meet them:—</p>
