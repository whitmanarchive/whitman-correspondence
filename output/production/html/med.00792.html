            <p class="tei_p"> [I approve of your attempt to translate certain of my poems into the German tongue.
                Indeed, arrogant as the statement may seem, I had more than my own native land in
                view when I was composing Leaves of Grass. I wished to take the first step toward
                calling into existence a cycle of international poems. The chief reason for being of
                the United States of America is to bring about the common good will of all mankind,
                the solidarity of the world. What is still lacking in this respect can perhaps be
                accomplished by the art of poetry, through songs radiating from all the lands of the
                globe. I had also in mind, as one of my objects, to send a hearty greeting to these
                lands in America's name. And glad, very glad, should I be to gain entrance and
                audience among the Germanic peoples.]<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
