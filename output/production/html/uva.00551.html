            <p class="tei_p">Your letter rec'd &amp; welcomed as always—My visit to N Y was a hasty flash only—I am
                more &amp; more wretchedly physically disabled, &amp; feel better off here in my own
                den—the "Anne Gilchrist" book is a wonderfully well done Vol. &amp; interesting very to
                me because I knew &amp; loved Mrs. G—but I doubt whether it contains much (or any
                thing) for you—I can loan you my copy if you wish—I will certainly keep you posted
                ab't myself, or any literary movement or change or happening of my work—</p>
