                not been heard from—when—comes yr card. I had no idea O'C. wd have 'fits' It seems terrible. The letter I sent

                unpleasant surprise. Well this is the worst month in the year. Let us wait patiently
                for god's (nature's) grass &amp; dandelions again. Death is no evil to good or bad.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am reading Browning still; manage to extract considerable from his rubbish; he is a
                great fellow for subtle soul-searchings, &amp; delvings in the past. But I can't <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">heartily love</span> any except <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">our</span> kind of

I suppose you saw the notice that his son—a promising 
                young fellow, 23 or so, committed suicide. Do you suppose it was love &amp; money combined—the
                cause—? He was writing a little for Springfield Republican. Sanborn père
                had a col. in that paper about him, giving extracts from his verse-poems. They
                were real pretty, unusually good, in some respects. Sanborn seems to be having a
                tough time these days. May his philosophy &amp; well stored literary mind stand him well
                now!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Burroughs—has he gone into burrow? In one of his dark mumpish spells, think
                you? He don't answer me. I sent him a ply of new kind of wheat coffee some months
                ago &amp; got a good letter. I send him a Transcript occasionally, with horticultural report. (I can't realize that you
                have been shut up there so long. You are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a hero</span>.
