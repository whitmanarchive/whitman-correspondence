            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am down here for a few days—Came down last Saturday fore-noon—am with folks I love, &amp; that love me—have had a real good old-fashion'd time, first-rate for me—It is a farm, every thing plain &amp; plenty, &amp; blazing wood fires—in the eating line, lots of chickens, eggs, fresh pork &amp;c: (they kill a hog every two weeks)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You ought to be here with me a day or so—(likely one day would be enough <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">for you</span>, as there is no city excitement or fashions—no <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sogering</span>—no balls or theatres—but quite lots of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">gals</span>, &amp; some real nice ones)—I take an old man's liberty of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">kissing them all</span>, (especially the handsome ones) when I go around where they are—as I have been coming down here off &amp; on for nearly two years &amp; have got acquainted—</p>
                   
            <p class="tei_p">I go out walking a good deal down a lane &amp; by a beautiful pond &amp; creek I am very fond of—spend two or three hours there first-rate, even this weather, all by myself—I am quite happy here for me—the weather was very fine for two days, but is a little cooler to-day—I can't walk far you know, but I go stumping about &amp; enjoy it—yesterday they took me out on a long ride—went through the piney woods, which I always like—Jack, I thought you might like to get a line from me, from here—Every thing is so different from Market st or Chestnut or Penn st—but there is no difference in your loving old friend &amp; comrade</p>
