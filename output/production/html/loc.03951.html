                <span class="tei_salute">My noble and dear friend—Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had the pleasure of talking for you, and of you again. Yes—and a deep interest was aroused. It was good to hear 
                the listener say—"I promise you—I will read him now." One man—fine—true and scholarly and sincere took my 
                hand and said: "I am converted."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Bless you—dear soul! Is it not good to have Truth for a theme?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How I want to see you and talk with you. That few minutes—was so much to me—yet it was so short. 
                For years I have longed to sit beside you and have wondered how it would be. Then—when it came—it was so different 
                from my fancies—but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> dear friend, were not disappointing.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Can you make a few strokes of your pen for me—just as a proof that the hand is no weaker than when I took it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I don't know just what to send that shall give you comfort or pleasure. Flowers fade soon. 
                Please have something that you want—and play that I sent it, instead of this unbeautiful Money Order.</p>

                    née Pearsons, was a socialite and active member of various reform movements
                    and women's clubs. She served as the President of the Home Club of East Boston
                    and was a member of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. She married
                    Ebenezer Spaulding, an Assistant Surgeon during the Civil War, and, later, a
                    homeopathic physician and surgeon who practiced in Boston. Ada Spaulding read
                    and admired Whitman's poetry, visited the poet, and wrote a number of letters to
                    him in his final years. For more on Spaulding, see Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="https://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol9/iss3/4/">Women's Letters to Walt
