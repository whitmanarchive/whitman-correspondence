                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been in London this fortnight &amp; more now, &amp; have completely settled at
                last in this quiet, old-fashioned little street behind Westminster Abbey. From Wales
                I went to Somersetshire—to King Arthur's Vale of Avallon, for a week; then to
                Liverpool, to lecture on "The Modern Novel,"—on the whole I think the best
                lecture I have given yet. The practice I had in America, &amp; the vocal exercises
                that I used to indulge in during my mountain rambles in Wales this fall, seemed to
                have given me greater power &amp; ease of locution. &amp;c. Ten days ago another
                chance to lecture cropped up unexpectedly, in the place of a sick man, before a
                large audience of working men,—chiefly socialists; so I gave them as good an
                account of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> in connection with my visits to
                you &amp; to America generally as I could at an hour or two's notice. To my great
                delight, there proved to be several men there who knew L. of G. &amp; who were able
                to join with good effect in the discussion afterwards. Again last night I was asked
                to go to a society's meeting where a paper on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span>
                would be read, by William Clarke,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> a young lecturer &amp; journalist, &amp;
                a very able paper it proved to be. During its delivery who should come in but Mrs.
                Costelloe,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> with Evelyn Nordhoff,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> &amp; after the paper, Mrs. C. joined in the discussion, speaking with wonderful
                ease &amp; grace, &amp; in fact rather casting into the shade the efforts of the
                rest of us. Shortly<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03335.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03335.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03335.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03335.002.jpg</span>
                afterwards, Mrs. C &amp; Miss N. had to go, &amp; I saw them into a hansom, not
                expecting of course to see them again; but when an hour later or so I was sauntering
                home, red glare in the sky in the direction of Grosvenor Road, but on the opposite
                side of the river, &amp; the sound of fire-bells &amp; galloping horses in the
                distance, drew me out of my way. On reaching Lambeth Bridge, I found Doulton's great
                pottery had caught fire in one of its buildings &amp; was making a fine blaze, right
                opposite Costelloe's; &amp; I went along then, expecting to find some of them on the
                balcony watching the spectacle. They had not seen it however, &amp; were glad to
                come out to Lambeth Bridge where we stood till the fire was got under. The effect of
                the red glare on the water, with the black barges shooting by, &amp; the river
                fire-engine's steaming up, was singularly striking, especially in contrast with the
                pale, cold moon which shone on the other side. Altogether a wonderful scene!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">After being so long in the quiet of the mountains, you can imagine how these
                excitements of town affect one. Here in Westminster, I am in a capital situation for
                making the most of what London can give one of a healthy &amp; helpful kind. Charing
                Cross is only a short walk distant, with the Strand &amp; its theatres &amp; crowded
                pavements. The river is almost at the back-door, or at any rate only a short street
                away; so that I have the ferries close at hand, &amp; trains &amp; busses are
                equally handy. My American trip seems to have given me a new energy of assimilation
                too. Never before were all the sights &amp; sounds of London so full of suggestion;
                I think you must have unwittingly given me some of your power of co-ordinating
                imaginatively the everyday experiences of the crowd &amp; the life of the streets.
                (By the way, have you seen 'The Century' for Decr.? There's a vivid account of
                London by Hy. James,<a href="#n2001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2001">4</a> with clever sketches by Jo. Pennell,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> which gives a very true impression of the whole thing.) And
                now I must stop for to-day, for I have a great deal of work to get through. Don't
                forget about the promised <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Novr. Boughs</span><a href="#n3999" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3999">6</a> &amp; the collected
                complete works,<a href="#n4188" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4188">7</a> which I want to review immediately! </p>
