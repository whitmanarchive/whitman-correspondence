            <p class="tei_p">The sun is out again after three days—good temperature, neither hot nor cold
                to-day—I neither <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">improve</span> nor really go
                back—Keep my room rigidly yet—have had today a bowel
                movement—&amp; sit up most of the time—eat my meals
                    sufficiently—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">take no brain grip</span> (real writing,
                reading, examining proofs) definitely yet, (nor any thing like it plainly as of
                old)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I will very soon send proof pages onward following from "Sands at Seventy" for
                proof pieces of ab't 50 pages further—(you have now ab't 40 proof
                pages)—Of course I have for all June <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">stopp'd</span>
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">writing the Herald bits</span>—&amp; the H. paper ceases by mail wh' is
                just as satisfactory—I have written, formally completed &amp;c. the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">will document</span> (witnessed by ocular witnesses as this state
                statute requires) and the designation of my copyrights to be supervised by you,
                Harned and Horace Traubel—&amp; now when "Nov. Boughs" are completed—all
                will be attended to, the same—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Feeling miserably to-day so far—am sitting up—not rain but cloudy and
                cool and raw—bad feeling in belly and head regions, all day so far—had
                the preluded coca-wine, &amp; then my breakfast, moderate—pretty good
                spirits—Mrs Davis has been up ten minutes, good company, good gossip—a
                pretty rose-bouquet from Agnes Traubel—Tom Harned ret'd last evn'g from NY
                three days (likes NY much)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I am wretchedly weak in knees &amp; anything like <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">body strength</span>—tho pretty good arm muscular hold as I
                hold on—</p>
