                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's

                        Earlier that year, January 23, 1888, O'Connor had described one of his
                        attacks for Bucke:</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">"My state of health is exasperating. Everyone says I look very well and I
                        feel reasonably so but for the horrible lameness and feebleness. Last Monday
                        (the 16<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>) I had a new experience. I sat down to
                        dinner, suddenly felt a curious <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">still</span> feeling,
                        pushed back my chair, and became perfectly insensible. It was then five
                        o'clock in the afternoon. When I came to it was ten. The room was lighted,
                        and four doctors were around me, and my wife and a couple of neighbors. I
                        thought I had died, did not know where I was, and for about an hour could
                        not articulate. Then I began to realize I was still in the world, and began
                        a resolute effort to have three or four messages written for me, for I
                        tranquilly thought I was dying. I succeeded, and was then helped up stairs
                        and put to bed, where I remained for the rest of the week. It was a tough of
                        apoplexy, incident to my malady the doctor said, and a small blood vessel in
                        my head had broken. Now I am no worse than usual, save that I am very
                        feeble; and I go to the office, though I can't do much." (See the letter

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
