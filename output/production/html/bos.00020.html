            <p class="tei_p">We have had eight days of persistent obtrusive sun, glare &amp; heat —but as I
                write it is a cloudy forenoon ("for this relief much thanks") though still &amp;
                warm—I am still here in Mickle Street—at this moment sitting by the open
                window down stairs in my big arm-chair—H[erbert] G[ilchrist] at work at the portrait (now near finished)—Loving
                remembrance to you all—to your father and A[lys]—I am writing a little—not much—</p>
