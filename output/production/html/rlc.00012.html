      <p class="tei_p">Yours<a href="#n0793" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0793">1</a> of June 26<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> duly arrived some days
        since. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">1) I have sent a paper to Kr. Elster<a href="#n0216" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0216">3</a> at Throudhjem, containing my
        last, (the College poem) &amp; a piece in about my sickness. I sent you a copy same paper. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">2) The letter you speak of, (March 20,) duly reached me. I have no doubt, dear friend, that
        all the letters, papers, sheets, &amp;c. during the last three years sent me by your loving
        kindness &amp; attention have every one reached me. (The post office here is among the best
        things of the New World—is sure, quick, cheap, &amp; every way admirable. If letters
        addressed to me go to other cities, as they sometimes do, they are pretty sure eventually to
        come <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span>—the post office men, even the carriers, are
        wonderfully bright &amp; intuitive.) </p>

      <p class="tei_p">3) I will be on the look out for John Burroughs's photograph—he is well at last
        accounts. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">4) I myself have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pleased myself</span> more fully with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Redwood Tree</span><a href="#n0578" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0578">4</a> than any of my pieces of late years.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> But it
        is generally thought wild &amp; cloudy here—(the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Columbus</span> is
        more popular far)—I suppose it is hardly necessary to tell you that I have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pitched</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">keyed</span> my pieces more with reference
        to fifty years hence, &amp; how they will stand mellowed and toned <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">then</span>—than to pleasing &amp; tickling the immediate impressions of the present
        hour. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">6)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a> I have not heard any thing more of C. Petersen
        lately—but if I meet with any thing of his printed, I will send you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">7) All the criticisms, Danish papers, &amp; those from Norway, duly rec'd—to be carefully translated &amp; read to me—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I prize
          them all, very much</span>—but I am yet feeble, &amp; read, write &amp;c. as little as
        possible. 8) One or two little items have been in the papers here about the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fremblik</span> translation. I get along with your English very well
        indeed—</p>

        <p class="tei_p">Your letter of July 28, from Gaûsdal,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> in "old Norway"
          reached me to-day. Quite curiously, on the very same day, I was writing to you—as per sheet
          accompanying, written at date (a month ago) but not sent until I could add further. I am
          glad to get your letter from Norway—am still laid up sick &amp; lonesome
          here—do not seem to get any thing like well, &amp; at times the prospect is very
          uncertain—yet maintain a steady heart. I was dismissed from my clerkship under
          Government at Washington about two months ago. I write this by my open window—the
          majestic &amp; beautiful Delaware flows near, in sight—we have had a fine summer in
          America—&amp; now a spell of rich, golden, mellow weather—far &amp; near
          wonderful crops of every thing—now beginning to be gathered. </p>

                    wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
