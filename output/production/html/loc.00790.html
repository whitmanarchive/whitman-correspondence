               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Comrade,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write you a few lines &amp; see if they would reach you—I was very much disappointed when I went to Armory that evening to find my dear comrade was gone so sudden &amp; unexpected.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thuey, did you take the envelope you had with my address?—if you did why have you not written to me, comrade?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What kind of accommodations have you at Carlisle, Thu, &amp; how is the foot? I want to hear all about it—If you get this you must write to me, Thu, you need not mind ceremony—there is no need of ceremony between dear friends for that I hope we are, my loving boy, for all the difference in our ages.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new with me here—I am very well in health &amp; spirits, &amp; only need some employment, clerkship or something, at fair wages to make things go agreeable with me—no, there is one thing more I need &amp; that is Thuey, for I believe I am quite a fool, I miss you so.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, Thu, it seems as though they were moving again in front—Pleasonton has been advancing &amp; fighting—he had all the cavalry moving, had quite a fight last Sunday, driving Stuart—a good many wounded were brought here very late Monday night 12 o'clock—some 70 to Armory Hospital—all cavalry. In Ward A things go on the same—I dont go as often there as I did—Pyne &amp; I went on quite a spree Monday, went to the mystic Varieties &amp; elsewhere, (saw the ghost as they call it)—had an oyster supper, ale, &amp;c. quite a time—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well I will not write any more this time—so good bye for present, Thuey, &amp; I pray God bless you, my dear loving comrade, &amp; I hope he will bring us together again—good by, dear boy, from your true friend—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thuey, I enclose an envelope but will write my address here too for future—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Thuey, you went away without getting paid, aint you broke? I can send you a little, a few 10ct bills, my darling—You write to me, Thu, just how it is—you need not be afraid, my darling comrade—it is little, but it may be some use—Thuey, you write to me just as you would to your own older brother—
