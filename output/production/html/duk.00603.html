                <span class="tei_salute">My dear dear Walt</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">i sat down and
            let every thing go to write this it seems
            so long since i have written to you
            well georgey came home on saturday
                and went back on sunday and matt
            and the children went back with him
            he insisted when he first came home on
            saturday on their going but i think he got
            rather sorry he did before they started
            i think he wished matt to go but the children
            was so noisey he got sick of his bargain
                if i had felt well i wouldent let them
                go i hope matty will like her)
                but its very
                evedent she will be boss george has spent
            700 dollars for his house i think he will not
            add much to his bank book) i know walt
            you will say mother is childish but
            walt there is such a difference when he
            used to come home he would ask me if i
            wanted any thing when he went down town
            saturday but it was so different this time</p>
            <p class="tei_p">burn this letter up</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00603.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00603.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00603.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">when he was going away he asked me
                if i dident want some money i said i
            would like to have a little as matt had
            used her money all the time she had been
            here he gave me six dollars) he makes
            14 dollars and over per day) but walt there is no
            knowing what or how a man may change
            when he gets married george is certainly
            the last one you would think as he
            always was set in his way) but as you
            say by my putting a bed in the front
            room wonders will never cease
            
            
            
            i got your letter walter dear and
            the money order was glad to have it

                she said aint
            uncle walt good) the children is very
            noisey and wild but matt is so kind
            to me i put up with it all) when matt
