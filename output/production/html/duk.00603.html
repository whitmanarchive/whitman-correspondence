                        between March 7 and May 15, 1871. On an accompanying slip of paper held in
                        the Trent Collection (not reproduced here), Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
                        letter March 1871 with a note that George Washington Whitman, who married in
                        "March '71," spent $700 on his house and is already living in Camden,
                        New Jersey at the time of the letter. </p>
                    <p class="tei_p">George probably married Louisa Orr Haslam on March 14, 1871 (see Walt
                        Whitman, "Marriages," Missouri Historical Society, reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span>, ed.
                        Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1984], 27; and see H.
                        Stanley Craig, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden County New Jersey Marriages,
                            1837–1910: Records Filed in the Office of the County Clerk</span>
                        [Merchantville, New Jersey: H. Stanley Craig, 1932], 133). A March date for
                        George's marriage conflicts with Whitman scholarly consensus, that he
                        married Louisa Orr on April 14, 1871 (see Richard Maurice Bucke, "Genealogy
                        of Whitman Family," Trent Collection, Duke University, reprinted in Gay
                        Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York:
                        Macmillan, 1955], 596). But because March 14 is both in Walt Whitman's hand
                        and is derived independently from the records assembled by Craig, March 14
                        for the date of George's marriage is likely correct. Martha Mitchell
                        "Mattie" Whitman and daughters arrived in Brooklyn no earlier than February
                        14 but perhaps several days later (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00609">February 9, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman).
                        Another letter that may corroborate the March marriage is Louisa's <a href="duk.00608">March 19?–May 14?, 1871</a> letter to Walt.
                        If a March 14 marriage date for George and Louisa Orr Haslam is assumed, and
                        Mattie's family began their five- or six-week visit to Brooklyn and Camden
                        in late February, this letter dates to just before the marriage (March 7?)
                        or just after it (March 15–17?). The latest possible date for this
                        letter can be inferred from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's expectation that
                        Mattie Whitman will report to Walt about Brooklyn after she returns "home,"
                        possibly to Brooklyn unless Mattie is returning to St. Louis directly from
                        Camden. Mattie and family may be en route to St. Louis, or they may be
                        visiting George and Louisa Orr near their marriage date. Louisa's next
                        extant letter to Walt, <a href="duk.00607">June 13, 1871</a>, refers
                        to St. Louis but not to Mattie's recent visit, so Mattie and family had
                        returned to St. Louis by mid-May.</p><p class="tei_p">To summarize, this letter could date
                        to some days before George and Louisa's marriage (March 7?), to just after
                        their marriage (March 15–17?), or to just before the return of Mattie
                        and daughters to St. Louis (March 30–May 14?). If Louisa's <a href="duk.00608">March 19?–May 14?, 1871</a> letter dates
                        April 30, the latest possible date for this letter is a week or two after
                        that letter, from May 7 to May 15, 1871. However, this letter is likely to
                        date earlier, to just after Mattie and daughters visit George and Louisa Orr
                        in Camden near their marriage.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    Whitman has named the wrong periodical. The spelling "graphe" more likely refers
