            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Every thing here goes on pretty much the same with me. My health has been good since I last saw you. 
                It is very monotonous here, &amp; I sometimes feel like pulling up stakes in desperation—Abby, I have little to write about, only I wanted to write you something—I hear from you occasionally 
                by mother's letters—What a good girl Helen is, to go and make those nice calls on mother<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I am grateful to her for so doing, 
                &amp; hope she will continue always—the same good affectionate Helen—&amp; indeed I am sure she always will be—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is very hot weather here—to-day it is 96 or '7—I am sitting here at my desk in the office—there is quite a breeze pouring in the window, but it is a warm wind—half our clerks are away on vacation. I shall leave Washington soon after the middle of August—then I will see you all, &amp; we will have some good talks.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Good bye, dear Abby—I send my love to Emily,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; all—The O'Connors are well—Jenny<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> grows like every thing.
