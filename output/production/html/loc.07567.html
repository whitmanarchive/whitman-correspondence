                room. Situation much the same &amp; am ceasing to count for any thing seriously
                better—(only hug myself on the tho't it might be &amp; has been much
                worse)—Sunny to day, &amp; markedly cold—I have a good wood

                the French <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nouvelle Revue</span> of May last—I shall 
                send you &amp; Dr B. copies of the German
                book soon as I get them—Have rec'd Wilson's
                (publisher's) letter—I shouldn't wonder if he has
                been a little frighten'd by Alex: Gardner of Paisley, who had a
                small ed'n of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nov: Boughs</span> (I hear we
                have quite a clientage in Scotland)—I have sent the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Complete Works</span> Vol. to Rolleston
                by mail—McKay has rec'd several orders, &amp; is waiting
                for the better binding—I guess the N B has done &amp; is doing fairly
                publisherially—have just had a short visit from two young deaf mutes f'm
                Washington D C—Am feeling comfortable—I will keep you posted, &amp; you
                must me—</p>
