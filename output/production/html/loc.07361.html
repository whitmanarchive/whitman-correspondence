                &amp; money help $25 which came safely to-day—Every thing is going on here
                much the same—Mrs. D[avis] is well &amp; busy—&amp; I sit

                Ernest Rhys here soon. Morse the
                sculptor is still here. Mr Eakins the portrait painter, of Phila:, is going to have
