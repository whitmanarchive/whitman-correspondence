            <p class="tei_p">I intended to write to you last Tuesday evening for Wednesday's mail, but was

            <p class="tei_p">And now that I write I have little to tell. I have seen nothing of the

            <p class="tei_p">I caught a little cold on my voyage home,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> &amp; my outdoor work since
                my return home has added another to it, which at present confines me
                to the house.—But it is of no great consequence beyond its
                present annoyance.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">We are having a touch of Winter just now—snowfalls, frosty nights,
                fog, strong winds heavy rain &amp;c alternating. At the present moment
                3-10 Saturday afternoon it is fair I think, though it has been wet
                all morning, &amp; is dark &amp; overclouded.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a postcard from D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. Johnston<a href="#n4102" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4102">4</a> this morning &amp; expect him
                here soon—if he can get.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to receive your postal of the 15<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span><a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a>
                &amp; thank you for it. Yes, indeed, my trip <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">was</span>
                "satisfactory" to me, &amp; more than satisfactory in every way. I
                shall thank God for it while I live.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And apart from other gains (&amp; the greatest) I feel that I have
                gained in health &amp; strength from it, too, though I expect to
                realize this more in the coming months than I do now.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01940_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01940_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01940_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.01940_large.jpg</span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Of course I have several things to attend to on my return &amp;
                hardly feel settled down yet into my ordinary course. Hence,
                mainly, the brevity &amp; poverty of my letters at present.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">One result of my trip has been—not only to confirm my
                affection &amp; reverence for yourself—but to give it
                a firmer sense of actuality now that I have seen you
                &amp; talked with you. How much it means to me in all this I cannot
                tell you. But it is a constant encouragement &amp; stimulus
                &amp; joy in the battle of life.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter the other day from a friend in which he expressed
                his diffidence about writing to you (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">he</span>—"a mere pigmy") 
                even to thank you for your kindnesses to him
                &amp; to the College. I replied that if he knew you better his
                diffidence would leave him. For it was the lesson of your
                personal presence &amp; influence—as well as of L
                of G.—that he was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> a
                pigmy—&amp; that the gradations of intellect, virtue,
                station &amp;c are of small account compared with the

                all simple human traits, &amp; especially all honest affection

            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for my own lesson. I thank you, with a full

                    returned from two months of travel in Europe, where he had spent time with
                    Johnston, Wallace, and the Bolton College group of English Whitman admirers.
                    Both Bucke and Wallace visited Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days
                    with the poet, Wallace returned with Bucke to London, Ontario, Canada, where he
                    met Bucke's family and friends. Wallace's account of his time with Whitman was
                    published—along with the Bolton physician John Johnston's account of his
                    own visit with the poet in the summer of 1890—in their memoir, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
