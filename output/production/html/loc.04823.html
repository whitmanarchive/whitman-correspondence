                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I intended to write to you last Tuesday evening for Wednesday's mail, but was
                kept busy all the evening with business matters &amp; had to let it go.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And now that I write I have little to tell. I have seen nothing of the
                College friends since I last wrote &amp; have no very special news.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01938_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01938_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01938_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I caught a little cold on my voyage home, &amp; my outdoor work since
                my return home has added another to it, which at present confines me
                to the house.—But it is of no great consequence beyond its
                present annoyance.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">We are having a touch of Winter just now—snowfalls, frosty nights,
                fog, strong winds heavy rain &amp;c alternating. At the present moment
                3-10 Saturday afternoon it is fair I think, though it has been wet
                all morning, &amp; is dark &amp; overclouded.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01939_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01939_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01939_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I had a postcard from D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. Johnston this morning &amp; expect him
                here soon—if he can get.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to receive your postal of the 15<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>
                &amp; thank you for it. Yes, indeed, my trip <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">was</span>
                "satisfactory" to me, &amp; more than satisfactory in every way. I
                shall thank God for it while I live.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And apart from other gains (&amp; the greatest) I feel that I have
                gained in health &amp; strength from it, too, though I expect to
                realize this more in the coming months than I do now.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01940_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01940_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01940_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Of course I have several things to attend to on my return &amp;
                hardly feel settled down yet into my ordinary course. Hence,
                mainly, the brevity &amp; poverty of my letters at present.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">One result of my trip has been—not only to confirm my
                affection &amp; reverence for yourself—but to give it
                a firmer sense of actuality now that I have seen you
                &amp; talked with you. How much it means to me in all this I cannot
                tell you. But it is a constant encouragement &amp; stimulus
                &amp; joy in the battle of life.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01941_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01941_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01941_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
           
            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter the other day from a friend in which he expressed
                his diffidence about writing to you (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">he</span>—"a mere pigmy") 
                even to thank you for your kindnesses to him
                &amp; to the College. I replied that if he knew you better his
                diffidence would leave him. For it was the lesson of your
                personal presence &amp; influence—as well as of L
                of G.—that he was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> a
                pigmy—&amp; that the gradations of intellect, virtue,
                station &amp;c are of small account compared with the
                humanity—&amp; all it holds &amp; implies—that
                we all share, &amp; the future development that awaits us all.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01942_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01942_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01942_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I told him that before all things else you were 
                a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">man</span>—that this included &amp;
                was greater than all special merits,—&amp; that therefore
                all simple human traits, &amp; especially all honest affection
                &amp; goodwill were welcome to you.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for my own lesson. I thank you, with a full
                heart for all your loving kindness—as simple &amp;
                spontaneous as it was great &amp; true—to
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span>. And, please God, I will try
                at least to practice &amp; incarnate some of the lessons
                I have learned.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01943_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01943_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01943_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J. did not come but sent a telegram saying that he was
                detained &amp; will come tomorrow.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope that you are having fairly good days and nights. I fear
                that you will not be able to go out now, though I hope to hear
                that you were able to avail yourself of the Indian Summer.</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">I look forward, however, with cheerfulness &amp; hope to the spring
                &amp; summer. Though you report as time goes on that you
                occasionally find another peg dropped,
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01944_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01944_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01944_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                yet your condition seems to me on the whole to justify hope.
                You have a good deal of strength &amp; vitality, &amp; I am
                clear that, barring accidents, you have a fair lease
                yet.—May your remaining days be as comfortable as may
                be, and above the low-lying mists of physical weakness
                &amp; suffering your spiritual skies more radiant &amp; clear.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Love to you, my dearest friend, &amp; best benefactor, from
                my heart. And may God bless you.</p>
