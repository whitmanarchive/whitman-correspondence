                    Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was one of Whitman's
                    earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake:
                        A Critical Essay</span> (1868), Swinburne pointed out similarities between
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His
                    famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs

                    Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
                    Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
                    between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
                    Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
                    treatment of Hannah. Louisa wrote, "if heyde was kind to her she would get well"
                    (see her <a href="tex.00340">November 11–14, 1868</a> letter to

                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
