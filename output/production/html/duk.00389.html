         <p class="tei_p">I have sent to you the "Galaxy"; It contains two articles, one on Whitman and one on Swinburne,—I have read both criticisms, with great satisfaction. Richard Grant White has but paid just sympathy to a true poet "Swinburne"; The criticism
            is a "Poem," in itself. It has the <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_smb tei_supplied_cert_high">c</span>omprehensiveness, and the fearless recognition <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_smb tei_supplied_cert_high">of</span> 
            the divine idea, or sentiment <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_smb tei_supplied_cert_high">of</span> "Love," as expressed by the Poet, he writes
            upon—Swinburne electrifies me. I read one verse of his "Laus Veneris," in a store,
            and bought the book—When critics or ordinary readers, or writers scribble him
