        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Well here I am still, pretty much the same thing, doing nothing &amp; taking things easy.
        By your letter I see that you too are jogging along about the same, on your car, with an
        occasional let up—Often in my jaunts around the city, or on the bay, I wish you were
        with me, as you would enjoy it much—I have seen Mr. Hart,
        formerly of the Chronicle—he is about the same in appearance as formerly—Pete, I
        will not write much this time, as I am feeling somewhat dull and stupid this
        forenoon—We had a fine shower last night, and there is some breeze—but it is
        pretty warm and oppressive—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pete, here is a loving kiss for you, dear son, and much, much love for you, as ever, from
        your affectionate comrade &amp; father—</p>
