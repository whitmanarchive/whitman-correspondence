                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Darling Walt:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I read your long piece in the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> with ever so much interest, &amp; with especial delight the delicately told bit about the dear old Pond, artistic, because so true.<a href="#n3011" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3011">2</a> I know that it will please you to hear that I have gained tenfold facility with my brush since the autumn. It has agreed uncommonly well with me having enlisted under such an experienced &amp; able painter as Chase;<a href="#n1510" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1510">3</a> as a manipulator of the brush he is agreed by the experts (Eaton)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> to have no rival. I may yet be able to paint a head of you in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">one</span> sitting that will do justice to you. Three of my pictures are nicely hung at the Water Colour Exhibition Academy of Design, the first time that I have exhibited in New York. We had two &amp; three engagements every night (with one exception) last week, &amp; go to Mrs. Croley's to-night. Your friend John Burroughs<a href="#n0129" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0129">5</a> called last Wednesday—came to try Turkish baths for his malarious trouble, but it seemed to bring on his attacks of neuralgia worse. I am sorry that I can report but poorly of his health, so painfully excruciating was his neuralgia about his arms at times that a Dr. was sent for &amp; morphia injected in his wrist, but I am glad to say he reported himself a little better. He hopes that you will come and give the lecture on Lincoln this winter; why not, confound it, it would be most interesting.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Quite often we go to Miss Booth's<a href="#n3017" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3017">6</a> receptions. Saturday evening, they are gay &amp; amusing. Met Mr. Bliss, the gentleman that talked like "a house afire" one Sunday at your house last winter, you remember.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Last Wednesday I, mother, Giddy,<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">7</a> &amp; Kate Hillard<a href="#n0302" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0302">8</a> went to Mrs. Bigelow's<a href="#n1509" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1509">9</a> reception. Miss H. was asked to recite &amp; she recited the "Swineherd" (<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Anderson​ </span></span>'s)<a href="#n0041" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0041">10</a> charmingly, &amp; "The Faithful Lovers," which took every one. "Walk in" Miller<a href="#n0412" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0412">11</a> was there (I can't spell his name) &amp; lots more.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">This morning being Sunday, I took my skates to the Park. The wind was high &amp; whirled us about fantastically; ladies seated in wicker chairs were pushed rapidly along the Pond's smooth icy surface by their gentlemen escorts, tall men kissed the ice or sprawled full length on their backs, while others flew by like swallows; all this with a church spire peeping behind hills dappled with snow &amp; sunshine: what more inspiriting than this?</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And now dear Walt.</p>
                     
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Good-bye for the present.</span>

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
                    Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
                    writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his <a href="duk.00657">June 23,
                        1873</a>, letter to his friend, the former publisher and fellow clerk Charles Eldridge. Hillard and Whitman first met in

                    Conway, who acted as Whitman's agent in England, quoted from a letter he had received

                    discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that I never
                    half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed it.
                    To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
