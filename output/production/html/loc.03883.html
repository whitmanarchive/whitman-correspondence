            <p class="tei_p">Cloudy &amp; rain &amp; dark weather to-day &amp; looks like snow out—has been
                a rather gloomy week past with me—my dear brother Jeff
                died last Tuesday at St Louis, had typhoid pneumonia but was over the worst of it,
                &amp; then some heart attack which proved mortal—Jessie
                the daughter was here, &amp; hurried back first train, but he died before she got
                there—she was very low &amp; sick several days, but at last acct's was getting
                better &amp; they think will pull through. Your Ed (dear young
                man) was in to see me a few evn'g's ago &amp; I wish he w'd come oftener, I am here
                alone most of the time in wheel chair a little yesterday
                &amp; day before too, but it is rather dull, at best—(folks don't know how
                rich they are in even being able to walk)—I am writing a little (to order) for
                publication—am shaping a little 2d annex for L of G. you 
                know it has one already—this is to be the 2d &amp; last—Col.
                    Ingersoll's lect: is being
                printed in a small book in N Y, &amp; I will send you one—sell my books to
                purchasers once in a while (sold one to-day)—Hope George
                gets better &amp; stronger—write soon &amp; tell me ab't him, &amp; w'd like
                to send him something for Christmas present—And my dear Harry O how I
                wish we were near enough for me to have him with
                me every day—I am getting more helpless than ever in legs and
                ankles—only my right arm keeps good fortunately—have catarrh of bowels
                in addition to other troubles—am sitting here as usual in den in big cane chair
                with old wolf-skin back—Remembrances to you &amp; George, &amp; to Ed &amp;
                Harry &amp; Deb &amp; Van &amp; Jo—&amp; Jane too if she is
                there—</p>
