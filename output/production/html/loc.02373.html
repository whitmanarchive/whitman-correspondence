                and he asked me to send you his love and hearty greetings 
                and say that he hopes to be able to see you while in America,
                but as his engagements are so numerous he cannot positively 
                promise himself the pleasure. 
                I wish I might myself give you the special hand grasp

                    Whitman: "Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his life. They

                    York City"; Pond concludes with an anecdote about the poet's meeting with Sir

                    was a British poet and journalist best known for his long narrative poem, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> (1879), which tells the life story and
                    philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely responsible for introducing
                    Buddhism to Western audiences. Arnold visited Whitman in Camden in 1889. For an
                    account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.158.html">Friday, September 13, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.159.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering," Whitman
                    concluded. Arnold published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and Lands</span> (1891), in which he averred that the two
                    read from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis,
                    knitting, a handsome young man (Ned Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at
                    least two additional accounts of Arnold's visit with Whitman; "Arnold and
                    Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Times</span>

Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
                    Miller (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.31.html"> Tuesday, August 14, 1888</a>). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).
