            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">This is rather late I am afraid to wish you a Merry Christmas—or even a happy
                New Year—but I had forgotten all about Christmas till it was on me. I have
                come here to Switzerland to have a little winter, such as one gets in America, the
                winter in England is a poor affair generally, but I see in the papers that it is
                cold enough there now. My family live happily in London, though it is always fog
                there when there is frost—I should think they would choke, but they seem to
                like it. But I don't, so<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00160_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00160_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00160_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00160_large.jpg</span> I packed up my books and came here. In summer Grindelwald is one
                of the most crowded of the Swiss places but now, in the winter there are only a few
                people, almost all English, who came here for the skating and coasting. We are in a
                    hole, surrounded
                by tremendous mountains, and the sun has not yet got high enough to shine in yet.
                The wind never blows, but we have day after day of clear cold weather, when one
                feels so well and strung. We have a very jolly party—five or six people from
                Oxford—a master from one of the great English schools with one of his boys, an
                English member of Parliament or two, and several ladies.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The Costelloes<a href="#n7006" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7006">1</a> have gone to Italy and Alys<a href="#n7014" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7014">2</a> with them, and
                they write that they are having a most delightful time there among the churches and
                pictures. Alys is going to stay on a month &amp; learn Italian &amp; then in
                February she is going to Sicily with my mother.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The "Parnell Crisis"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> has been the one great topic of late. At first we feared that
                Home Rule was dead,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> but now, since the election at Kilkenny, things are 
                looking<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00161_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00161_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00161_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00161_large.jpg</span> better, and it
                may not be so bad after all. But it has been most exciting—certainly the Irish
                make politics dramatic. It always seems to be the unexpected that occurs. Mrs.
                    Costelloe does a great deal of speaking, and is
                getting quite a name.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How did you like the American elections?<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">5</a> I was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">delighted</span> it
                seems to me that the time has come for the Republicans to go. All my American
                friends—young men who have gone in for politics—are working with the
                Democratic party.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your books were so much appreciated in Oxford, and that great one you sent my father
                is certainly a royal book. Are you writing anything else?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish I had got this letter off in time to wish you a happy Christmas—but you
                must accept my somewhat tardy letter as if it had come earlier.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

                    Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief
                    organizer. She attended Bryn Mawr College and was a graduate of the class of
                    1890. She and her family lived in Britain for two years during her childhood and
                    again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
                    chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
                    St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
                    to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
                    educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
                    Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
                    (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom

                    Parnell, the Leader of Irish Parliamentary Party, as a co-respondent in divorce
                    proceedings. Parnell had a long-lasting affair with O'Shea's his wife Katharine
                    O'Shea, and there was considerable fear that the scandal would jeopardize

                    reference to the Irish Home Rule movement that advocated for self-government for
                    Ireland within the United Kingdom. Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891) was
                    an Irish Nationalist Politician, Leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and a
                    Member of Parliament. The First Home Rule Bill, to which Parnell reacted with a
                    mix of support and critique, was defeated in the House of Commons in 1886. For
