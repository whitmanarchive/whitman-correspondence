                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">This is rather late I am afraid to wish you a Merry Christmas—or even a happy
                New Year—but I had forgotten all about Christmas till it was on me. I have
                come here to Switzerland to have a little winter, such as one gets in America, the
                winter in England is a poor affair generally, but I see in the papers that it is
                cold enough there now. My family live happily in London, though it is always fog
                there when there is frost—I should think they would choke, but they seem to
                like it. But I don't, so<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00160_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00160_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00160_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I packed up my books and came here. In summer Grindelwald is one
                of the most crowded of the Swiss places but now, in the winter there are only a few
                people, almost all English, who came here for the skating and coasting. We are in a
                    hole, surrounded
                by tremendous mountains, and the sun has not yet got high enough to shine in yet.
                The wind never blows, but we have day after day of clear cold weather, when one
                feels so well and strung. We have a very jolly party—five or six people from
                Oxford—a master from one of the great English schools with one of his boys, an
                English member of Parliament or two, and several ladies.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The Costelloes have gone to Italy and Alys with them, and
                they write that they are having a most delightful time there among the churches and
                pictures. Alys is going to stay on a month &amp; learn Italian &amp; then in
                February she is going to Sicily with my mother.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The "Parnell Crisis" has been the one great topic of late. At first we feared that
                Home Rule was dead, but now, since the election at Kilkenny, things are 
                looking<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00161_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00161_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00161_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> better, and it
                may not be so bad after all. But it has been most exciting—certainly the Irish
                make politics dramatic. It always seems to be the unexpected that occurs. Mrs.
                    Costelloe does a great deal of speaking, and is
                getting quite a name.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How did you like the American elections? I was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">delighted</span> it
                seems to me that the time has come for the Republicans to go. All my American
                friends—young men who have gone in for politics—are working with the
                Democratic party.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your books were so much appreciated in Oxford, and that great one you sent my father
                is certainly a royal book. Are you writing anything else?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish I had got this letter off in time to wish you a happy Christmas—but you
                must accept my somewhat tardy letter as if it had come earlier.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">  
                <span class="tei_salute">ever yours with love</span>
