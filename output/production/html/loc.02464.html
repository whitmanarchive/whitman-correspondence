            <p class="tei_p">I believe it is JWWs intention to write to JA Symonds next week
                &amp; to send him copies of HLT's &amp; Warry's letters so as to put him <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">au courant</span> with the latest first hand news concerning
                you</p>
            <p class="tei_p">S.K's article is extremely interesting &amp; valuable from the side light it throws
                upon your character and personality.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In this week's <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Literary World</span> there is a long notice of an
                Italian book on Holland &amp; as I thought the extracts given might interest you I
                send you the paper in which you will also see that a new poem by Tennyson is announced</p>

                believe.</p>              
            <p class="tei_p">I much regret to hear that your health continues so unsatisfactory &amp; I fear that
                this long continued spell of illness may tell even upon <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> mastery &amp; indomitable spirit. Of my sympathy you are already
                assured &amp; what can I say but renew the expression of my personal affection &amp;
                reverence for you &amp; send you a "heart full of good wishes" &amp; hopes for the
                dawning of brighter days for you. May God grant that it may be so is my heart felt
                prayer. But as you say—"it will be all right either way."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have had remarkably fine weather here lately—frosty nights &amp; foggy
                mornings followed by days of brilliant sunshine—&amp; today I read of a
                butterfly having been seen—a harbinger of the coming spring.</p>
