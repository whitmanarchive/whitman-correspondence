                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    critic, had lauded Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Broadway Annual</span> in
                    1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
                    to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
                    See Harold Blodgett, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman in England</span> (1934),

                    (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
                    attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip

                    Whitman entitled "The American Socrates," in which he describes Whitman as "the
                    wisest and noblest, the most truly great, of all modern literary men" (345).
                    Buchanan goes on to write, "We have a beautiful singer in Tennyson, and some day
                    it will be among Tennyson's highest honours that he was once named kindly and
                    appreciatively by Whitman" (346). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3080">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3080 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3080"><span>John Hay (1838–1905) was
