                &amp; glad to hear from you indeed—I suppose by this time you have rec'd the letter 
                I sent yesterday 27th<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I sent you the Galaxy, but I see by your letter 
                that George had already bought one. I have seen the piece in Thursday's Times<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—John Swinton sent me one—so you can enclose it to Jeff—I have just received 
                a letter from England, enclosing other notices, &amp;c.—Mr. Conway is very friendly—but my friend Col. Hinton,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> (in his letter some weeks ago in the Rochester Express,) 
                has given him, Conway, some pretty sharp cuts about his ridiculous anecdotes of me 
                &amp; you too<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—Still Conway seems to mean all the good he can. But such descriptions 
                of me as, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">he was never known to smile or laugh</span>," is altogether too jolly—dont you think so?

            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, I will again write a few lines—I have been out most 
                all the afternoon—went up first to the Impeachment trial, &amp; heard Mr. Evarts<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> 
                speak a while, &amp; then left, for it seemed too pleasant outdoors to stay in there—I took a long walk, &amp; ride in the cars away out in the suburbs, 
                &amp; so back to dinner, &amp; now this evening another walk—&amp; have fetched in 
                here at the office, to sit awhile, read the paper &amp;c.—I received to-day 
                another letter from old Mr. Alcott<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—I sent him the Galaxy with "Personalism"—&amp; he compliments me highly, &amp; speaks of Mr. Emerson too &amp; his friendliness to me—We have had a warm but very pleasant day—I am feeling very well—I only hope, dear mother, you are feeling well &amp; in good spirits.

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, your letter of Wednesday, 29th, came this forenoon—it was too bad 
                you didn't get mine Tuesday, as I put it in the P. O. myself Monday—So you are not going to move at present—I too remain in the same place, 
                but have been going to move all winter &amp; the spring too—I have been in the office 
                all day to-day—all the rest of the clerks wanted to go up to the 
                Impeachment trial, but I didn't care to go.

            <p class="tei_p">I have received another paper from England to-day, with a tremendous big favorable notice 
                of my book, between three &amp; four columns, one of the friendliest notices yet written.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>

                but I guess I shall spend my half-holiday mostly in jaunting around in the open air. 
                Every thing begins to look like summer here—the trees are all green—we are having it pretty warm to-day, but a little hazy—it is now 12 o'clock—the noon-bell has just rung, &amp; I am off for the rest of the day—Take good care of yourself, dear mother—</p></div>
            
            <div class=""><p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday afternoon</span>—Mother, you see I am determined to make you out a letter—I have been sitting here in the office all alone, fixing up my new piece<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> 
                for the Galaxy—for I have still another piece, besides those that have already appeared—Two have appeared, &amp; now this is the third one, addressed to the literary classes—I want the Galaxy folks to print it in the July number, but they havn't sent me word yet 
                whether they will or no. It is a pleasant day—we have had quite a rain storm 
                yesterday afternoon &amp; last night—I am going out at 6 o'clock to 
                O'Connors to tea—Mother, I hope you are having a pleasant Sunday.

            <p class="tei_p">Well, I had a quiet, agreeable sort of Sunday—wrote &amp; read most of the forenoon, 
                &amp; rambled out in the afternoon—&amp; went up to O'Connor's in the evening—he had two or three others there, visitors—O'Connors &amp; Burroughs's are very hospitable to me, 
                the same as they always have been—they are almost the only places I go—I send you a couple of papers same mail with this—I am going to send the MS

                    "Monadnock" reported under "Affairs in England": "Of course you know that
                    English and French critics admit but one American Poet. Bryant, Longfellow and
                    the rest are only second and third rate English poets—the one American
                    poet is Walt Whitman." The journalist quoted generously from the review of
                    William Michael Rossetti's edition in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leader</span> by
                    Edmund Yates (for Yates, see Walt Whitman's <a href="loc.01578">May 7,
                        1873</a> letter). In a dispatch "From Great Britain" in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> on May 9, 1868, G. W. Smalley commented hostilely
                    on the favorable review of Walt Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span>,
                    and concluded: "Mr. Carlyle likens [Walt Whitman] to a buffalo, useful in
                    fertilizing the soil, but mistaken in supposing that his contributions of that
                    sort are matters which the world desires to contemplate closely." On May 20,
                    1868, O'Connor wrote to Rossetti to inquire about the authenticity of Carlyle's
                    remarks; see William Michael Rossetti, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span>
                    (New York: Charles Scribners Sons, 1903), 355–356. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00159_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00159_n3"><span>Richard J. Hinton
                    (1830–1901) was born in London and came to the U.S. in 1851. He trained as
                    a printer, and, like James Redpath (with whom Walt Whitman corresponded on <a href="loc.00778">August 6, 1863</a>), went to Kansas and joined John
                    Brown. In fact, but for an accident he would have been with Brown at Harper's
                    Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was hanged. With Redpath, Hinton was the author
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hand-book to Kansas Territory and the Rocky Mountains' Gold
                        Region</span> (1859). Later he wrote <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rebel Invasion of
                        Missouri and Kansas</span> (1865) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Brown and His
                        Men</span> (1894). Apparently Hinton had suggested that Thayer and Eldridge
                    print <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New
                        Voice</span>, 16 (4 February 1899), 2. Hinton served in the Union Army from
                    1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a hospital, a scene which
                    he described in the Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span> on August 26,
                    1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many newspapers. He defended O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span> in the Milwaukee <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel</span> on February 9, 1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening Express</span> on March 7, 1868, was a lengthy account
                    of Walt Whitman's "Fame and Fortunes in England and America," with quotations
                    from O'Connor and Burroughs. Obviously pleased, Walt Whitman sent it to friends,
                    including Rossetti, who acknowledged it on <a href="loc.01879">April 12,
                        1868</a>. See Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.76.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> (1906–1996), 2:396;

                    Evarts Attorney General later in the year; Whitman reported the news in his <a href="upa.00281">July 17, 1868</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
