    <div class="editorial_notes"><hr/><p><em>Correspondent:</em><br/><span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n6173 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n6173"><span>John Newton Johnson was a
                    self-styled philosopher from rural Alabama whom Whitman described as "a good
                    affectionate fellow, a sort of uncut gem." There are about thirty letters from
                    Johnson in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection, but unfortunately there are no
                    replies extant, although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately
                    fifteen years. When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01838">September 13, 1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," a former Rebel
                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
                    war he had been "a youthful 'patriarch.'" He informed Whitman that during the
                    past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and, after a
                    momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hung for
                        swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of Whitman's verse, and "I assure
                    you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting that the $3 book was worth
                    $50 if it could not be replaced. (Now Laugh)." He offered either to sell
                    Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all profits or to lend him money. In the
                    letter he enclosed a gold dollar: "So much grand poetry nearly kills me with the
                    pain of delight." Characteristically, he concluded his letter with an unexpected
                    question: "Walt! Are you Orthodox or Universalist? I am Materialist of late." On
                        <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>, after describing
                    Guntersville, Ala., he commented: "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes
                    with the usual <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lack</span> of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">flowers</span> or
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fruit</span>." His amusingly detailed description of his
                    face on <a href="loc.02386">November 7, 1875</a>, Whitman marked in red
                    crayon. Thus Johnson became a self-designated philosophical jester to amuse
                    Whitman. See also Charles N. Elliot, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman as Man, Poet
