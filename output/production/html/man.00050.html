                        with Trübner &amp; Co. were handled through Josiah Child. See the
                        letter from Whitman to Child of <a href="loc.01264">August 9,
                        1878</a>. On <a href="loc.05319">May 31, 1877</a>, Trübner sent
                        Whitman $7.57 in payment for copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic
                            Vistas</span>, and noted that 61 copies of that work were still on hand
                        (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On November 8 Whitman recorded that
                        Trübner owed him $70 for ten sets and "also something due me for
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dem: Vistas</span>." On December 6 he received
                        $47.55 from Trübner in payment for six sets and for fifteen (twelve
                        according to the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of <a href="upa.00194">December 12, 1878</a>) copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span>; the balance due was $28 for four sets and
                        $17.02 for forty-six copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic
                        Vistas</span>.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Whitman received a payment from Trübner through Josiah Child on June 9,
                        1879, and an order for books. See the letter from Whitman to Child of <a href="med.00634">June 9, 1879</a>. Probably the payment amounted to
                        $24.50, since in making a tally of the books in Trübner's
                        possession as of June 27, he noted thirty-seven volumes (including
                        thirty-six sent on June 25 or 27) and forty-six copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span>. On March 4, 1880, he received in payment
                        $37.22; on July 22, 1880, $80.50, at which time he sent thirty-four
                        volumes; on March 4, 1881, $105.37, at which time he sent an additional
                        twenty volumes; and on December 8, 1881, he received $80.50. At that
                        time the balance due was $14.43 for thirty-nine copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span>. At a later date Whitman added to
                        this entry, "all paid in full" (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
