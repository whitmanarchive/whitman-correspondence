                    <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>, enclosing Logan Smith's,
                    came to hand last evening—as I was about to answer it today 
                    comes along the Complete L. of G.
                    and letter of 6<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> announcing it! Thanks, dear Walt, many thanks
                    for the good book with its good inscription and
                    thanks equally for the good letter accompanying it. The finished
                    book at last! After nearly 40 yrs building and polishing! Well it is worth it,
                    it has (that same book) a wonderful future before it.
                    What scholars will ponder it in the ages to come! What
                    commentators darken it!
                    What annotations load it with heavy &amp; weary notes! but also
                    what thousands and thousands of young men and young women and
                    middleaged men &amp; women will rejoice in it and
                    find their lives deepened &amp; widened by it! Yes &amp;
                    many will be driven to madness by its enticements
                    to unfathomable deeps of thought &amp; feeling. When
                    it becomes known
                    for long &amp; long it will be THE BOOK—all others will stand
                    on a lower plane.
                    I am satisfied that I know something of it and of you—that is greatness 
                    enough for me—yes and greatness enough to carry my name down thro' 
                    all the ages</p>
