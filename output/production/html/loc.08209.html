                    came to hand last evening—as I was about to answer it today

                    for the good book with its good inscription and
                    thanks equally for the good letter accompanying it. The finished
                    book at last! After nearly 40 yrs building and polishing! Well it is worth it,
                    it has (that same book) a wonderful future before it.
                    What scholars will ponder it in the ages to come! What
                    commentators darken it!
                    What annotations load it with heavy &amp; weary notes! but also
                    what thousands and thousands of young men and young women and
                    middleaged men &amp; women will rejoice in it and
                    find their lives deepened &amp; widened by it! Yes &amp;
                    many will be driven to madness by its enticements
                    to unfathomable deeps of thought &amp; feeling. When
                    it becomes known
                    for long &amp; long it will be THE BOOK—all others will stand
                    on a lower plane.
                    I am satisfied that I know something of it and of you—that is greatness 
                    enough for me—yes and greatness enough to carry my name down thro' 
                    all the ages</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
                    Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
                    brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.

                    copy of the final <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> before his death, and
                    he also wanted to be able to present copies to his friends. A version of the
                    1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, often referred to as the
                    "deathbed edition," was bound in December of 1891 so that Whitman could give the
                    volume to friends at Christmas. The following year, the 1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Phildelphia publisher
                    David McKay. This volume reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex consisted of a long prefatory essay
                    entitled "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" and sixty-five poems; while the
                    second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection of thirty-one short poems taken
                    from the gathering of prose and poetry published under that title by McKay in
                    1891. For more information on this volume of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>, see
