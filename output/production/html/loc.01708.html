        <span class="tei_salute">My dear Ramsdell,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Perhaps it may hardly be necessary, but I feel to write you a line of caution about the
        Tennyson letter. I rely on your promise not to publish the
        letter, nor any thing equivalent to it. The fact of it, with Tennyson's complimentary
        message &amp; invitation, I have no objection to your printing &amp;, after what I have
        said, leave it to you to carry all that out. You might do well to put in about my intended
          appearance before the American Institute, at its 40th opening,
        Sept. 7th in New York, and that the curiosity of both my friends &amp; foes is extremely
        piqued, &amp;c &amp;c.—what the poem will be—how delivered—&amp;c
        &amp;c—</p>
