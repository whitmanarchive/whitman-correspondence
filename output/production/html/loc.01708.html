      <p class="tei_p">Perhaps it may hardly be necessary, but I feel to write you a line of caution about the
        Tennyson letter.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> I rely on your promise not to publish the
        letter, nor any thing equivalent to it. The fact of it, with Tennyson's complimentary
        message &amp; invitation, I have no objection to your printing &amp;, after what I have
        said, leave it to you to carry all that out. You might do well to put in about my intended
          appearance<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> before the American Institute, at its 40th opening,
        Sept. 7th in New York, and that the curiosity of both my friends &amp; foes is extremely
        piqued, &amp;c &amp;c.—what the poem will be—how delivered—&amp;c

                    (1839–1887) was a clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E.
                    Huntington Library, San Marino, California), Whitman called him "chief clerk." Ramsdell was the
                    Washington correspondent for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> and the
                    Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span>. On <a href="loc.01829">May 8,
                        1867</a>, Ramsdell reported the high praise that George Townsend, the
                    journalist (1841–1914), accorded to Whitman—"a stupendous
                    genius," "the song of a God." On <a href="loc.01830">July 17, 1867</a>, he
                    asked Whitman to do whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho,
                    against whom charges had been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward
                    Dexter Holbrook (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory.
                    Actually, on July 12, 1867, Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a
                    "Report on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Charges</span> submitted by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. E. D. Holbrook</span>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">against</span>
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. Milton Kelly</span>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
                    Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
                    in Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
                    Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but inscribed by Whitman, dated July 20,
                    1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
                    ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
                    presented." On <a href="loc.01832">July 22, 1867</a>, Ramsdell apologized
                    for his "aggressiveness." Judge Kelly wrote to Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867
                    (National Archives), and again on <a href="yal.00125">August 9, 1867</a>.
                    On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow
                    (1832–1896), Secretary of the Treasury, that Whitman "be appointed to a
                    position in the Treasury Department" (National Archives &amp; Records Administration, Washington, D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r0494">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01708_n1 note" id="loc.01708_n1"><span>The reference is to Tennyson's <a href="med.00410">July 12, 1871</a> letter to Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01708_n2 note" id="loc.01708_n2"><span>Walt Whitman read "After All, Not to
