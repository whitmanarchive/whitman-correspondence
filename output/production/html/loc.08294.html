			    you as some of us are! I have spent this whole day in the house—there was nothing especial to do 
			    outside so I worked at the lecture which I have to give in Montreal (to the students there) abt. 1 Oct. 
			    I have got the lecture now pretty well under way—I saw Mrs Costelloe day 
                before yesterday for a few minutes on the street—I was going to call on her and met her—the 
                same day I saw Mr Costelloe for an hour on meter business. I am to see him and some 
                other parties tomorrow about the meter. I hope to see Mr &amp; Mrs Smith 
                in the course of a week or two and to call on Tennyson from there. I am to go to 
                Mrs Costelloes to dinner tomorrow evening and expect to meet with Alys there. 
                I saw a letter from Mr Smith to a friend the other day in which he spoke quite warmly of you so I guess if 
                he does not write it is only from want of time—or
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00396.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jm.00396.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00396.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
			    perhaps his sight is too bad to write much. Any way I will let you know all about it later. I am enjoying my 
			    visit here and am feeling first class—but I shall not be glad to get back to America &amp; Canada 
			    again when the time comes. I would rather be closer to you and other dear friends. Best love to you dear Walt from your friend</p>
