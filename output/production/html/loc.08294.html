			    you as some of us are! I have spent this whole day in the house—there was nothing especial to do

                before yesterday for a few minutes on the street—I was going to call on her and met her—the

                other parties tomorrow about the meter. I hope to see Mr<a href="#n4979" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4979">7</a> &amp; Mrs Smith<a href="#n6170" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6170">8</a>

                I saw a letter from Mr Smith to a friend the other day in which he spoke quite warmly of you so I guess if

			    perhaps his sight is too bad to write much. Any way I will let you know all about it later. I am enjoying my

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
