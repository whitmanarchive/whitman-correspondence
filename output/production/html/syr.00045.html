            <p class="tei_p">The two post cards (re Mrs Costelloe and O'C.) are this moment to hand. We absolutely must not look for any
                but the worst kind of news from poor O'C. the only consolation in the case is that
                /he/ does not suffer, at least not much. Some day (quite likely soon) he will have a
                series of fits that will end his life. It is bad, infernally bad, but we must stand
                    it. [â€”] I am not well pleased that Mrs. C.has another <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">girl</span>, I hoped she would
                have a boy this time. Mrs &amp; Mr Smith
                will be disappointed. C. himself is I suppose too busy to think much about these
                little matters. Nothing new here, weather colder but still bright and pleasant. I am
                still hard at it trying to get things straightened out</p>
