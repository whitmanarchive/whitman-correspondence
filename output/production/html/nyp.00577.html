            <p class="tei_p">Here is for your edition, a special concluding note to "Specimen Days"—a short
                Preface for it I have already sent you—also I suppose you have rec'd the
                parcel of pictures I sent you—Nothing very new with me—I have been
                lately ab't the same as usual, but am quite unwell to-day—I shall send an
                additional paper or so to eke out the "Democratic Vistas" volume—I told you in
                the former note that I gave you power to decide in such exigencies as always occur
                in book publishing, &amp; I confirm it—</p>
