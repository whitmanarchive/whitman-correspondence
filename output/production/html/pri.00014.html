                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    Whitman's anonymous reply to the article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Springfield Republican</span> of January 18, which attacked the "loose talk" of Joaquin
                    Miller and others that Whitman was "a neglected martyr," and averred that
                    Whitman was "not yet in want, though three years of illness and enforced
                    idleness have used up his savings." In the West Jersey <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span>, Whitman protested his neglect by American readers, publishers,
                    and poets. He had recently printed, he declared, a two-volume edition of his
                    complete writings "'to keep the wolf from the door' in old age." See Clifton

                    the last two sentences of the first paragraph of this letter. According to
                    Rossetti's letter on <a href="loc.01886">February 28, 1876</a>, the editor

                    described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    "Author's Edition," with most copies personally signed by the poet. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> was published as a companion volume to the
