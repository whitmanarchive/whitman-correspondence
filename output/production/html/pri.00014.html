            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I send you the enclosed piece (printed in a paper here, with my consent,)—quite 
                willing you should have it put, if convenient, in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Academy</span>,
                or any other literary gazette, your way, if thought proper. My theory is that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the plain truth</span>
                of the situation here is best stated. It is even worse <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">than</span> described in the article.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">With me, things are going on as for a year or two past—am no worse—work a little—still remain 
                in Camden. I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter—have seen of late 
                months Joaquin Miller, M. D. Conway, 
                Lord Houghton, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">&amp;c</span> I have 
                lately heard from, but not seen, Marvin, my Boston friend. John Burroughs 
                was here with me last week. He is well. I have about got ready my two Volumes—"Leaves
                of Grass" remains about the same, (a few new bits)

                 "Two Rivulets," the other Vol. has some new stuff—will write further to you soon anent of the books.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">Was interested &amp; pleased with your letter about the dinner—sent it to Marvin to read. 
                I have seen Peter Bayne's piece—have also seen the friendly &amp; glowing article of Arthur 
                Clive in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Gentleman's Magazine</span>. Who is A. C.?—When 
                you write tell me something about him.</p>
