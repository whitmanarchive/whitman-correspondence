            <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter,
                &amp; was glad to hear from 
                you—I am still in a pretty bad way—I am writing this 
                over at the office, at my desk, but 
                feel to-day more like laying down than sitting up—I do not walk any better, &amp; my head 
                has frequent distress—Still, for all that I slowly gain strength—very slowly—&amp; 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">shall yet get well</span> as ever—Every thing goes on about the same, in the 
                sphere of my affairs, &amp;c. as when I last saw you—Mother is at 
                Camden—mopes &amp; worries a good deal about me—I don't feel like leaving here, for visiting 
                or any purpose, until I get so I can move about—The

                doctor is applying electricity, every other day—I have had it now five or six times—I anticipate 
                benefit in a while, but it makes no perceptible difference yet—How and where is 
                'Sula?—I 
                wish I was where I could come in &amp; see her &amp; you often—(those nice breakfasts were bright 
                spots, &amp; I shall not forget them)—if I could just get 'round and sit an hour or so for a change, 
                &amp; chat with 'Sula and you, two or three times a week, I believe it would do me good—but I must 
                take it out in imagination—for it is impossible in reality—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I got a long letter from Dowden—he mentions you—As I sit I 
                look over from my office window on the President's grounds—the grass is green enough—they have 
                already been over it once with the cutter, &amp; Saturday there were men out there in their shirt-sleeves 
                raking it up—I have a big bunch of lilacs in a pitcher in my room—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Washington looks about the same—rather cool &amp; cloudy to-day—but pleasant weather 
                may-be by the time you receive this—best love to you &amp; 'Sula</p>
