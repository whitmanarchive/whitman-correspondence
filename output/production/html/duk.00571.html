                    Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on
                    active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle
                    of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                    Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and
                    began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and later a
                    mason named French. George eventually took up a position as inspector of pipes
                    in Brooklyn and Camden.

                        1863</a> letter to Louisa, one on October 14 and a "short note" that he

                    two weeks to get a letter from home." Louisa also paraphrased George's surmise
                    toward the end of his October 16 letter that the geographical separation of the
                    Fifty-first Regiment, New York Volunteers, in Camp Nelson, Kentucky, had

                    (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
                    for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
                    December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
                    Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
                    some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
                    Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
                    (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22, 1870</a> letter to Walt).
