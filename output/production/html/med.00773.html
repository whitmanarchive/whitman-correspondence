            <p class="tei_p">My reading for the last two or three days (limited) of the articles in Century about <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kearsarge</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Alabama</span>, which I have just finished. They form by far the best contribution I know to the literature of the Secession era, and are full of realism and thrill. The pictures are masterly. I only wish we could have accounts of all the swell episodes of the war in the same way, or approximately to it. I want personally to thank you all, writers and picture-makers.</p>

                    (1844–1909). Whitman had met Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H.
                    Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1955], 482), and considered Gilder one of the
                    "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art delirium" (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
