            <p class="tei_p">My reading for the last two or three days (limited) of the articles in Century about <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kearsarge</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Alabama</span>, which I have just finished. They form by far the best contribution I know to the literature of the Secession era, and are full of realism and thrill. The pictures are masterly. I only wish we could have accounts of all the swell episodes of the war in the same way, or approximately to it. I want personally to thank you all, writers and picture-makers.</p>
