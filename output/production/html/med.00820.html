                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir.</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Presumptuous as it may be, I cannot refrain from sending these few lines to you from
                the old country to thank you for the new life your poems have given to me. Since
                reading them—and I have read them again and again—especially the Leaves
                of Grass, I have felt conscious of a new vista opening before me. I am only
                twenty-three—yet I feel as if the past few years (breaking away gradually, as
                I have been, from surroundings orthodox and conventional) were long eras of
                indifference and lethargy. How delightful to feel that there are such great
                possibilities in life! All my sceptical rejection of creeds and dogmas is giving
                place to a sense of the eternal fitness of things. In my blind unreasoning egotism I
                mistook the shadow for the substance, and thought that "religion" was what is
                preached from the orthodox pulpit and practiced in the city. And then I came upon
                two lines of your Leaves of Grass:</p>

            <span class="tei_lg">
                <span class="tei_l"> "I swear the earth shall surely be complete to</span>
                <span class="tei_l"> him or her who shall be complete!</span>
                <span class="tei_l"> I swear the earth remains jagged and broken only</span>
                <span class="tei_l"> to him or her who remains broken and jagged!"</span>
                <span class="tei_l"/>
            </span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish I could explain to you in what way they touched as with a magnet some latent
                chord. And yet I feel there is no need to explain anything. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">You
                will understand</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have already reached across the water and clasped your hand. I have found something
                deeper and more precious to me than your printed words. I am looking forward
                hopefully and joyfully to a future which shall not be lacking in strength.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Forgive my illogical desultory manner of writing. I think you will understand all I
                would convey. The little picture of your home life in Specimen Days has so much
                interested me. Now I feel as if I knew you in the flesh as well as in the spirit.
                Accept the grateful thanks of yours faithfully.</p>
