                No clergiman this morning so I read the service and a sermon (One of Chas. Kingleys) myself. Since then
               have been writing official letters. It is now afternoon—perfect weather—cool, bright, white
               fleecy clouds on every hand, a gentle breeze stirring—flowers, trees, grass all in fine order after
               the good rain a few days ago. Your post card of 21<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> came to hand
                yesterday—no sign yet of D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Johnston, singular how he could have disappeared
                so completely. Willy Gurd is at the asylum today—he lives in the city (London) now—works
               every day in the meter shop. He has a man working with him, they are getting ready to produce meters,
               expect to be actually manufacturing (turning out meters) in another week or two.

                At the asylum all is very quiet, Mr &amp; Mrs Ingram will have given you a good idea how peaceably and quietly
               life goes on with us. I am satisfied, have really all I want except only I should like to see you oftener and have
               more time to give to the good cause—but perhaps (as far as this last is concerned) the little I do now is as much
               as I could do under any circumstances. I got the other day from England a little book by Havelock Ellis called
                "The Criminal"[.] I am greatly interested in it. We are all well—Little Pardee
               is taking private lessons (at the house) in Greek, Latin and French [/] we think after it is over he will be quiet
               strong and may go to school or college as well as any boy—he is in fact <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">quite well</span>
               now, the only thing being to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">keep him so</span>
