                No clergiman this morning so I read the service and a sermon (One of Chas. Kingleys<a href="#n0137" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0137">1</a>) myself. Since then
               have been writing official letters. It is now afternoon—perfect weather—cool, bright, white
               fleecy clouds on every hand, a gentle breeze stirring—flowers, trees, grass all in fine order after
               the good rain a few days ago. Your post card of 21<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span><a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> came to hand

               every day in the meter shop. He has a man working with him, they are getting ready to produce meters,
               expect to be actually manufacturing (turning out meters) in another week or two.

               more time to give to the good cause—but perhaps (as far as this last is concerned) the little I do now is as much
               as I could do under any circumstances. I got the other day from England a little book by Havelock Ellis<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a> called

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and

                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
