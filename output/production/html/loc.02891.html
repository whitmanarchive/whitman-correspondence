                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their

                    (Herbert, Beatrice, and Grace) from England to Philadelphia. The family lived in
                    Philadelphia from 1876 to 1878; Whitman visited their home almost daily and even
                    had his own room. From April 1878, to 1879, the Gilchrists lived in Concord,
                    Boston, and New York, before returning to England. Anne's son Herbert
                    (1857–1914) remained in America and lived in Philadelphia, maintaining a
                    close relationship with Whitman; after Whitman's death in 1892, he returned to
