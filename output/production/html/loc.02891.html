            <p class="tei_p">Just a line of birthday greeting, my dearest Friend. May it find you enjoying the beautiful spring-time &amp; the 
                grand sights of people &amp; products &amp; the music at Philadelphia notwithstanding drawbacks (but lessening drawbacks 
                I earnestly hope) of health, lameness. Rejoiced, too, perhaps with the sight of many dear old friends whom

                occasion has brought to your city. May all that will do you good come my dearest Friend–and not least the 
                sense of relief &amp; joy in having fulfilled the great task, in the teeth of such difficulties, re-launched 
                safely, more fully, richly equipt the ship to sail down the great ocean of Time, bearing precious precious

                ought to secure one's cabin a couple of months or so beforehand. But if there be indeed an increasing hope of 
                your coming here in the course of the summer or if you think it would be best for us to go to New York

                very desirable to come this year &amp; for others to wait till next. With Bee for instance we are 
                both losing time &amp; wasting money by going over another winter here when there is no complete &amp; satisfactory medical 
                course to be had. Then as regards dear Per he writes me word that though he is doing fairly well
