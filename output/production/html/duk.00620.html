                    1, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 28, 1873, but February
                    28 did not fall on Saturday, the day in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, in the
                    year 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter March 1, 1873 (Walt Whitman,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University
                    Press, 1961–77], 2:370), and Miller's date, which did fall on Saturday, is
                    correct. Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's death on February 19 was very recent
                    at the time of this letter, and three letters that Louisa had received date this
                    letter to Saturday, March 1. February 22 can be eliminated as a possibility
                    because Louisa had received a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and
                    Jeff described his February 24, 1873 letter to his mother as the first he had
                    written since Mattie's death (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
                        Whitman</span>, [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 158). Louisa
                    described Jeff's letter as a "long one" with "the particulars of matties death,"
                    and that description is consistent with Jeff's February 24, 1873 letter.
                    Louisa's letter also acknowledges Walt's payment for Edward Whitman's board, the
                    $20 that he promised to send within two or three days of his <a href="nyp.00312">February 26, 1873</a> letter. Finally, Louisa
                    paraphrases two lines from granddaughter Manahatta Whitman's <a href="loc.00634">February 23, 1873</a> letter (Feinberg Collection,
                    Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"

                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. Walt had promised to send $20 for Edward's board a
                    few days earlier (see his <a href="nyp.00312">February 26, 1873</a> letter

                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
                    ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
                    daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
                    to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
                    see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha

                    cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying bronchial
                    symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the

                        planned to take her out. He placed her in a buggy: she collapsed and died
                        later that evening (see Jeff's February 24, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor

                    <p class="tei_p">Jeff Whitman was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman,
                        Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he worked as a
                        surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working for the
                        Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil War.
                        In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                        nationally recognized name in civil engineering. He married wife Martha
                        Mitchell (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," in 1859, and Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman had shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for
                        St. Louis. Mattie and her two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa, joined
                        Jeff in St. Louis in early 1868.
