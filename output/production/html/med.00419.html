                    <p class="tei_p">This appears to be a note written while Whitman was still in Washington;
                        therefore, the year 1873 seems plausible, since before his illness Whitman
                        would have gone for the books himself.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
