                <span class="tei_salute">My Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your card to hand last night, with its sad account of dear Mrs.
                Stafford's health;<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> but what the doctor says is cheering.
                I wonder, though, what the doctor would call good weather—mild spring, I
                suppose.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Very glad, my dear old Walt, to see your strong familiar handwriting again; it does
                one good, it's so individual that it is next to seeing you. Right glad to hear of
                your good health—had an idea that you were not so well again this winter. John
                Burroughs<a href="#n0129" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0129">2</a> was very violent against my intaglio;<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> on the
                other hand, Alma Tadema<a href="#n3083" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3083">4</a>—our great painter
                here—liked it very much. I take violent criticism pretty philosophically, now
                that I see how unreliable it nearly always is. John Burroughs has got a fixed idea
                about your personality, and that is that the top of your head is a foot high and any
                portrait that doesn't develop the "dome" is no portrait.—Curious what eyes a
                man may have for everything except a picture. I finished lately a life-size portrait
                of James Simmons, J.P.,<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">5</a> a hunting (fox) squire of the old school—such a fine
                old fellow. My portrait represents him standing firmly, in a scarlet hunting-coat
                well stained with many a wet chase, his great whip tucked under his arm whilst
                buttoning on his left glove, white buckskin trousers in shade relieving the scarlet
                coat, black velvet hunting cap, dark rich blue background to qualify and cool the
                scarlet. I wish you could see it. Then I have painted a subject "The Good Gray
                Poet's Gift." I have long meant to build up something of you from my studies, adding
                colour. You play a prominent part in this picture—seated at table bending
                over a nosegay of flowers, poetizing, before presenting them to mother.<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">6</a> I am
                standing up bending over the tea-pot, with the kettle, filling it up; opposite you
                sits Giddy;<a href="#n0261" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0261">7</a> out of the window a pretty view of Cannon place,
                Hampstead. Mater thinks it a pretty picture and a good likeness of you, just as you
                used to sit at tea with us at 1729 N. 22nd St. Now I am going out for a stroll on
                Hampstead Heath. Have just come in from a long ramble over the Heaths—a lovely
                soft spring day, innumerable birds in full song. I think J. B. is right when he says
                that your birds are more plaintive than ours—it's nature's way of
                compensating us for a loss of sunshine: what would England be without the merry
                lark, the very embodiment of cheeriness. Are not the Carlyle<a href="#n0139" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0139">8</a>
                &amp; Emerson<a href="#n1044" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1044">9</a> letters interesting? It seems to me to be one of
                the most beautiful and pathetic things in literature, C's fondness for E. But all
                Englishmen, I must tell you, are not grumblers like Carlyle; he stands quite alone
                in that quality—look at Darwin!<a href="#n3075" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3075">10</a></p>

Stafford was the
                    mother of Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while
                    working at the printing office of the Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New
                    Republic</span>. Whitman regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near

                    the late 1870s, Mrs. Stafford had been frequently ill. In Whitman's letter to
                    Herbert Gilchrist from <a href="upa.00076">April 15, 1883</a>, the poet
                    mentions a "severe fit of illness" of Harry's mother lasting "three

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    the couple divorced twelve years later. Before her marriage to Frend, Grace
                    became involved with playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950); an 1888
                    letter from Shaw to Grace's brother Herbert Gilchrist suggests that the
