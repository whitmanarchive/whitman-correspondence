                    private in Company I of the 120th New York Infantry, was wounded at the Battle
                    of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. Whitman noted that Vandemark was placed in
                    "bed 39-Ward B" at Armory Square Hospital, and Whitman may have written a letter
                    to Vandemark's sister Sarah in Accord, New York (Edward F. Grier, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span>, [New York:

                    and was briefly transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps during the summer of
                    1864 before returning to his regiment. He was killed on a skirmish line during
                    the charge on Fort Davis at Petersburg, Virginia, on September 28, 1864. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_tex.00129_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="tex.00129_n2"><span>Felter Kelder, a private in
