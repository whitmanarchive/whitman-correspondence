         <p class="tei_p">Sir: whether it agrees with your own opinion or not I hope you will open your columns to this communication of mine, seeking to stir up the government to a general exchange of prisoners.<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> I hope also you may feel to say a word about it editorially—if you could call attention to it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I have sent similar communications this afternoon to one or two other papers, I would particularly solicit that you find room for it in tomorrow's issue.
