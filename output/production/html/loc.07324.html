            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> enclosing Mrs Costelloe's to hand this afternoon—both letters entirely
                welcome. I am exceedingly sorry for Mrs Costelloe but the fact is the life she went
                in for (an attempt to carry all London on her back) was simply suicidal. Should she
                fully recover from this breakdown (as I trust and think she will) she will no doubt
                be wiser and do better in future. Have just been up at the patient's dance for half
                an hour—some 400 people in the hall having quite a time—we have a new
                hall this year nearly twice as big as the old one and only up one stair which is
                quite an improvement on<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00660.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00660.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00660.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            the old hall (where you were at chapel once) up three flights. Letter from Willy
                Gurd today—nothing in it—does not say a word as
                to when he will be through and return here. But I guess it is all right and that he
                will be here soon. Yes, I fear you are dull enough mais, courage mon Ami! Never say
                die! When the meter turns into money (which may be sooner than we think) I am going
                to see if I can't do something to cheer you up a little—in the meantime it is
                grand to see you keep up as well as you do—and actually gaining if any thing
                as the months pass—we might have some good quiet times together yet if the 
                Lord pleases—and if not? well, we will say "all right any how"</p>
