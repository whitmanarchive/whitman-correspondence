            <p class="tei_p">Yours came this morning, &amp; I am satisfied &amp; agreeable—Edward
                Wilkins (tell me more ab't him—is he a
                Canadian?) should understand that it is not a soft or profitable job, &amp; some
                features not very nice either—I have tho't of
                dispensing any caretaker, but I believe I get no nearer to even the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">middling-get-along-condition-of-myself</span> before this
                spell—with a sort of prospect (if I live at all) of getting in a more immobile
                situation than ever—(am indeed in a pretty bad way now)—But you &amp;
                Horace manage it, &amp; I shall be docile—If E W is indeed the proper one
                &amp; willing I shall be glad enough to have him—</p>  

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd a nice letter f'm E C Stedman (44 East 26th St
                New York) this mn'g—He likes Nov. B." and has considerable to say of my
                "fame"—(I am not sure but we are to put E C S on our <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">list of
                    real permanent friends &amp; understanders</span>)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you have got (or will soon get) the Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> short notice of Nov: B—I
                rec'd a note from Hamlin Garland, Jamaica Plain, Mass.
                asking me to send Nov. B. to W D Howells, wh' I did.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting in my big chair by the oak wood fire as I write—it is a darkish,
                damp, heavy-air'd day &amp; I am not feeling my easiest—Mr Ingram has just
                been in &amp; bo't a copy of Nov: B. for a Quakeress friend, &amp; got some loose
                reading matter for a prisoner in jail I send to sometimes—my head is weighty &amp; sore to-day—</p> 

            <p class="tei_p">Dave McKay is behaving very well—he takes the whole ed'n,
                &amp; pays me $313.50 on Jan 10 '89—&amp; pays the binder—I retain 100
                (printed 1100)—Did I tell you I rec'd a strong
                affectionate literary &amp; personal letter from Kennedy—I repeat that last photo of you in hat &amp;c. is one of the very best
                could be made—there is nothing better made here or in N Y—</p>
