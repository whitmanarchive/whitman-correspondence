            <p class="tei_p">I have returned the two pamphlets—which I suppose you have rec'd. In a letter in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> of
                to-day I have printed (as I some time since notified you) what you said—(well said)—about actors—I remain here till
                latter part of next week—then to Camden, New Jersey, which is my permanent p o
                address—Shall count on getting the extracts from your Journal about Mr
                Lincon's murder &amp; funeral soon as you can conveniently send
                    them.</p>
