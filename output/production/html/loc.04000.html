                be with you this Thanksgiving<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—but I will come one
                of these times—Since I have got into this shanty, although I go out every day,
                I don't go any distance—havn't been away this past summer, only one short trip
                to Cape May<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—My lameness increases on me—it
                probably won't be long before I shall be unable to get around at all——General
                health otherwise about the same as usual—Eva, my dear friend it would be a
                true comfort for me if it was so I could come in every few days, and you and Harry

                the last fifteen months—Harry your Mother call'd here last Monday, but I was
                not in, was over to Germantown—I was sorry to be away—I am writing this
                up in my room—am alone most of the time—write a little most every
                day—sell a piece once in a while—Maintain good spirits and a first-rate

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
