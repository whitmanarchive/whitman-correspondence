            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very notable or different. Your letters rec'd &amp; welcomed—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span> also—hearty thanks for y'r services &amp;
                promptness in conveying the books—yes I will leave you to pay express
                tax—but I had meant to refund—I have rec'd from every one letters of
                acknowledgm't &amp;c. (Mrs: Fairchild's to you is here
                enclosed return'd)—Baxter's splended notice &amp;
                setting-forth of the book, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> of last Thursday, is
                rec'd, &amp; seems to me the most complete &amp; most friendly &amp; penetrating
                (from the point of view of an absorber, believer &amp; democrat) I have ever
                had—Dr Bucke will have a good time over it—I hear
                from B often—he is well, busied with his large family, with the Asylum, &amp;
                with that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">meter invention</span> I suppose you have heard of.
                    O'Connor keeps on, but is badly off I fear. Burroughs is pretty well—We have had a long stretch of the finest
                weather, but to-day is dark &amp; wet &amp; glum enough—but I feel
                comparatively comfortable. I live on mutton-broth &amp; milk &amp; dry
                toast—sit up most of the day—have read Tolstoi &amp; (it seems to me)
                all Carlyle's letters—&amp; have enough. Much obliged with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Trans</span>[<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cript</span>] ¶ on big book—</p>
