                    wrote this note to Bucke on October 17, 1879, but in a letter to his wife, Bucke
                    wrote that he had received the post card from Whitman on Friday. October 17 fell
                    on a Friday in 1879, so Whitman must have written and mailed this letter at
                    least a day earlier. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_dbw.00001_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="dbw.00001_n1"><span>The letter from Bucke to
