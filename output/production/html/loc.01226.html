                unprofitable one to me so far. My domestic skies are not pleasant &amp; I seem
                depressed &amp; restless most of the time. I am interested in that Ernest Rhys—wish you had told me more about him. I should like to
                meet him if I know where he was to be seen. I saw an abstract of a lecture of his on
                the New Poetry, some months ago,<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01226.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01226.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01226.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> that contained an admirable statement about your poetry.

            <p class="tei_p">Two of the poems you enclosed were new to me. I liked them much. Your one to
                Whittier was very happy. A steady snow fall here
                to-day, the river a white plain. I dislike the winters more &amp; more &amp; shall
                not try to spend another in this solitude. Indeed I am thinking strongly of selling
