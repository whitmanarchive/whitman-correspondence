              (yourself, J W W[allace] &amp; Dr B[ucke])—thanks for 
                picts of Dr B, seem good—have just written a word to B.—Nothing very new—some favorable 
                features (&amp; g't easements &amp; reliefs they are)—but a glum week 
                the past &amp; present—have however eaten a fair b'kfast &amp; am sitting here
                in big chair by window—Mrs: D[avis] has gone for the
                day 4 miles to see some friends—Warry is here—all well—
