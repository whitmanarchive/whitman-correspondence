                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    he sent his essay "Old Actors, Singers, Shows, &amp;c., in New York" to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Truth</span>, a periodical in which his poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00048.html">Old Chants</a>" was published on March 19, 1891. Whitman told Horace
                    Traubel that he had asked for $16 in payment for the essay and had indicated
                    that he wanted the piece to appear in print the following week (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.42.html">Tuesday, March 24, 1891</a>). After a delay of several weeks, Traubel
                    recorded that a version of the piece had "at last appeared" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Truth</span>, where it filled only a single column (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With

                    He goes on to note that he was "confined" in his room while his foot was
