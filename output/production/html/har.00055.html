                    <p class="tei_p">The only evidence, which is hardly conclusive, that this note was sent to the
                        Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Advertiser</span> is the accession record in
                        the Houghton Library at Harvard. "As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free" was not
                        reprinted in this newspaper. However, on June 27, 1872, a correspondent may
                        have used part of Walt Whitman's blurb in his lengthy description of Walt
                        Whitman's appearance before the United Literary Society, where he followed
                        Edward Everett Hale: "He stood up bravely, but did not fill the entire house
                        with his voice. He appeared in his usual eccentric garb, and with a part of
                        his brawny breast bared and his long, white, gray hair and tawny beard, set
                        out by his Byronic collar, made his head and face a study.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">"Mr. Whitman calls his poem the 'thread-voice' or 'the spine' of a new series
                        of chants illustrating 'an aggregated, inseparable, unprecedented, vast,
                        composite, electric, democratic nationality,' to be published on some far
                        distant day in a book, and be a following of his 'Leaves of Grass,' which he
                        calls 'the song of a great, complete democratic individual.' He seeks to
                        demonstrate that America is to create a new literature, a new poetry, as
                        well as new inventions and power, and to show that the poet of the age must
                        sing vigorously of work, creation and development to be worthy of a hearing
                        in this great epoch. I fear his hearers hardly comprehended his lines, or
                        dreamed at what he was driving, and some in my immediate vicinity were so
                        ungracious as to comment upon it severely, terming it 'words, words,
                        meaningless,' while others characterized it, rather more roughly, 'stuff and
                        nonsense.' But at the close of the reading the compliment of hearty applause
                        was given it. The day must be considered an eventful one in the career of
                        Walt Whitman, for it brought him for the first time within the walls of a
                        college and before a college people."</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">A dispatch to the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> on June 29, 1872,
                        reported that Walt Whitman "was cordially met by the venerable gentlemen
                        sitting upon the platform. He then took his position at the desk and read,
                        with clearness of enunciation, his poem, written for the occasion, 'As a
                        Strong Bird on Pinions Free.' As Mr. Whitman himself said to the writer,
                        'There is no one expression that could stand as the subject of the poem.'"
