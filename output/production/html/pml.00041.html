      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">As I am sitting here alone in the parlor, the sun near setting pleasantly &amp; brightly, 
        (though cold to-day,) I just think that I ought to write you, even if but a line—that I am neglecting you—that perhaps you will be glad enough to hear from me. Well, 
        I am still here—still alive, after quite a many pretty hard pulls &amp; pressures—maintain pretty good spirits—which <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">would</span> be, quite 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">first-rate &amp; good</span>—but every day 
        &amp; every night comes the thought of my mother—I am not despondent or blue, nor disposed 
        to be any more <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ennuyeed​ </span></span></span> than ever—but that thought remains to temper the rest of my life.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am probably improving, though very slowly—go out a little most every day—go over to Philadelphia—get along pretty well in the cars &amp; crossing the ferry. 
        (The car fellows &amp; ferrymen are very kind &amp; helpful—almost all know me, I suppose instinctively)—appetite fair—rest at night tolerable—general strength better than at any time—(it is now just a year since I was paralyzed.) Can't use my left leg yet with any freedom—bad spells in the head too frequent yet—then, with all those, I am certainly encouraged 
        to believe I am on the gain. (But I am not out of the woods yet.) I write some—(must occupy my mind.) I am writing some pieces in the Weekly Graphic—my reminiscences 
        of war times—first number appears in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Weekly Graphic</span> of Jan. 24<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—three or four others to follow—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">We are in the new house my brother has built—very nice. I find myself <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very</span><a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lonesome</span> here, for all social &amp; emotional consolation—(Man cannot live on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bread alone</span>—can he?)—I want to come &amp; see you—must do so before long—want to pay a moderate board, 
        (same as I do here,) if convenient for you to have me—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Shall not come on any other condition</span>—Well, Abby, I have just <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">skurried​ </span></span></span> rapidly over the sheet, 
        &amp; will send it to you just as it is, with love.
