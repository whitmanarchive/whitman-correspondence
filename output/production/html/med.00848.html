            <p class="tei_p">I have made a rough and ready abstract of Sarrazin's piece (do
                you know that Sarrazin means "buckwheat"?) Will probably get it copied out and
                mailed tomorrow. If you have not yet sent Kennedys abstract to
                the printer wait till you get mine. Perhaps you will combine them.</p>
