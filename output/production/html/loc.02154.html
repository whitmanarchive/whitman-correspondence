            <p class="tei_p">Your good words (Jan 27–Feb 13) just <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ . Of course does me good to hear from you—(that anecdote of Lady
                Dilke too pleased me)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Every thing goes on pretty much the same with us here in Camden—my sister quite
                up to her standard of health—not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">plus</span>, but not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">minus</span> either—my brother a little on the plethoric,
                &amp; a little more <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">minus</span> than is desirable, but goes forth
                as usual every day—is building a house for their own occupancy on the little
                farm at Burlington—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I go out quite a good deal as guest to a charming Quaker
                family, R Pearsall Smith &amp; Mrs Smith at Germantown—a son &amp; two fine
                daughters—dear friends all—have fine drives—the elder daughter,
                20, is a great reader of L of G.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My books doing—L. of G. sales have been good—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span> not so good yet, but I am satisfied. (Wilson &amp; McCormick, St. Vincent St. Glasgow, are publishing S D for the British
                market)—Dr Bucke's book is in the hands of the printers here (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila</span>​ ) &amp; is
                to be published by David McKay, 23 South 9th St. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila</span>​ . Will be out in three or four

                here (Boston)—I have just glanced at them—I

            <p class="tei_p">I don't know where I shall flit to the coming summer—if I am well
                enough—Even as I write I receive a letter from John Burroughs, &amp; will just
                enclose it—dont want it again—(not as promising as I could wish)—if you can
                lay hands on the last <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> (March) read J. B's
                piece—I think very fine—best love to you—&amp; to dear Herb, and
                dear Giddy—The Staffords are all well—I havn't been down there in some months, but am going.</p>
