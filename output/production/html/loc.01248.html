            <p class="tei_p">Just a few lines of greeting and rememberance. Was glad to get y<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> card a few weeks ago. This is one of those warm spring like days wh. we
                not unfrequently have in winter time when the buds &amp; the birds seem almost ready
                to make a start again—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am in London for a week or two, partly to arrange about a third &amp; enlarged
                edition of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Toward Democracy,</span>

I expect to get <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01248.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01248.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01248.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> out by next March. That will about finish the book, and there
                will not be much added to it I believe afterwards.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had some good talks with Bucke when he was over, and he told
                me a bit about you, and about his book wh. he is
                bringing out. I guess, dear Walt, you have a tedious time of it on the
                whole—all those infirmities nagging don't leave the mind free for long. I got
                your Goodbye book—and like the poem from wh. it
                takes its name about the best of any in <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01248.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01248.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01248.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> it. "Goodbye—and hail!"
                After all the mind, the special local conciousness, is only a smallish part of
                oneself. It with all its troubles &amp; pains one may decently fold up in due time
                and put away in its appointed locker!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad you have such good friends with you—Mrs. Davis
                and Warry. Kind greetings also to them. I am still
                living at Millthorpe (near Sheffield) and having good times, with many dear friends.

                improves, like good wine.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to Harry Stafford if you ever write or see him. I
                don't hear from Herbert Gilchrist—tho' I sometimes get
                tidings of him. Should like to come over to U.S.A, but no prospect at present. With
                much love to you as ever</p>
