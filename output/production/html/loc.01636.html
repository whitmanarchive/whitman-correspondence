            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter this forenoon. Pete I thought I would send you a little change enclosed—all I have by me to-day—(but I have plenty at my command)—It is wet &amp; foggy to-day, 
                and a glaze of ice everywhere—so I am compelled to remain in. I am feeling decidedly 
                better the last 24 hours—Am surely getting through the winter very well—guess I shall come out with the frogs &amp; lilacs in the spring—I keep a bully good heart, 
                take it altogether—&amp; you must too my darling boy.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
