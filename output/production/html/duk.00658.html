                    <p class="tei_p">Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (1808–1875?) came to the United States from
                        Ireland as a young man. He edited a newspaper in New York and later had a
                        brief career on the stage. Subsequently he was a translator for the State
                        Department and a lecturer. He was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Travels in
                            the Southern States: Random Shots and Southern Breezes</span> (1842) and
                        translator of Compte de Paris' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of the Civil War in
                            America</span> (1875). On April 26, 1872, Walt Whitman inserted in the
                        Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Morning Chronicle</span> an appeal for
                        "pecuniary assistance for a man of genius," who was not named. On the
                        following day the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chronicle</span> noted "prompt
                        contributions" from, among others, Samuel Ward. According to Whitman's <a href="loc.01712">April 26, 1872</a> letter to Ward, Tasistro acted
                        as the carrier of Ward's money to Whitman.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                        1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., there are three
                        receipts written by Whitman and signed by Tasistro. On April 26, 1872,
                        Tasistro acknowledged $70. On April 29, 1872, he accepted an additional
                        $25, and on May 14, 1872, $10. On August 3, 1872, in his own hand,
                        Tasistro signed a receipt for $17. On the verso Walt Whitman noted the
                        total of $122: "also $10 more handed by W. W. to Mr. Tasistro." On
                        October 24, 1872, Walt Whitman wrote: "also about $25 more in different
                        sums since." See Edwin Haviland Miller, "Walt Whitman and Louis Fitzgerald
                        Tasistro," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Review</span>, 7 (March 1961),
