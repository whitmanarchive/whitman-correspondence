            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">The money you gave me for Mr. Tasistro has been handed by me to him, and has substantially helped him. I have been out to see him several times since I met you—he is up &amp; about &amp; in much better spirits—has great thoughts of getting well, &amp; going to work to earn his living himself.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">He has had a very hard time during the winter—Can never again be strong &amp; well—but has indomitable vitality.</p>
