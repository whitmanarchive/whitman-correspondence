                   Mrs. G—It is very interesting—Shall I bring or send it down for you to read, or have you one?—Harry left here ab't an 
                hour ago—he went up to the Hospital to-day, &amp; the throat was operated on again—but he feels pretty well &amp; 
                in good spirits—I am sorry to hear George and Ed are not well—I hope they
                will be over the worst of it, &amp; indeed all right by this time—I am
                going to New York to-morrowevn'g, to return Friday if I live through it all. I may drive down next
                Sunday if it is pleasant— </p>

                    this summer for he is going to America at the end of April,—going out as a
                    schoolmaster to settle somewhere up the Hudson. He is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet
                    earnest serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth,
                    whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a
                    clergyman, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00566_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00566_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00566_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and
                    this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the rest of his orthodox
                    family.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I posted a copy of my book to you about a week ago: I hope that you will read it and

                    particularly. As yet, I have not taken
                    my passage, but I hope to come early in May, and to spend a nice slice of my time
                    near you in Camden. I consider that your poems have gained ground here perceptibly
                    within the last 2 years. Leonard Brown sends his love &amp;</p>
