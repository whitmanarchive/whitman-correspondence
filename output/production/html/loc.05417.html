            <p class="tei_p">I received this postal from Mrs Nichols,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> the
                Superintendent of Blackwood,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> where Eddie<a href="#n1047" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1047">3</a> is, and thought you would like to hear from Eddie, and
                how he was doing. It was such a relief to me to know that all was right; as it has
                worried me so, I could not sleep. I have had a letter from Dr Reslin<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">4</a> of the Media Institute for feeble minded children, but there
                was nothing definite in it. I shall write again and if it is a better place, in
                three months we can change him, if they will take him. Hope you are well as usual.
                If you want to, you can forward this postal to Jeff<a href="#n4995" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4995">5</a> when you

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
