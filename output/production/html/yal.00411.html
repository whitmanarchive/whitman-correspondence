      <p class="tei_p">It is a dismal winter snow storm outside, and as I write I am sitting here by a good wood
        fire in the stove—have been alone all the evening—I sit up as much as I can,
        especially evenings—as I sleep better afterwards—I rec'd a letter from Jeff<a href="#n0710" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0710">1</a>

        usual—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been sitting up nearly all day—&amp; have less distress in the head than I
        have had—which is a great gain—I had a letter from Mrs. Price<a href="#n0483" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0483">6</a> to–day—she invites me to come &amp; stop awhile there, as soon as I can
        journey—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, it is kind of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">company</span> to write to you—it is very
        lonesome to sit here all the evening in my room—about 9 Charles Eldridge<a href="#n0210" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0210">7</a> comes in &amp; assists me to soak my feet in hot water, &amp; then I turn
        in—(I have my trowsers on this evening, first time in 3 weeks)—</p>

        as it is favorable weather I shall try to get <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">started</span> for
        outside—first, to get down stairs—&amp; then perhaps across the
        street—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">3 o'clock </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just got a letter from Jeff, which I enclose as it is the latest—Mrs.
          O'Connor<a href="#n0450" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0450">8</a> has just been to see me—brought a basket of nice
        things—</p>

        day to–day—it is moderate &amp; pleasant here, but mostly cloudy—I have
        been quite occupied writing several letters about business<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">11</a>—have set up all day, with the exception of an hour—Love to you, dear mother, </p>

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"

                    various social-reform movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle
                    factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four children — Arthur, Helen,
                    Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of age). During the 1860s, Price
                    and her family, especially her daughter, Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman
                    and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860 the Price family began to
                    save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard
                    Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia:
                    David McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters

                    163–169. In a letter to Ellen M. O'Connor on <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all
                        friends</span>, to prize and love deeply." Gay Wilson Allen notes that Edmund
                    Price owned a pickle factory on Front street, where the Whitmans had resided,
                    and he speculates that Whitman became acquainted with Abby through her speaking

                    Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
                    Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
                    and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
                    and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
                    William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
                    as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
