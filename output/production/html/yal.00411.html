        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">It is a dismal winter snow storm outside, and as I write I am sitting here by a good wood
        fire in the stove—have been alone all the evening—I sit up as much as I can,
        especially evenings—as I sleep better afterwards—I rec'd a letter from Jeff
        to–day, Matty was as well as at last
        accounts—about the same—no worse—I also rec'd a letter from Heyde—he said Han was well as
        usual—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been sitting up nearly all day—&amp; have less distress in the head than I
        have had—which is a great gain—I had a letter from Mrs. Price to–day—she invites me to come &amp; stop awhile there, as soon as I can
        journey—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, it is kind of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">company</span> to write to you—it is very
        lonesome to sit here all the evening in my room—about 9 Charles Eldridge comes in &amp; assists me to soak my feet in hot water, &amp; then I turn
        in—(I have my trowsers on this evening, first time in 3 weeks)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Friday noon <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>Feb. 14 </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am sitting up again to–day—passed a comfortable night, &amp; as soon
        as it is favorable weather I shall try to get <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">started</span> for
        outside—first, to get down stairs—&amp; then perhaps across the
        street—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">3 o'clock </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just got a letter from Jeff, which I enclose as it is the latest—Mrs.
          O'Connor has just been to see me—brought a basket of nice
        things—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—I send you Harper's &amp; Frank Leslie's—I am having a very fair
        day to–day—it is moderate &amp; pleasant here, but mostly cloudy—I have
        been quite occupied writing several letters about business—have set up all day, with the exception of an hour—Love to you, dear mother, </p>
