                    (1837–1902) was a Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to
                    Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later
                    memorizing it) and meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Bucke later served
                    as one of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the
                    relationship of Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Garland Publishing, 1998). Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919), an American
                    essayist, poet, and magazine publisher, is best remembered as the literary
                    executor and biographer of Walt Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until
                    Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited the poet virtually every day and took
                    thorough notes of their conversations, which he later transcribed and published
                    in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914). After his death, Traubel left behind
                    enough manuscripts for six more volumes of the series, the final two of which
                    were published in 1996. For more on Traubel, see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
