            <p class="tei_p">I have just sent the MS back by Adams express, same address as this letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You will be surprised, probably enraged, at the manner in which I have gone through
                it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Upon first looking over it I was divided between two courses—whether to send it
                back without revision at all—or to go over it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">with
                    decision</span> making all the corrections &amp; changes I felt entirely clear of.
                After deliberating I decided on the latter—I have acted upon it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Without explaining each particular point of elision or addition, I will only say that
                I am convinced if you accept &amp; print this copy as now arranged, you will bless
                your stars afterward—(printed in the old shape it would have turned out ill,
                and in very many things would probably have been unendorsed by you, as it certainly
                would by me.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The character you give me is not a true one in the main—I am by no means that
                benevolent, equable, happy creature you pourtray—but let that pass—I have left it as you wrote.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You will see what I have substituted for your argument on the sexual theme. Upon
                looking it over (pages 166 to 168) after an interval I am satisfied with it, and am
                willing to let those sections of my poems stand or fall on its support.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sure as I can be all of those elaborated and lengthy parts from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Man's Moral Nature</span> should be ruled out of this book &amp;
                referred to their own volume, where they are magnificent, (but an intrusion and
                superfluity here).<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> The whole MS. was far, far far too
                redundant—some things were often repeated three or four times—several
                long passages (very likely those you had set your heart on) were very much better
                out than in. Others would have been nuts to the caricature baboons—There were
                many errors or half-errors of fact.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But there is enough to make a very creditable, serviceable book—a permanent
                storehouse of many biographic, personal &amp; other things, and of your glowing
                &amp; penetrating criticism—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Upon the whole it will justify itself, and (as I have corrected it if you accept)
                will endure the test of both [readers?] &amp; the best critics of one, ten or fifty
                years hence—which is the main thing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Although the MS as it comes back may seem <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in a state</span> to your
                eyes, I assure you that the printers could take it just as it is, (all numbered with
                the folios in blue pencil) and get along with ease.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Finally as all the excised pages of the MS are returned (&amp; though it will need
                considerable writing &amp;c.) it can be restored entirely to the original form, if
                you should decide to do so.</p>
