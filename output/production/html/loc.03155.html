                <p class="tei_p">—The seventy-second<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a> birthday of Walt Whitman was celebrated at his home
                                in Camden, N.J., on the evening of May 31. About forty friends and admirers
                                sat down to a dinner, the poet occupying the seat of honor at the head.
                                He was in good health and spirits, and entertained his guests with
                                selections from his own works and comments on literary affairs. His opening
                                words were characteristic: "I feel to say a word of grateful memory

                                to publishers and magazine editors, and "were peremptorily rejected

                    friendly—almost fulsome, eulogistic: its head man was Abbot: I had several
                    letters from Abbot, written in a friendly temper: displaying a friendly feeling
                    for me. The other man, the money man, on The World, was Hines [...] At that time
                    [1880] they wanted me to send them something for an Emerson number of The World
                    [...] I sent them the piece— [...] But this friendly disposition came to
                    an end. There was a time when the question of W. W. came up—Abbot must
                    have been overborne: yet, whatever the policy of the paper, more recent letters
                    from Abbot—personal letters—have in substance repeated his original
                    judgment" (Charles E.

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,
