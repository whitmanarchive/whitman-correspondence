                I do sincerely hope you are very well and enjoying this fine June weather. I have
                read the copy of "Good-Bye, My Fancy" you gave me, and I am amazed and delighted with
                the great quality of its poetry. It is equal, much of it, to the best you have
                ever written.

                <p class="tei_p">—The seventy-second birthday of Walt Whitman was celebrated at his home
                                in Camden, N.J., on the evening of May 31. About forty friends and admirers
                                sat down to a dinner, the poet occupying the seat of honor at the head.
                                He was in good health and spirits, and entertained his guests with
                                selections from his own works and comments on literary affairs. His opening
                                words were characteristic: "I feel to say a word of grateful memory
                                for the big fellows just passed away—for Bryant and Emerson and
                           Longfellow; and for those we still have with us—Whittier, and the boss
                           of us all, Tennyson." Letters were read from Lord Tennyson, Richard Waterson Gilder,
                           Edmund Stedman, and others. Mr. Whitman has about ready what he considers
                                his last book, entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-bye, my Fancy</span>, and a
                                sub-title, "Second Annex to 'Leaves of Grass.'" It comprises sixty-six
                                pages of prose and verse. He says that many of his pieces were submitted
                                to publishers and magazine editors, and "were peremptorily rejected
                                by them." "To the Sunset Breeze" was rejected by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's</span>
                                as being an "improvisation" only, and "On Ye Jocund Twain" was returned
                                by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> as "personal merely."</p>
