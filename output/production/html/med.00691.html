                    returned from a two-month visit to England, as he informed Whitman in a post
                    card on <a href="loc.01181">August 9</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_sjs.00017_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="sjs.00017_n2"><span>Before Rees Welsh &amp;
                    Co. became his publisher, Whitman bound some of the "sheets" which he had
                    received from Osgood (see the letter from Whitman to Burroughs of <a href="hun.00054">April 28, 1882</a>). Goldsmith estimated that only
                    fifty copies of this "edition" were issued (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston, New York: Houghton
                    Mifflin, 1931], 210n). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_sjs.00017_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="sjs.00017_n3"><span>Late in June, apparently,
                    Burroughs informed O'Connor that Rossetti now called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> "nasty"; see O'Connor's letter to Burroughs on July 12 (Barrus,
                    220). On <a href="loc.03061">July 13</a> O'Connor wrote to Whitman of
                    Rossetti's recantation: "It is sad and sickening." On <a href="loc.01144">August 24</a> Burroughs explained the situation to Whitman: "Yes, I was
                    much put out with Wm Rossetti; it was not so much what he said about your poems,
                    . . . but his manner, his coldness, his indifference. He did not even ask about
                    your health, or any other human thing, &amp; made me feel that my call upon him,
                    miserable petrefied cockney that he is, was an unwelcome interruption."
                    Apparently Rossetti and Burroughs, in Whitman's words, "did not seem altogether
                    to hit it" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>
                    [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:437). When Rossetti wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.03606">January 1, 1885</a>, his praise of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> was unstinted
                    (Traubel, 1:436–437). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_sjs.00017_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="sjs.00017_n4"><span>This is Whitman's only

                    letter to O'Connor on October 14, he was withholding his book at Whitman's
                    suggestion. In fact, although he carefully refrained from saying so, Bucke was
                    not happy about Whitman's vague plans for the publication of his study by Rees
                    Welsh &amp; Co. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
