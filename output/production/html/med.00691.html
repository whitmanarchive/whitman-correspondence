            <p class="tei_p">I commenced publishing L of G in June on my own hook, but found it vexatious from the
                    start, &amp; having quite vehement proposals from
                Rees Welsh, (2d hand book dealer &amp; law book publisher) 23 South 9th St. Phila. I
                pass'd the use of the plates into his hands—he printed it (the plates are here
                 in Phila) an exact copy of the Osgood edition—Welsh's first edition (a
                cautious 1000) was ready ab't three weeks ago &amp; was exhausted in a day—the
                second came in ab't five days ago, &amp; is now nearly gone—a third is
                ordered—I am glad I let him have it—</p>

                just on the same terms as of yore)—When you have a
