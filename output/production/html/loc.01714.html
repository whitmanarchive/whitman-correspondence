          </span> 

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of Feb. 8, '73, remitting my <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​ , and sales up to 1st of June, '72, 
                (with check of $12:60) was duly acknowledged at time. If convenient, could you advise me, 
                or get Messrs. Lee, Shephard, &amp; Dillingham<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
                to advise me, of sales by them since that time, 
                and to remit me the amount? Also how many books are now on hand.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Also please return me, if convenient, the printed slip I forwarded you of my last <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't.</span>​  with you, marked in blue pencil "return this."
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I would also like to inquire of Messrs. Lee, Shephard &amp; Dillingham whether 
                they would not take my books, (the new editions) &amp; job them. Redfield sent me word 
                that Mr. Dillingham declined, thinking there was no inducement, but I am in hopes he will still take them.
            </p>
