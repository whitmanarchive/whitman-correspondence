                Ideal physical conditions, perfect mental and spiritual equilibrium in the pure
                hearted Mother, have given the dear little baby girl such a start in life as I wish
                were possible for every human being—the little one will surely be a power for
                good in the future. Just now however, she makes a noise in the world very similar to
                that by which other tiny infants make known their wants. Grace herself is just
                lovely, and with her baby by her side, is a subject such as would have inspired a

                "Alma" is after dear Mother,<a href="#n3029" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3029">7</a> of course. The children are all as
                proud as can be of the newcomer, and the acme of happiness is reached when allowed

                        23, 1863</a>. Swinton's enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On <a href="loc.01955">September 25, 1868</a>, Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly
                    impressed with the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you.
                    I read this afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never
                    before read. I could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more
                    to me than all other books and poetry." On <a href="loc.01957">June 23,
                        1874</a>, Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter":
                    "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the
                    'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street,
                    Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something
                    that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me,
                    grown around me, and grown into me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt

                    36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
                    for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the
