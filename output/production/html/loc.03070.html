            <p class="tei_p">I have sent you the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">MS</span> of my letter to Bucke. It goes this day by Adams' Express,
                addressed to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent you a card this morning just before your letter came. There is not the least
                bit of "pestering" in the matter, and of course I appreciate the necessity for
                despatch. I only got

                set to work revising it the next day. I am so driven with work, and so weary and
                worn, that I cannot always be as quick as I would like to in these offices. The
                collection of my anti-Comstock letters has been positively prevented up to date, by
                simple lack of time. I shall soon have some let up. We have had a horrid fight with

                flaxed them awfully—rousing Congress and the Seaboard upon them. I send you a
                pamphlet, which has some of the shrapnel we swept their decks with. The paper on
                Life-Saving transfer is mine—some touches in the others. I was thinking of you
                when I wrote the first and third of my three reasons against transfer.</p>

                glad to leave out some sentences in the last page, and originally intended to, but
                thinking it over, could not see my way clear, inasmuch as the whole publication is a
                matter of history, and ought to stand, follies and all, and several of my abusive
                critics at the time quoted the very passages I want to omit, for animadversion,
                which makes it more difficult

                now to withdraw them. Do you see my dilemma? The sentences
                sending the pamphlet to a number of persons named on the last page, are an
                absurdity, yet I don't see very well how I can honorably back out of it now, and
                escape twitting. How does this view strike you?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was Bucke's wish that I should write the prefaratory letter I send, and I accepted

                my respects to some of your recent critics, teaching them that there are blows to
                take as well as give; and of putting you, where you properly belong, in the line
                of succession from Shakespeare, which will make some of our literati howl. I hope

                     effective. Like everything I write, it has been done in a
                hurry, and without those leisures of the soul which are requisite to satisfactory
                work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I trust it will be in good type. Where is it to go? The pamphlet, of course, belongs

                on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">after</span> the pamphlet in the appendix. Bucke wanted it at first, but in his last
                letter thinks it best to omit it, although he leaves it to me. Now I think it ought
                to go in, as it finishes the Harlan affair handsomely. But do as you think best. It
                is a rather crushing rejoinder to Lanman, and a punishment to Stoddard, who is
                awfully mean, and it has a good effect of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">tone</span> after the

                     want to see the volume. The
                letter, as printed, is very characteristic of Emerson—his reserve, his
                shrinking, like a woman's, because of rebuff; his deceptive concessions to the
                enemy, in a vein of pleasantry, almost like irony, almost like a sneer, when he says
                the book "wanted good morals so much" that he did not send it. Of

                     course, some
                people will take a different view. But I think I understand Emerson's real feeling,
                which is in his first letter to you, and there is no denying it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am suspicious of Professor Norton as an editor of this correspondence. I hope he

                     which he held that the later Greek
                sculpture began to be indecent with nudity—the great or earlier Greek being
                always draped, as in the work of Phidias; which precious assertion made me think of
                the Panathenaic frieze of Phidias where a row of soldiers charges, all naked, and the
                phallus in each man not only bare, but erected—stiff with valor—which is
                good for Professor Norton! Selah! I must close. More anon.</p>
