            <p class="tei_p">I have received the letter asking me to write for the "Broadway". 
                I do not write much, but your invitation is cordially appreciated, 
                and may serve as the spur toward something. I can at present only 
                briefly say that should I be able to prepare an article, or poem, 
                appropriate for the purposes of the magazine, 
                I will send it on—&amp; that I shall surely try to do so.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My address is at the Attorney General's office here. 
                (New York house, please forward this to Mr. Edmund Routledge, London.)
