                    February 9, 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter February 9, and
                    Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1871. However, Edwin Haviland Miller
                    dated a letter, presumably this one, February 8, 1871 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:368). The month and year are certain because the letter refers
                    to the "hudson river horror," which matches a train disaster that occurred on
                    February 7, 1871. No other letter can date to February 9, 1871, so Miller's date
                    February 8 is an error. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
