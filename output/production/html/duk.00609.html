            hand and wrist you can see by my
            writing it looks some like yours walt

            was the best i think he ever wrote
            he always when he writes to me begins
            with mrs whitman this was commenced
            with dear mother whitman he said
                han had two letters from walt and
            by what he said she was pretty well
             i thought to myself when i read his
             letter has charley heyde got relegion
            it was so different from his former
            letters probably the next will be the old stile
