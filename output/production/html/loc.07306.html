            <p class="tei_p">I have today the new L. of G. "31 May 1889." It is a lovely little book. I am
                thoroughly delighted with it. I have a few cuttings from eastern papers this evening
                (sent by a friend) in re dinner. Very glad to see that you were actually present and
                (more than I expected) spoke a few words. I shall hope to have the papers in full
                and some short account of the affair in M.S. from you or Horace. I judge from what I
                see in the papers that the dinner was a success. I am rejoiced, dear friend, that
                you have stayed with us to get out the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">big</span> and the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">last</span> eds. and for this dinner It will surely be patent
                to all now that you have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">come to stay</span>—patent 
                or not to the rest it is to me an evident fact. It is wonderfull<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00602.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00602.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00602.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                how much more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">grip</span> you seem to have on the world now
                than even five years ago and the last year even has made an immense difference. Yes,
                Walt, you are undoubtedly <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">an institution</span> and if I live
                another twenty years (which is very doubtful!) I shall not be surprised to see my
                highest claims for you (for making which I have been counted a lunatic) broadly and
                even generally allowed. My copy of Sarrazin has come to hand by the afternoon's
                mail—it is as you said, a lovely little book. Our spell of dark, cold, rainy
                weather has let up at last and we have summer again—not very warm yet but
                getting warm—it is now 5 P.M. a charming warm, bright evening: our lilacs
                are out and the grounds look well</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, dear Walt</span>
