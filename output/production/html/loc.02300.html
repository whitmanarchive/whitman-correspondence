                for which many thanks.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">In the third paragraph you say that there is something about the essential traits of
                our aborigines which "will almost certainly never be transmitted to the future." If

                among them &amp; shall endeavor to perpetuate on canvas some of the finer types,
                both men &amp; women &amp; some of the characteristic features of their life. It
                will certainly be well worth the while. My artistic enthusiasm was never so
                thoroughly stirred up as by the indians They certainly have more of beauty dignity
                &amp; nobility mingled with their own wild individuality than any of the other

                hold a candle to the Indian. All of the other aboriginal types seem to be more or
                less distorted from the model of perfect human form—as we know it—the
                Blacks, thin-hipped, with bulbous limbs, not well marked; the Arabs large jointed

                to the artistic perceptions &amp; demand.</p>

Ten thousand
                photographs would not have the value of one really finely felt painting. Color is
                all important. No one but an artist knows how much. An indian is only half an indian
                without the blue-black hair &amp; the brilliant eyes shining out of the wonderful
                dusky ochre &amp; rose complexion. Photo's are but for records at the best &amp; if the Lord permits I shall give people some thing better to remember the Navajos &amp;
                Apaches by. With renewed thanks for your kindness in sending me the article I
