            <p class="tei_p">Coming home from our "Athenaeum"—a great reading union with a large 
                number of papers and periodicals from all countries of the earth—and having there with 
                great pleasure read in the Norwegian "Aftenbladet" (Evening Paper) for 
                April 1 the the first <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">real</span> criticism of your book, I found on my table 
                your kind letter of March 19, in reply to which I immediately write 
                these lines to let you know the fact.

                The author is a young man in my years; his name is Kristian Elster, he is 
                living at present in Throndhjeim (English: Drontheim). I received a letter from him this morning 
                of March 28 announcing that he had written the criticism but expressing a great fear that the 
                editor (in Christiania) would not print it. In the war, on the roaring sea the Norwegians are 
                a people of heroes; but in their civil and literary life they are a race of cowards. Either the 
                author or the editor will forward a copy of the number to you. I will beg you to let it be 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">carefully</span> translated to you. Elster speaks of a certain affinity between 
                the author and his translator, others have made

                The last paper (people's paper) is <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aja">slang</span> 
                and the editor is the clown of the basest Copenhagen public.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All the other critics have been in the same case with you as during many years our critics have 
                been with Grundtvig: when the objections against the books are exhausted, 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the man</span> is standing there invulnerable against all the darted arrows and 
                imposing the critic himself!</p>
