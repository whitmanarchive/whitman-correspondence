            <p class="tei_p">I wrote to Han last Saturday. I hope you manage to keep comfortable this cold
                winter—it must be pretty tough up there on that bleak hill—It has been
                very cold here, but I have not minded it—My thick overcoat that Nelson made comes in first-rate this winter—it is
                quite good yet—I have not bought any new clothes for a long
                while—suppose I must get some next spring.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is a Bill before Congress to give extra pay to the clerks—if it passes I
                shall have something extra, too—but I make no calculations on it, for I think
                it quite uncertain. The debates in Congress now are quite exciting—sometimes
                they hold their sessions quite late in the night, &amp; things get to be quite
                stormy. William Hunter (who is in the House, from Brooklyn, to fill out James
                Humphrey's term)
                called a Republican member "a liar"—so the Speaker had Mr. Hunter up before
                him &amp; gave him a formal reprimand—it was last Saturday. Mrs. Mix went that cold Friday night, twelve days ago—I have
                not heard from her. It was a bad night for a journey, &amp; the track was blocked
                with snow.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I receive letters from the soldiers every now &amp; then. Within a week I have had
                two invitations—one is from a young fellow named Alfred Pratt. I knew him in one of the hospitals two years ago,
                &amp; more. His folks are farming people out in northwestern New York, near the
                shores of Lake Erie—he writes half the letter, &amp; his father &amp; mother
                write the other half, inviting me to come there &amp; pay them a visit—the
                parents say they "will do every thing they can to make a country visit
                agreeable"—the letter is very old fashioned, but very good. Then I had
                another invitation, from a Michigan boy. He has got married, &amp; has a small farm,
                not far from Detroit.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Do you remember Lewis Brown, the Maryland boy, who had such a time
                with his leg, &amp; had it amputated at last in Armory Square hospital? He is quite
                well otherwise, &amp; has got a place in the Treasury Dep't. I send the
                advertisement of the new book about the Ninth Corps—if George wants it, I
                think he can find it at the American News Co. 121 Nassau st. New York—We have ill luck among the clerks &amp;c in
                our office—I send a little slip from the Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span>—then another
                clerk, Mr. Rowland, is lying very sick. It is doubtful if he recovers. Wm. O'Connor has just
                been in to see me—He is well &amp; flourishing.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Mother, no letter from you the past week—</p>
