            <p class="tei_p">This is the paper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: Boughs</span> is to be printed on—isn't
                it fine &amp; thick? This is the (untrimm'd) size of page—the large book is
                thinner (same pulp) and a bittock larger—all those
                matters are going smoothly—</p>

                continues—perhaps when the weather grows cooler, I may be better—but I
                don't know but I am failing to anticipate any essential change—Your good
                letters come daily—y'r suggestions &amp;c. will if possible be
                followed—rec'd to-day a basket of pears from John Burroughs—good weather—a rain in prospect—best wishes to the meter—</p>
