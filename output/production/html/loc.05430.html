                    1884 graduate of the University of California, who wrote poetry and visited
                    Whitman on May 13, 1890, while setting out on a trip to California. Whitman
                    wrote letters to him and sent him a copy of his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems
                        &amp; Prose</span>, but there is minimal information about what his
                    "proposition" to Whitman was, and he remains something of a mystery. Whitman
                    related his impressions of Lezinsky to Horace Traubel, saying of Lezinsky, "The
                    tone of the man—his startling propositions, all confound me. As I
                    understand, he comes from California, must have money, has become possessed of
                    ideas about Walt Whitman. Today he went off to Washington, to be back again in
                    several days. Why, Horace, you have no idea of the exuberance of the man: he
                    talks of buying all my books, of buying a share in the copyrights, paying me
                    several thousand dollars, having me write no more but by consultation with him:
                    a series of surprising stipulations" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With

The
                    volume was published by the poet himself in an arrangement with publisher David
                    McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves

                    1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding
                    decisions, and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo
                    of the poet on the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom,

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
