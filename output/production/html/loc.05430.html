            <p class="tei_p">I am here yet much the same as when you saw me—perhaps two or three pegs let lower (from time 
                &amp; age,) but essentially "the same subject continued"—have spells of pretty severe depression 
                &amp; illness &amp; then get back again to condition such as it is—have the grip permanently—I 
                sent from here (4th June last—also letter to you) some of my big books 
                (complete works) by express, directed to you care OK Lerris, Hotel, Butte City Montana. Did you get 
                them? (I rec'd the money safe, &amp; order)—Also rec'd y'r letter f'm Berkley, 
                some three months ago, &amp; ans'd it wh' I suppose you rec'd—was very ill 
                when y'r letter came &amp; for three weeks on—I send (some mail with this) newspaper report of 
                Robt G. Ingersoll's lecture in Phil ab't L of G. Have 
                not seen Ed Stead the driver lately, but I guess he is all right. Mrs. Davis, 
                my housekeeper, is well—She has been off to Kansas &amp; Colorado on a jaunt—Warren Fritzinger 
                my nurse is still with me &amp; is well—the forthcoming (Nov.) N A Review 
                has a little piece of mine "Old Poets"—As I write I am sitting here 
                in my big chair with wolf skin on back of it—dark &amp; chilly day—have had buckwheat cakes 
                &amp; coffee for breakfast—</p>
