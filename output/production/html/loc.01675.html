            <p class="tei_p">—I am still keeping pretty well for me, have improved much indeed, quite fat, and all sun burnt brick red in the face, &amp; hands as brown as nuts—am pretty lame &amp; paralyzed yet, but walk or rather hobble sometimes half a mile, &amp; have no more (or hardly ever) of those bad prostrated gone-in, faint spells I used to have most every day—so you see I am doing pretty well, my dear<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>—I still make my brother's house at Camden my headquarters, &amp; keep my room there—address my letters to Camden always—But my sister is not well, has not been for some weeks, (is soon to lie confined)—Upon the whole, am getting along pretty well, &amp; good spirits</p>
