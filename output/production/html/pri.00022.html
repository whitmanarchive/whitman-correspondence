                is rather slow in getting ready to be sent to subscribers, but will very soon be ready, &amp; all 
                the good friends &amp; subscribers will have their copies carefully sent to their addresses by mail 
                prepaid, (as I find this is the best way)—There were really only 100 of the first edition
