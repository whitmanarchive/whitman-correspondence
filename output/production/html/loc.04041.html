                    <p class="tei_p">Robert G. Ingersoll (1833–1899), the noted lawyer and agnostic, sent on
                            <a href="man.00026">March 25, 1880</a>, what Whitman termed a
                        "cordial, flattering, affectionate letter" (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
                        Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                        1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Whitman heard Ingersoll lecture, evidently for the first time, on May 25:
                        "talked afterward with him a few minutes" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On
                        May 26 the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> noted that "Walt
                        Whitman . . . drank deep draughts of the orator's eloquence," and
                        interpolated into its reprint of the text at several points, "['Amen' from
                        Walt Whitman.]" On the following day Richard Maurice Bucke, who had
                        accompanied the poet, denied that Whitman had showed either approval or
                        disapproval. See also Whitman's comments on Ingersoll's religious views in
                        his letter to Harry Stafford of <a href="hyb.00011">January 27,
                            1881</a>.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
