            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I want to hear about you all,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; about George &amp; how he is spending his time home—Mother, I do hope you are well &amp; in good spirits &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all, &amp; dear little California &amp; Hattie—I send them all my love—Mother, I may write to you from down in front—so good bye, dear mother, for present—</p>
