            <p class="tei_p">I am going down in front, in the midst of the Army, to-morrow morning, to be gone for about a week—so I thought I would write you a few lines now, to let you know—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I suppose you got my letter written last Tuesday—I have not got any from home now for a number of days—I am well &amp; hearty—the young man Lewis Brown is able to be up a little on crutches—there are quite a number of sick young men, I have taken in hand, from the late arrivals, that I am sorry to leave—sick &amp; downhearted &amp; lonesome, they think so much of a friend, &amp; I get so attached to them too—but I want to go down in camp once more very much—&amp; I think I shall be back in a week—I shall spend most of my time among the sick &amp; wounded in the Camp hospitals—if I had means I should stop with them, poor boys, or go down among them periodically, dispensing what I had, as long as the war lasts, down among the worst of it—(although what are collected here in hospital, seem to me about as severe and needy cases as any after all)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I want to hear about you all, &amp; about George &amp; how he is spending his time home—Mother, I do hope you are well &amp; in good spirits &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all, &amp; dear little California &amp; Hattie—I send them all my love—Mother, I may write to you from down in front—so good bye, dear mother, for present—</p>
