            <p class="tei_p">Had for dinner stewed blackberries—a favorite tipple of mine—and boiled
                rice. . . . Sidney Morse has made a second big head—an
                improvement, if I dare say so, on the first. The second is the modern spirit, awake
                &amp; alert as well as calm—contrasted with the antique &amp; Egyptian
                calmness &amp; rest of the first. We have decided on the second.</p>
