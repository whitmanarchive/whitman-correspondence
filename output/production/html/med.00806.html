                improvement, if I dare say so, on the first. The second is the modern spirit, awake

                calmness &amp; rest of the first. We have decided on the second.</p>

                    Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
                    (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
                    and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
                    Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
                    was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
                    advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and
