            <p class="tei_p">Just a few lines to acknowledge the receipt of the "Camden Daily Courier" for June
                2nd 1883 "Unity" Aug 28th 1890 &amp; the accompanying slips "Of that blithe throat
                of thine" "Yonnondio" "Halcyon Days" &amp; "The voice of the rain." The 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Daily Courier</span> is of especial interest as containing an
                admirable critique of Dr Bucke's book &amp; I fear in sending it to me you have
                despoiled yourself of one of your treasures but

            this will all the more enhance its value to me and I desire to thank you very

            <p class="tei_p">Mr Wallace has kindly shewn me the post card he received from you on Sept 12<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> from
                which I am extremely sorry to learn that you are suffering from an attack of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Grippe</span>—though from the fact that you were not then
                confined to the house we are in hopes that it is not a very severe one &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">we both hope</span> that
                it has by this time passed off &amp; left no bad effects upon you. We hope to hear

            <p class="tei_p">We have seen the French article in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Universal</span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Review</span>—in fact I have the number containing it.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We have had a glorious day for our out-of-door meeting—an ideally perfect day.
                Nearly all "the boys" were present with two friends &amp; the reading of my notes
                &amp;c which took place in a green field beneath a tree, occupied nearly two hours
                &amp; was much enjoyed by every one &amp; by none more than myself for I seemed to
                be living over again the happy time I spent with you Much were they all
                interested in all I had to say &amp; much do they appreciate

            all your kindness to me &amp; thro me to them. They esteem it a high honour to have
                been medially brought into personal contact with you &amp; Mr Wallace has been
