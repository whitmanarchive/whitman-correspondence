            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I never meant my last poor postal to be the answer to yr kind page-letter. And now
                that I am taking a vacation of six weeks to write the bk I told you of, I must bore
                you with a letter—just to say how'd'e, &amp; to tell you that my staunch little
                dame, my brave frau<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_blh">kin</span> is going to
                make a little visiting tour, &amp; will some day make you a little call (second reading: a profusion of "little's"
                    in here by mistake!) (in abt' two 2 weeks) if agreeable. She is of the cheery-shy kind,
                &amp; will do you good. But if it shd so happen that you sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>
                not feel like seeing anybody on the day she comes, she wants me to say that she will
                not feel in the least grudgy—any more than I shall, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ktl">ever</span>, if I shall happen
                to knock at yr door on the wrong day.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">I feel like myself again, now I am out for a vacation—like a man escaped fr.
                the penitentiary. I inquired at the stores for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Liberty</span>,
                but it is not to be had at any of the news stands in Boston, no satire intended! (second reading of this
                        over) I will stop in to
                see "Ben" himself next time I go in.—Traubel has not
                written me for some time. I miss his letters.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hooray! for my freedom! [Here I cut a caper] Now for six weeks of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">thought</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote to F. Wilson yesterday, asking him to either

            <p class="tei_p">I feel that I have broadened &amp; deepened my knowledge of human nature amazingly by the
                past two years of shoulder to shoulder work with the (to me) entirely hitherto unfamiliar class of skilled city mechanics
                (&amp; proof-readers). I feel much stronger in digestion &amp; in sinew, &amp; in character;
                self-reliant: nothing like it: to be able to snap yr fingers at cant, compromise,
                the sneaks of the profession, &amp;c.</p>

                ten new choice roses, &amp; they are now 5 inches high. My gloire di Dijon rose has
                grown 12 feet high in many rigorous shoots.</p>

                    Scott. Manly adventure is the theme—and love. But <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">especially</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">comradeship</span>:
                it is yr calamus doctrine embodied in a faint &amp; inferior degree (the Gallic nature
