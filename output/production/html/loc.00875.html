         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> have not seen your friend Babbitt since he left the Mason Hospital (about the time I wrote you before); but I have been there to inquire about him<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>.  Three days ago I called, and a soldier who had recently seen him reported him as gradually regaining his strength, though not his voice.  He is able to go out a little.  He is with, or near, some good friends of his, who are no doubt a comfort to him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What you write me of yourself and of your experiences, interests me and makes me almost envy you the privilege of being with our noble unfortunate soldiers.  You ought to write the epic of this war.  By the way, has anything been done with Drum Taps?  O'Connor<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> said he would communicate with Carleton<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> on the subject.  I have spoken with one publisher here about them; but he did not bite.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">An item of great domestic importance to us will perhaps interest you.  A boy was born to me yesterday—a lusty little chap, fat, well-formed, weight ten pounds.  Mother doing well thus far.  I have seen the new moon over my right shoulder to some purpose lately.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A few days ago I wrote a letter about you to Secretary Chase<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>.  I hope you will yet hear from him.  He acknowledged at the time the receipt of the book you handed him; so I knew the package must have reached you.  I am heartily glad if the books have been put to any use.  How is your friend Brown who was to lose his foot?<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>

                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
                    gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry Boy and the
                        Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
                    had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the <a href="nar.00002">January 10,
                    1863</a>. Though
                    Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every
                    year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and
                    greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A.
                    Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>,
                    23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman

                    stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
                    D. O'Connor. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00875_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00875_n2"><span>As Whitman informed Margaret
                    S. Curtis in a letter from <a href="loc.00801">October 28, 1863</a>, Caleb
                    Babbitt suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square
                    Hospital. According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library),
                    Babbitt had been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left
                    Washington on furlough. On <a href="nyp.00143">August 18, 1863</a>,
                    Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre,
                    Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary
                    acknowledged Whitman's letter on <a href="nyp.00145">September 6,
                    1863</a>, and wrote that Caleb was "not quite as well as when I wrote you
                    before…he wishes me to tell you to keep writing…for your letters do him more
                    good than a great deal of medicine." On <a href="nyp.00146">September 18,
                        1863</a>, at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong
                    enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking
                    with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but
                    it is nothing compared with the original." On <a href="nyp.00148">October
                        18, 1863</a>, Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in
                    my pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he
                    mentioned his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On <a href="nyp.00150">October 26, 1863</a>, S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from
                    the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp;
                    suffers considerable pain In his
                    head."

                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
                    deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
                    hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
                    presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
                    single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
                    seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
                    the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
                    people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
                    against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
                    collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
                    flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
                    memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton,
                    1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman wrote on <a href="loc.00415">June 13, 1863</a>: "I am
                    real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
                    in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
                    twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
                    there are still people of that kind left." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00875_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00875_n4"><span>Trowbridge refers here to
                    the New York publisher, George Carleton. In 1867 Carleton would pass on an
                    opportunity to publish a new edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.
                    Within about a month, Carleton "had the distinction of turning down both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and Mark Twain's first book"; Carleton
                    later dubbed himself "the prize ass of the nineteenth century." See Justin

                    (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
                    August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
                    transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
                    February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
                    February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
                    and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
                    January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
                    Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from <a href="nyp.00193">September 11, 1864</a>
                    . The following
                    September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
                    of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
                    in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
                    family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
