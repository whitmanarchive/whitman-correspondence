                nearly all the time—very moderate temperature (but cold probably by the time
                you get this)—I guess matters physiological are as well with me as could be
                expected <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">considering</span>—when exhilarated with visitors or
                friends here I probably feel &amp; throw out sort o' extra (wh' probably acc'ts for
                Horace's glowing picture probably having a very flimsy
                background or none at all)—the main things are a pretty good (born) heart
                &amp; stalwart genesis—constitution—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">these the main
                factors</span>—Keeping hearty—Y'r letters
