            <p class="tei_p">Being a professed Associationist I am allowed the liberty of following my
                attractions, when they are, what all the world will say, harmless, even in despite
                of common etiquette which would demand a longer delay before answering your good
                letter of the 20th. Hector wished me to leave it with
                him for a few days and so 'tis not before me or I might take up the several points
                of interest in order, but no matter I feel like writing to you, and the order may
                come some other time, I cannot help feeling a little gratified at finding that I am
                not so different from other thinking people, in that I am disposed to think some bad
                things of myself, we ought not to be partial to ourselves, ought we? in your case
                however I must say that I think your judgment of yourself is rather severe, I have
                not changed my opinion, which I gave you when speaking of the false report of
                    Emmersons fastidiousness <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00692_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00692_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00692_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> that if he or any one else expected
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">common</span> etiquette from you, after having read Leaves of
                Grass they were sadly mistaken in your character where etiquette, or what is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">called</span> refined and exquisite taste <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">predominate</span>. I never expect to find much originality of character, however
                this is rather an implication where I did not intend it I will have none of it, but
                try to be myself</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I entirely coincide with you in what will be the result of greater experience on the
                part of the exponents of the two views of matter &amp; spirit as to the priority of
                either. I find them always coexisting, and do not intend to trouble myself for any
                other solution, I only ask to use in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">refference​ </span><span class="tei_corr">reference​
        
      </span></span> to each, the terms that will convey my ideas to the minds of others as
                truely as I am capable of conveying them. I do think that the greater part of the
                difficulties that exist among men on <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">all most​ </span><span class="tei_corr">almost​

      </span></span> subjects arise from the different modes of expressing the same ideas.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad you have been to see Mrs W. I felt the same sympathy for her, her life

                governing faculty, but in man reason predominates &amp; must govern, no matter what
                mere instinct proposes as a means of happiness. if the great family is not ready to
                go with the idea, we must yield to their needs, we can not, ought not, live

            <p class="tei_p">You have made my heart rejoice by telling me of the breadth of the Revd Mr Porter, is it? (I have not the letter here) verily us, would be

                feel and to say, (and why should I not say it?) Thank God for the great influx of
                light, love, joy, and beauty which is every where manifest. I can not help comparing
                the present with past <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">earas​ </span><span class="tei_corr">eras​
        
      </span></span> of cruelty and carnage. When men dare not express a thought outside the

                am running on, as if I were writing to school boy who had never thought all these
                childish things. but you will forgive me since 'tis myself, and I will try to do
                better</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There was one expression in your letter, which I hope you will allow me to refer too,
                in good faith. You say that Fowler &amp; Wells are not
                the right men to publish Leaves of Grass. I am sure they are not, I can tell you
                more of their malpractice about it, when you come. You say also that they are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">willing</span> to give up the plates, now it occured to me that
                it was quite possible that some <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">trifeling​ </span><span class="tei_corr">trifling​
        
      </span></span> money consideration prevented you from obtaining them, and although I have
                now but little money at my command I thought I would take the liberty of saying to
                you that if the small sum of Fifty Dollars would be of any use to you for the
                purpose I should be most happy to send that amount to you. I feel that I shall be
                understood and therefore make no apology.</p>
