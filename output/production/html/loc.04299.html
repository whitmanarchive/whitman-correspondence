            <p class="tei_p">Being a professed Associationist I am allowed the liberty of following my
                attractions, when they are, what all the world will say, harmless, even in despite
                of common etiquette which would demand a longer delay before answering your good
                letter of the 20th. Hector<a href="#n18" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r18">1</a> wished me to leave it with
                him for a few days and so 'tis not before me or I might take up the several points
                of interest in order, but no matter I feel like writing to you, and the order may
                come some other time, I cannot help feeling a little gratified at finding that I am
                not so different from other thinking people, in that I am disposed to think some bad
                things of myself, we ought not to be partial to ourselves, ought we? in your case
                however I must say that I think your judgment of yourself is rather severe, I have
                not changed my opinion, which I gave you when speaking of the false report of

I never expect to find much originality of character, however
                this is rather an implication where I did not intend it I will have none of it, but
                try to be myself</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I entirely coincide with you in what will be the result of greater experience on the
                part of the exponents of the two views of matter &amp; spirit as to the priority of
                either. I find them always coexisting, and do not intend to trouble myself for any
                other solution, I only ask to use in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">refference​ </span></span> to each, the terms that will convey my ideas to the minds of others as
                truely as I am capable of conveying them. I do think that the greater part of the

                the right men to publish Leaves of Grass. I am sure they are not, I can tell you
                more of their malpractice about it, when you come. You say also that they are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">willing</span> to give up the plates, now it occured to me that
                it was quite possible that some <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">trifeling​ </span></span> money consideration prevented you from obtaining them, and although I have
                now but little money at my command I thought I would take the liberty of saying to
                you that if the small sum of Fifty Dollars would be of any use to you for the
                purpose I should be most happy to send that amount to you. I feel that I shall be
