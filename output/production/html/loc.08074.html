                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

This letter gives
                    a detailed account of nineteenth-century sentimental camaraderie. In the middle
                    of the reception in honor of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke's visit to Bolton, the
                    boys sang a song to the tune of "The March of the Men of Harlech," a Welsh
                    national air. Wentworth Dixon, a lawyer's clerk and member of the Bolton College
                    of Whitman admirers, composed the lyrics to the song, which welcomed Bucke to
                    England and praised Whitman. In a postscript to the letter, Bucke observed: "If
                    it were ever possible for you to come to England the fellows would go clean
                    crazy about you." Horace Traubel sent reports of the event to the Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Post</span> on August 1 and 14. Traubel's article "Over-Sea
                    Greeting. Walt Whitman's Fame Abroad" was published on the front page of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden Post</span> on August 1, 1891. The article includes an
                    account of Dr. John Johnston's visit to Whitman in the summer of 1890. Traubel
                    reprints letters from Johnston and James W. Wallace—co-founders of the
                    Bolton College of Whitman admireres—to Whitman and letters from Bucke to
                    Whitman that describe Bucke's own time in England in July and August 1891.
                    Traubel's article "Walt Whitman Abroad" was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Post</span> on August 7, and describes the conclusion of Bucke's visit to
                    Bolton. For Wallace's and Johnston's reactions to these pieces, see the letter

                    with money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a
