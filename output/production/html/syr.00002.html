                    three justices elected to the Wisconsin Supreme Court upon its creation in 1853.
                    Smith is perhaps most notable for his 1854 opinion in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ableman
                        v. Booth</span>, in which Smith wrote that the Fugitive Slave Act was
                    unconstitutional on the grounds of states' rights. Smith's ruling was overturned
                    by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1859, the same year Smith's tenure on the Wisconsin
                    Supreme Court ended. See also Ruth Dunley, "In Search of A. D. Smith: A History
