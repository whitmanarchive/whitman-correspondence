            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been perplexed how to express to you my feelings of gratitude for the gift of
                the letter which you wrote to our mutual friend, Wallace,<a href="#n6121" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6121">1</a> with
                instructions to give it to me "if I cared for it."<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> I do
                indeed care for it and shall always prize it for your sake. I am especially pleased
                to learn from it that you share my admiration for the noble stoic Epictetus,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> and I am quite with you in thinking that the Stoic
                teachings "are specially needed in a rich &amp; luxurious &amp; even scientific
                age." Worthy all admiration &amp; honor are those brave spirits who have withstood

                nature in the Stoic sense—in harmony with the highest reason, simple just,
                brave, free, cheerful &amp; beneficent &amp; magnanimous; and all honor to you dear
                friend whose example is so striking &amp; encouraging. Your philosophy &amp;
                practice approximate in many respects, as was pointed out by Wallace, to the Stoic
                ideal. You however superadd to their teachings the doctrine of immortality, which as
                a belief in the continuance of conscious identity hereafter, the Stoics or, at least
                Epictetus, do not seem to have professed. Whether this doctrine be an <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01474.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01474.003_large.jpg</span> addition to the
                truths they taught I have not yet been able to determine though I perceive from your
                works it has been of commanding importance in your life giving to it force buoyancy
                &amp; hope; and I look upon it as a circumstance of great weight that one who has
                had your unique experience of life &amp; death, &amp; who is so conversant with the
                latest teaching of science should be so profoundly convinced of its truth. This fact
                at any rate is sufficient to make one pause before coming to a negative
                conclusion.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have also to thank you, Mr Whitman, for inscribing my name in the copy of Leaves of

                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February
