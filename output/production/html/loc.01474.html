                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman,</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been perplexed how to express to you my feelings of gratitude for the gift of
                the letter which you wrote to our mutual friend, Wallace, with
                instructions to give it to me "if I cared for it." I do
                indeed care for it and shall always prize it for your sake. I am especially pleased
                to learn from it that you share my admiration for the noble stoic Epictetus, and I am quite with you in thinking that the Stoic
                teachings "are specially needed in a rich &amp; luxurious &amp; even scientific
                age." Worthy all admiration &amp; honor are those brave spirits who have withstood
                    <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01474.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the forces
                &amp; temptations of the age &amp; given us examples of lives lived according to
                nature in the Stoic sense—in harmony with the highest reason, simple just,
                brave, free, cheerful &amp; beneficent &amp; magnanimous; and all honor to you dear
                friend whose example is so striking &amp; encouraging. Your philosophy &amp;
                practice approximate in many respects, as was pointed out by Wallace, to the Stoic
                ideal. You however superadd to their teachings the doctrine of immortality, which as
                a belief in the continuance of conscious identity hereafter, the Stoics or, at least
                Epictetus, do not seem to have professed. Whether this doctrine be an <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01474.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> addition to the
                truths they taught I have not yet been able to determine though I perceive from your
                works it has been of commanding importance in your life giving to it force buoyancy
                &amp; hope; and I look upon it as a circumstance of great weight that one who has
                had your unique experience of life &amp; death, &amp; who is so conversant with the
                latest teaching of science should be so profoundly convinced of its truth. This fact
                at any rate is sufficient to make one pause before coming to a negative
                conclusion.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have also to thank you, Mr Whitman, for inscribing my name in the copy of Leaves of
                Grass which the "Boys of the College" gave to me on my birthday. It was a <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01474.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01474.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> thoughtful
                kindness both on your and their parts which I highly appreciate. The book has become
                almost the bible of the College &amp; a vade mecum in our country walks &amp;
                holidays adding light &amp; interest to almost every scene. I therefore need not say
                how pleased I was to possess a copy containing your and their autographs.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen your letter to Dr. Johnston about your birthday and
                also "Warry's"; both of them are full of deep interest. Many thanks for the kind
                messages to the boys (in which I always include myself) contained in them &amp; your
                numerous other letters which have all been read to us.—I am pleased to observe
                that your health was better after the "spree." May it long continue to improve &amp;
                may you enjoy many such sprees.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My loving sympathy to you in your painful infirmities and wishing you the best of
                good cheer, in which my wife joins</p>
            <span class="tei_closer"> 
                <span class="tei_salute">I am yours sincerely</span>
