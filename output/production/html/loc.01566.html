            <p class="tei_p">14 copies, as I understand from French &amp; Richardson, are due you, having
                already been paid for by you. The remaining 76 copies you can have at $1 (?)

                    first issue was printed by Chapin, and Walt Whitman considered asking Henry E.
                    Huntington Library and Son to distribute it; see Whitman's <a href="nyp.00210">August 26, 1866</a> letter to William D. O'Connor. One
                    of the later issues, to which <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> was added, was
                    bound by James Gray, who became bankrupt; see Whitman's <a href="duk.00649">October 13, 1867</a> letter to Dionysius Thomas. Evidently, Anderson and
                    Archer received and bound the sheets in Gray's possession. Dionysius Thomas and
                    Doolady, rather than Henry E. Huntington Library and Son, distributed the book.
