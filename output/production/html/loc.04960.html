            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your kind post-card of Sept. 30<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> 
                rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> on the 11<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst, and 
                the pocket-book copy of
                L. of G. received this morning. Many thanks.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to hear of the visit from John Burroughs, which I know
                would be a very great pleasure to you both. He told D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>
                    J. that he wished very much that he could persuade you to
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">live</span> near him.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Johnston tells me that a friend of ours, &amp; a
                school-fellow of mine,—Fred Wild—is likely to call upon you. He has been
                spending a little time in Canada, &amp; wrote home that he would return by New York, 
                &amp; would probably go on to Camden to see you. D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J. sent you
                a telegram to that effect last week. I understand, however, that he is likely to
                have left America before this reaches you.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02188.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02188.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02188.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I spent 3 days in Yorkshire last
                week—so ending my holiday.—I am by no means so much
                    recruited in health as I
                expected, but hope to improve gradually as time goes on.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The weather here is broken—two or three days of fair weather alternating with a
                few days of rain. Fairly warm so far, getting colder at nights.</p>

                1887. Probably you have not seen it, and I think I will enclose it. It is of very
                slight value but is interesting because of its source—the S. C. having a large
                circulation amongst the working classes here &amp; being very radical &amp; heterodox in
                character.—It pays you the left-handed compliment of professing to employ a
                "Walt Whitman Junior" on its staff, whose verses often appear but do no credit to
                the name!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Johnston seems in good health now &amp; very busy.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope that the "grippe" has now left you, &amp;, with love &amp; best wishes always,
                remain</p>
