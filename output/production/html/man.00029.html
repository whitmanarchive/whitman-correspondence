            <p class="tei_p">Has it seemed to you a long while since I wrote? It has to me, a very long while,
                &amp; many's the day that I have said to myself, to-morrow I shall write a long
                letter &amp; then the quiet leisure needed has never come. I sometimes think the
                best way would be to keep a letter always going—to jot down once a week, say,
                anything that I fancy will interest you &amp; then send you the sum total at a
                months end.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have news about dear Bee that will surprise and, perhaps, disappoint you. After she
                had studied four or five months at Bern the field of medical study began to broaden
                out before her: she realized <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00187_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00187_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00187_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> more than even before what science was being brought to bear on
                the investigation of disease, &amp; slowly, reluctantly, painfully she came to the
                conclusion that she had not sufficient grasp of intellect to master all that she saw
                a physician ought to master. She could get through her examinations well enough as
                she has done before—but could not she said "pass" her own inward examination
                or conscientiously enter upon practice—she would not add to the already too
                great number of "fumbling physicians". <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00188_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00188_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00188_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>I thought perhaps she was suffering
                from such work &amp; took a morbid view of things, &amp; wrote to her to come home at
                once for a rest at any rate. So she is now with us, &amp; I said we would not speak
                of it to any one till she was rested, &amp; we had talked it well over. For I fully
                believe myself, that though not brilliantly gifted, her intellect is fully up to the
                average &amp; a
                character a good deal beyond—that her devotedness &amp; sympathy would in the
                end after long years of careful study make her an admirable physician. But I find
                her conviction is so strong &amp; so conscientious, so against <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00053_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00053_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00053_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>her own wishes—for she loves
                both the studies &amp; the practice better than ever &amp; is bitterly disappointed,—
                that no more was to be said. And as regards my own feelings (though I am sorry for
                her sorrow, &amp; sorry too that the excellent work I think she would do should go
                undone) yet the profession was like a great man that swallowed her up from me. I had
                seen nothing of her for two years &amp; should not for three or four more, &amp; I
                    shrank from the
                arduousness of the life for her. And I have no doubt but that she will find scope <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00054_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00054_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00054_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>in other ways for
                her fine
                qualities. So I am well content—&amp; it is such a comfort &amp; delight to
                have her at home with us once more. And the training she has is a splendid
                preparation for life generally.—Herby has been working double tides to finish
                a picture he is going to send into the Academy on Tuesday; but whether it will get
                hung or no is always a toss up for young artists. One of our Philadelphia friends
                M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span>. Murry Gibson has been over here &amp; gives Herby
                a small commission too. William Rossetti spent good Friday afternoon with us; was
                very pleased with Herby's work. And then we had a long jolly talk about you dear
                Friend—you have no truer <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00189_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00189_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00189_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>appreciator &amp; friend than he I find he stands fast. Indeed
                your friends &amp; lovers in England are none of them half hearted,—but then
                perhaps it is not possible to be so toward you. We find Hampstead so pleasant &amp;
                healthful that we are looking out for a house to settle down in—and then dear
                friend if only you will come! it is not so formidable a journey as to Colorado. I
                wonder if you have been lecturing or writing about that.</p>
