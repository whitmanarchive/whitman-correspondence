                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    text of his letter, Whitman must have referred in this note to the book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New Spirit</span> (London: George Bell and Sons, 1890) by
                    Havelock Ellis (1859–1939), a physician and pioneer in the study of human
                    sexuality. Ellis devoted a chapter of the book to Whitman. Kennedy concluded his
                    letter: "Love unlimited fr. yr constant lover &amp; friend. | W.S.K." Whitman
                    also mentioned the book in his <a href="loc.08001">February 16, 1891</a>,
                    letter to the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
