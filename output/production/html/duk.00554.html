            <p class="tei_p">i
                received your letter
            yesterday it is the first i believe that
            i have got on tuesday but i am very
            thankfull to get them wensday i
            should have written immediately
            and told you the letter and 2 dollr
                came safe but i was fixing georges
            things a little as he has gone to camden
            to the foundry 
                    
                he and mr Lane went
            last night in the 6 oclock train
            georgy dident want to go much i dont
            think it was on my account but
            georgy is very much carried away
            by somebody who it is is best known
            to himself
            he gets 5 dollar per day
            and his expences paid to the city
            once a month if he comes oftener
            he pays his own way he said he should
            come 2 weeks from next saturday
            i think sometimes its a pity such a good
            man as george would be) he is good
            to me but he seems to be so close with
            his moneey maybee he has uses for
            it that i little know he pays the rent
            and when i ask him for ten cts he
            gives it to me but he used to be
            so different well walt we all
            change some for better and some
            for worse</p>
