            to me but he seems to be so close with
            his moneey maybee he has uses for
            it that i little know he pays the rent
            and when i ask him for ten cts he
            gives it to me but he used to be
            so different well walt we all

    <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00554_n1 note" id="duk.00554_n1"><span><p class="tei_p">The date of this letter
                        is uncertain, but clues point to a date of November 4, 1868. Richard Maurice
                        Bucke assigned the date November 11, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller
                        accepted Bucke's date (see Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                        1961–77], 2:366). But the letter is likely to date to the Wednesday a
                        week earlier, November 4, 1868. Another letter from Louisa Van Velsor
                        Whitman to Walt, which described Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's recent
                        throat surgery, is more likely to date <a href="duk.00553">November 11,
                            1868</a>, and that letter fulfills this letter's concluding promise to
                        "write about domestic affairs." Second, this letter does not mention
                        Mattie's throat surgery or her recovery from that surgery. Presumably, then,
                        the throat surgery was still in the future at the time of this letter.
                        Louisa wrote bluntly in this letter that "i have not got any hous yet." In
                        her next week's letter (November 11), she wrote that son George Washington
                        Whitman "has got a draw of the two houses they talk of building," which
                        implies that Louisa believed that one of the two houses that George planned
                        to build will be for her and her son Edward Whitman.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This letter has no mention of Charley Mann or his illness, a topic that
                        dominates Louisa's <a href="duk.00552">November 10, 1868</a> letter.
                        Finally, this letter says that George went to Camden "last night" and is
                        expected to stay there until "2 weeks from next Saturday" (November 21 if
                        this letter dates to November 4). In the November 10 letter, she wrote that
                        George "is away," but he has returned to Brooklyn by Louisa's <a href="duk.00555">November 18, 1868</a> letter. That George remained
                        away in Camden for two full weeks is unlikely because Louisa wrote in this
                        letter that he "is very much carried away by somebody," presumably Louisa
                        Orr Haslam, his future wife. Because a number of contextual clues point to
                        this letter's date as a Tuesday approximately a week before Louisa's
                        November 11, 1868 letter to Walt—and though no one clue is
                        decisive—this letter dates November to 4, 1868.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    a romantic interest. She likewise described a companion of Joseph Phineas Davis,
                    who is "here quite often to supper and stay all night," as a "mr somebody" (see

                        (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," had arrived in Brooklyn from St. Louis
                        for medical treatment and a holiday visit in mid-October. Thomas Jefferson
                        "Jeff" Whitman joined his wife and children near the end of November, and
                        they returned to St. Louis in mid-December. It is possible that Mattie
                        departed from Brooklyn for a brief period in mid- or late-November 1868 (see
                        Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00553">November 11, 1868</a>

                    <p class="tei_p">Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In early
                        1868, Mattie and her daughters moved from Brooklyn to St. Louis to join
                        Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent
                        of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
                        death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,

                    Whitman's early November 1868 letter to Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman is not
                    extant, but he remained in St. Louis. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890)
                    was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt
                    Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he worked as a surveyor and
                    topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working for the Brooklyn Water
                    Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became
                    Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a nationally recognized
                    name in civil engineering.
