            <p class="tei_p">A most savage feeling is beginning to pervade the
                public mind in New-York, towards the infernal class of villains who commit the
                incendiarisms which for the past three months have been laying waste so much
                property, as well as human hope and comfort, here and in Brooklyn. The destruction
                of Murphy's large stables last Sunday morning, contributes to intensify this wrath.
                Woe be to the first of these incendiaries who shall be caught! I should not be much
                surprised if a dash of Lynch law were to come in play, then, unless the police
                muster strong.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">You will notice by the papers that Van Buren runs considerably ahead
                of Cass, in this State. The Free Soilers say that large numbers of their men voted
                for Taylor, with the determination of defeating Cass at any rate. Probably this is
                so; but then some of the dissatisfied Whigs voted for Van Buren. All that the
                Michiganian received in this State is attributable to the strong attachment of the
                Democrats to "regular nominations." But here I am babbling of politics—without any
                need.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The other night, Mr. Fillmore, the Vice President elect, (you know he was
                defeated in '44, when he ran against Silas Wright, for Governor,) had a
                complimentary dinner given him at the Irving House. Many celebrities and jovial
                folks were there. But Fillmore isn't over-popular even among the Whigs. He is
                generally understood as belonging to the Courier and Express side, in opposition to
                the Tribune side. O, Lord, how those "sides" do hate each other!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Much learned debate
                is held in certain quarters, especially among the medical and municipal
                functionaries, about the probable approach of the Cholera. It seems to be the
                general opinion that we have got to take it. If so, the sooner it comes, the better.
                It is queer to see the antics "some people" cut up, at the mention of the cholera.
                Consumption, dysentery, and inflammatory attacks all around us, are ten times worse
                than the cholera, but you can't make the people think so. Isn't there something in
                "a name?" Something? Why, the whole civilized world is governed by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">names</span>.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">About 11
                o'clock this morning, your humble servant went to take a stroll in Broadway. Never
                did the gay thoroughfare look more lovely! Never did the sun shine more gladsomely,
                or the air feel balmier, or the women look sweeter! True, there was a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">little</span> mud—and
                if one didn't take good care, he received awkward splashes of the same; but "what
                can't be cured, must be endured," and mud in New York must be endured, most
                emphatically. (This is a kind of "Free Soil" doctrine, however, that all people
                won't agree with.)</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">On the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">other</span> corner of Rector street, (Trinity Church, you know,
                fills the upper side,) they are putting up a large brick and marble structure, whose
                depth and recesses, as you stand in Broadway and look at them, make one think of
                those endless perspective halls that the "flats" on the stage sometimes represent.
                The walls of Grace Church—delightful, musical Grace, where Malibran used to sing in
                the choir, and which always was celebrated for its singing—the old walls that stood
                threateningly for two years, have been pushed and pulled down;—and here goes up this
                flaunting, measureless hall. What it's for, nobody yet knows.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">New York is unusually
                full of stray visiters. A score or two of miscellaneous thousands make no great
                difference, of course; but a few hundreds, who dress well—only a little different
                from "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the</span> touch"—and who go about seeing sights, form an item that people are not
                sorry to behold. They add to trade, for one thing; and do the office of "lookers on
                in"—New York. What good were all the fine things of the metropolis, if people didn't
                come and admire them?</p>
