            <p class="tei_p">A most savage feeling is beginning to pervade the
                public mind in New-York, towards the infernal class of villains who commit the
                incendiarisms which for the past three months have been laying waste so much
                property, as well as human hope and comfort, here and in Brooklyn. The destruction
                of Murphy's large stables<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">1</a> last Sunday morning, contributes to intensify this wrath.
                Woe be to the first of these incendiaries who shall be caught! I should not be much
                surprised if a dash of Lynch law were to come in play, then, unless the police
                muster strong.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">You will notice by the papers that Van Buren<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">2</a> runs considerably ahead
                of Cass,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> in this State. The Free Soilers<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">4</a> say that large numbers of their men voted
                for Taylor,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">5</a> with the determination of defeating Cass at any rate. Probably this is
                so; but then some of the dissatisfied Whigs<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> voted for Van Buren. All that the
                Michiganian received in this State is attributable to the strong attachment of the
                Democrats to "regular nominations." But here I am babbling of politics—without any
                need.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The other night, Mr. Fillmore,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> the Vice President elect, (you know he was
                defeated in '44, when he ran against Silas Wright,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">8</a> for Governor,) had a
                complimentary dinner given him at the Irving House. Many celebrities and jovial
                folks were there. But Fillmore isn't over-popular even among the Whigs. He is
                generally understood as belonging to the Courier and Express side, in opposition to
                the Tribune side. O, Lord, how those "sides" do hate each other!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Much learned debate
                is held in certain quarters, especially among the medical and municipal
                functionaries, about the probable approach of the Cholera.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">9</a> It seems to be the
                general opinion that we have got to take it. If so, the sooner it comes, the better.
                It is queer to see the antics "some people" cut up, at the mention of the cholera.
                Consumption,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">10</a> dysentery,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">11</a> and inflammatory attacks all around us, are ten times worse
                than the cholera, but you can't make the people think so. Isn't there something in
                "a name?" Something? Why, the whole civilized world is governed by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">names</span>.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">About 11
                o'clock this morning, your humble servant went to take a stroll in Broadway. Never
                did the gay thoroughfare look more lovely! Never did the sun shine more gladsomely,
                or the air feel balmier, or the women look sweeter! True, there was a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">little</span> mud—and
                if one didn't take good care, he received awkward splashes of the same; but "what
                can't be cured, must be endured," and mud in New York must be endured, most
                emphatically. (This is a kind of "Free Soil" doctrine, however, that all people
                won't agree with.)</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">On the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">other</span> corner of Rector street, (Trinity Church,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">12</a> you know,
                fills the upper side,) they are putting up a large brick and marble structure, whose
                depth and recesses, as you stand in Broadway and look at them, make one think of
                those endless perspective halls that the "flats" on the stage sometimes represent.
                The walls of Grace Church—delightful, musical Grace, where Malibran<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">13</a> used to sing in
                the choir, and which always was celebrated for its singing—the old walls that stood
                threateningly for two years, have been pushed and pulled down;—and here goes up this
                flaunting, measureless hall. What it's for, nobody yet knows.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">New York is unusually
                full of stray visiters. A score or two of miscellaneous thousands make no great
                difference, of course; but a few hundreds, who dress well—only a little different
                from "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the</span> touch"—and who go about seeing sights, form an item that people are not
                sorry to behold. They add to trade, for one thing; and do the office of "lookers on
                in"—New York. What good were all the fine things of the metropolis, if people didn't
                come and admire them?</p>

                defeated the incumbent Van Buren in the 1840 election to become the ninth
                president of the United States. Van Buren later became an anti-slavery leader and 
                was the Free Soil candidate for president in the 1848 election; the Whig Candidate Zachary Taylor

                    military officer. He served as a Senator representing the state of Michigan, as the Secretary of War under President Andrew Jackson, 
                    and as Secretary of State under James Buchanan. In 1848 he was the Democratic candidate for president. Cass was a 
                    proponent of the Doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, which held that each territory should choose whether to 
                    permit slavery. Cass was also crucial in the implementation of Andrew Jackson's policy of Indian Removal. For

                    Party opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories of the western United States,
                 which included the territory that Mexico had ceded to the United States
                 in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War. When neither the 
                 Democratic nor the Republican party presidential nominees would rule out the expansion of slavery
                 into these territories, the Free Soil Party was formed in response. The Free Soil

                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
