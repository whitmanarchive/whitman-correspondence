                    (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
                    for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
                    December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
                    Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
                    some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
                    Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
                    (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22, 1870</a> letter to Walt).

                    Walt Whitman, the Brown family rented the "lower part" of the house at $14
                    per month. John Brown, a tailor, and his family remained in the house for five
                    years, but the relationship between the Browns and Jeff Whitman's family was
                    often strained. Louisa's reference to John Brown as an "uncommon name" evokes
                    the noted abolitionist, who was executed six months before this letter was
                    written. The famous abolitionist John Brown (1800–1859) began pursuing a
                    violent guerilla war against slavery in Kansas and Missouri in 1856. In October
                    1859, Brown stormed a federal armory at Harper's Ferry but was captured by
                    marines under the command of Robert E. Lee. Brown's execution ten days later
                    transformed him into a martyr for the abolitionist cause (see Robert McGlone,
