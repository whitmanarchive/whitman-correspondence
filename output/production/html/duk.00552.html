                        November 10, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1868. Edwin
                        Haviland Miller also dated the letter November 10, 1868 (see Walt Whitman,
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University
                        Press, 1961–77], 2:366). Bucke's and Miller's date is correct. The
                        year is consistent both with the death of Charley Mann, whose illness is
                        mentioned in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00550">November 2
                            or 3?, 1868</a> letter to Walt, and with the year (but not the month)
                        in which Louisa's daughter Hannah Heyde's thumb was amputated.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The letter is difficult to reconcile with Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's
                        late-1868 visit to Brooklyn and with Hannah's surgery. Louisa acknowledged
                        two recent letters from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Mattie, letters
                        that were prompted, Louisa said, by a letter from Walt that "stirred them
                        up." That both Mattie and Jeff would write to Louisa in early November 1868
                        is quizzical because Mattie began an extended visit to Brooklyn for medical
                        treatment in mid-October 1868 (see Walt's <a href="mhs.00027">October
                            25, 1868</a> letter to Jeff). Furthermore, it has been assumed that
                        Mattie, who came to Brooklyn in part for medical treatment, remained in
                        Brooklyn from her mid-October arrival until her return to St. Louis with
                        Jeff in mid-December. Walt's letter implies the same when he described
                        Mattie as "comfortably situated" (Miller <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span>, 2:68, n. 21; Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New
                        York: New York University Press, 1977], 60). But Mattie was unlikely to have
                        remained with Louisa from mid-October to mid-December. Mattie in early
                        November 1868 presumably returned to St. Louis (or visited elsewhere), which
                        would explain why Walt's forwarded letter from Louisa could prompt a "letter
                        from jeff and one from matty." Louisa's reference to Hannah's "losing her
                        thumb" presents another complication for dating the letter. If the month and
                        year, November 1868, are correct, Louisa cannot refer to the surgical
                        amputation of Hannah's thumb (in December 1868) but rather to its loss of
                        use.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The letter cannot date earlier than the election of 1868, when Charley Mann
                        was noted ill but alive, nor can it date to the following year, by which
                        time Louisa had moved to Portland Avenue.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite
                    brother. In early adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer.
                    In the 1850s he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained
                    employed through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water

                    pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">13. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00425_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
                    George, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
