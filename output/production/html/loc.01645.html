            <p class="tei_p">—I have just had my dinner—roast beef, lima beans, graham-bread &amp; sweet butter, 
                with a cup of tea, &amp; some stewed cranberries—eat quite a good dinner, &amp; enjoyed it all. 
                I still consider myself getting along very well. O if <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this</span> only holds out, &amp; keeps on favorably, 
                even if ever so moderate &amp; slow—But I seem to have so many of these gleams that delude me 
                into thinking I am on the way to recovery, but soon cloud over again, &amp; let me back as bad as ever—But every time I feel pretty easy, I still keep thinking, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">now</span> 
                I am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">certainly</span> going to get much better <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this time</span>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete your short letter came to-day, written on the cars—dear son, come whenever you can—As I said on my postal card, if you were here this week, you would find me more like myself, 
                (with the exception of walking) than I have been for fourteen months—whether it will continue 
                or not, God only knows—but we will hope for the best. As I sit here writing to you to day, 
                it appears to me every way hopeful, &amp; likely that we shall yet have good times. 
                Every thing is quiet—rather lonesome. My little dog is stretched out on the rug 
                at full length, snoozing. He hardly lets me go a step without being close at my heels—follows me in my slow walks, &amp; stops or turns just as I do. We have had a most windy blustering 
                March, but it is pleasanter &amp; milder yesterday &amp; to-day—(I saw the new moon over my right 
                shoulder a week ago,—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">of course</span> a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sure</span> sign 
                of good luck)—Will finish the letter &amp; send it to-morrow.
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pleasant &amp; bright weather—have been out on the side walk in front, once or twice, 
                with my shawl around me—walk slow &amp; quite feeble—have some spells of bad head-ache—Went by the West Philadelphia depot yesterday afternoon, in the Market st. horse-cars—saw plenty of RR men &amp; conductors, about the place, lounging &amp; waiting their time—thought if I could only see <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> among them—As I sit here writing I can see the trains 
                of the Camden &amp; Amboy, in full view, some 40 or 50 rods off—makes it quite lively—As I write I am feeling pretty comfortable, &amp; am going out awhile after I finish this—but had a bad night last night. Hope this will find you all right—good bye for this time, dear son.</p>
