                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February
