        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter to-day, and I also rec'd your letter of Tuesday, (as I wrote Wednesday)—I will write a few lines to
          Lillie, (mostly for Aunt Sally Mead)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I got a good letter from Jeff yesterday—Mother, Jeff is
        evidently feeling composed &amp; well—of course he feels Matty's death very seriously,
        but I think he has recovered from the shock, and attends to his business as well as
        ever—They seem to be well situated at the Buckley's—Jeff writes quite a good
        deal about you—he writes about Mat's death—about her wishing to see us before
        she died—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this seated at my desk in the office—I come over to the office about
        12—I do not feel very well, most of the time, but have spells when I feel much better,
        generally evening—I think the sun affects me—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, we—I and the doctor—have talked much of the electric battery
          treatment—but as long as the head is affected, (the
        brain &amp; nerves) they say it must not be applied, for it will do more harm than good,
        might cause convulsions—My doctor, Dr. Drinkard, says he will use it as soon as he
        feels it will do good—but the time has not come yet—I believe I told you I am
        taking iron, strychnia &amp; quinine to give strength—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote to Jeff yesterday—I send you Harper's Weekly, to-day, mother, it is quite interesting—I still hold my mind about getting a house
        here &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">shall certainly do so</span>—At
        present my great hope is to get well, to get so I can walk, &amp; have some use of my
        limbs—I can write, pretty well, and my mind is clear, but I cannot walk a block, &amp;
        have no power to do any thing, in lifting or moving any thing in my room, or at my
        desk—Still I keep good spirits, better far than I would have supposed myself, knowing
        that I shall get all right in time—I know <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">how much worse</span> things
        might be in my situation than they are, &amp; feel thankful enough that they are as well as
        they are—Mother, I was glad to get your letter of Tuesday, April 1. I have been
        reading the wreck of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span> April 1st—I think it the saddest thing I ever read—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, mama dear, I will close—I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—Love to
        you, dear mother, &amp; to all—it is now about ½ past 1 Friday afternoon—I
        wrote to you Wednesday 2d April, which I suppose you got. </p>
