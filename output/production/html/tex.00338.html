      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter to-day, and I also rec'd your letter of Tuesday, (as I wrote Wednesday)—I will write a few lines to
          Lillie,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> (mostly for Aunt Sally Mead)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I got a good letter from Jeff<a href="#n0710" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0710">4</a> yesterday<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a>—Mother, Jeff is
        evidently feeling composed &amp; well—of course he feels Matty's<a href="#n0707" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0707">6</a> death very seriously,
        but I think he has recovered from the shock, and attends to his business as well as
        ever—They seem to be well situated at the Buckley's—Jeff writes quite a good
        deal about you—he writes about Mat's death—about her wishing to see us before
        she died—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this seated at my desk in the office—I come over to the office about
        12—I do not feel very well, most of the time, but have spells when I feel much better,
        generally evening—I think the sun affects me—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, we—I and the doctor—have talked much of the electric battery
          treatment<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a>—but as long as the head is affected, (the
        brain &amp; nerves) they say it must not be applied, for it will do more harm than good,
        might cause convulsions—My doctor, Dr. Drinkard, says he will use it as soon as he
        feels it will do good—but the time has not come yet—I believe I told you I am
        taking iron, strychnia &amp; quinine to give strength—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote to Jeff yesterday—I send you Harper's Weekly<a href="#n0290" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0290">8</a>, to-day, mother, it is quite interesting—I still hold my mind about getting a house
        here &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">shall certainly do so</span><a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">9</a>—At
        present my great hope is to get well, to get so I can walk, &amp; have some use of my
        limbs—I can write, pretty well, and my mind is clear, but I cannot walk a block, &amp;
        have no power to do any thing, in lifting or moving any thing in my room, or at my
        desk—Still I keep good spirits, better far than I would have supposed myself, knowing
        that I shall get all right in time—I know <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">how much worse</span> things
        might be in my situation than they are, &amp; feel thankful enough that they are as well as
        they are—Mother, I was glad to get your letter of Tuesday, April 1. I have been
        reading the wreck of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span> April 1st<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">10</a>—I think it the saddest thing I ever read—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, mama dear, I will close—I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—Love to
        you, dear mother, &amp; to all—it is now about ½ past 1 Friday afternoon—I
        wrote to you Wednesday 2d April, which I suppose you got. </p>

                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"

                    daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
                    the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
