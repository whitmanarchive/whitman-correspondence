                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    published in 1865. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln occurred while <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> was being printed, and Whitman promptly added
                    the short poem "Hush'd be the Camps To-day," with a note about Lincoln's death
                    to the final signature of the book. Whitman then decided to stop the printing
                    and add a sequel to the book that would more fully take into account Lincoln's
                    death. Copies of the volume were withdrawn so that the sequel could be added.
                    Whitman hastily composed several poems, adding eighteen new poems to those that
                    appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, and all of these poems were
                    published in a second edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to Drum-Taps</span>
                    (1865–1866). Later, these poems were folded into <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves
                        of Grass</span>, and by the time the final arrangement of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was printed in 1881, the "Drum-Taps" cluster that
                    Whitman included in that volume contained forty-three poems. For more
