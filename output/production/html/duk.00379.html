               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Jimmy is getting along favorably as usual but of course somewhat slowly. I was with him night before last, &amp; am going again this afternoon. It requires a good deal of patience in him to lay so steadily confined in bed, but he still has the good luck to continue remarkably free from any acute suffering. Night before last he had some pain &amp; swelling in the foot &amp; leg below the wound, but nothing of serious account. They bandaged it pretty tightly, &amp; that seemed to relieve it. Jim wished me to write to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> this time, &amp; I promised him night before last to do so. I wrote at that time from the hospital to your parents at Comac, &amp; sent the letter yesterday. Jim is dissatisfied unless I write pretty often, whether there is any thing to write about or not—My friend, I rec'd your note about your folks getting your dear brother's body from down in Virginia. Dear friend, the rebels have lately advanced upon us, as you doubtless know, &amp; held Culpepper &amp; thereabout for many days past—but the rumor now is that they are falling back, &amp; that Meade will probably take possession of his old ground—but at present I doubt if any thing could be done—the authorities here do not grant passes yet, they are stricter than ever—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear friends all, I would say to you as I have written to Jimmy's parents, that I shall try to keep watch of the boy, as I shall probably continue in Washington for some time yet—&amp; if any thing should occur I will write to you—as it may be some reliance to you &amp; make you feel less uneasy, to feel that Jim can have nothing occur in his case without your being informed—though as far as now appears, he will go on favorably, &amp; his wound is likely to heal so that he can sit up, &amp; then gradually move about, &amp; so in due time be able to travel—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">So, my friend, farewell for present, &amp; I pray that God may be with you, &amp; though we are strangers I send my love to you &amp; all Jimmy's sisters &amp; brothers in law—for in times of trouble &amp; death folks draw near in spirit regardless of being separated by distance, or of being personally strangers—</p>
