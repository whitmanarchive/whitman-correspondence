                    Lowell wrote to James T. Fields: "I enclose . . . three [poems] from Walt
                    Whitman. '1861' he says is $20. the others $8. each"; see M. A. De Wolfe
                    Howe, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Letters of James Russell Lowell</span> (New York:
                    Harper, 1932), 102. On October 10, 1861, the editors of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> declined "the three poems with which you have favored
                    us, but which we could not possibly use before their interest,—which is of
                    the present,—would have passed" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [1906-1996], 9
                    vols., 2:213). When Horace Traubel asked Whitman in 1888 for the titles of these
                    poems, he replied: "I don't just remember: I do remember that the idea that
                    their interest was of the present struck me as being a bit odd: I always have
                    written with something more than a simply contemporary perspective" (2:213).
                    "1861" appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> (1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
