            <p class="tei_p">If we are going into this thing my notion is to do it as thoroughly as consistent
                &amp; tempered by publishing a monthly mag: for popular reading. My suggestion w'd
                be (if you feel to give space enough) to print after that "personal memoranda" of
                mine, the three pieces as follows:</p>
            <span class="tei_floatingText">
            
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">the Quaker bit</li><li class="tei_item">the piece ab't L of G. in science</li><li class="tei_item">&amp; then
           Traubel's piece, (pretty high handed &amp; eulogistic as it
                is)</li></ul>
            
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">each of these three pieces signed by its author's name (now that O'Connor and Mrs: Gilchrist are dead those three
                are perhaps my best representative adherents, illustrators &amp; longest knowers,
                personal &amp; literary)—H T has been &amp; is faithful &amp; invaluable to
                me—I have cull'd out some parts of his MS too eulogistic &amp; transcendental
                &amp; if you note any more, do so further—I have been clear to supervise all
                this matter not only f'm the self-description &amp; self-love points, but also of
                the point of view of an article for a monthly mag: for miscellaneous readers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">H T's MS will probably come to you forthwith—Let me see good proofs in good
                time.</p>
