            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd the letters this afternoon, two in the envelope with a note from you. I wrote to William some five days ago—has he not rec'd it? I had grown worse, quite a good deal, &amp; I was about making up my mind that I would have to stand a good seige—but yesterday the current changed, &amp; I felt better all day, &amp; in the afternoon went out riding with my brother, the first time I have been out of the house since I got home—&amp; to-day I remain feeling better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The doctor to-day tells me my throat is markedly better—In my letter to William I told him I had rec'd his—I have also rec'd one from Nelly—it was very welcome, &amp; I shall try to answer it soon—When you write tell me the impressions you got in the army, &amp; the probabilities as far as you can make them out—As to me, I still believe in Grant, &amp; that we shall get Richmond—we have heard from my brother to July 2—tell me about Ashton—in a day or two as I get strength I shall probably go down the island—</p>
