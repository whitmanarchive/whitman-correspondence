            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new with me the last two weeks—how has it been with you?—Are you
                on the C &amp; A again—&amp; how about that
                Medford Station?—Write soon—(it will do you good to write &amp; fully &amp;
                carefully—I wish you would oftener)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have had something of a set-back—A rascally publisher in New York named
                Worthington has been printing and selling a cheaper edition of my book for his own
                profit, no benefit to me at all—&amp; it has been going on privately for a
                year—I only found it out for certain about ten days ago—of course it is
                quite a hurt to me—will lead to a law suit, as I shall have to sue him, &amp;
                I hate getting into law—it is almost as bad to me to sue, as to be
                sued—then it cost money—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I am jogging along here about the same—keep<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00238_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00238_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00238_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> pretty well, &amp; eat my allowance
                every time—went over to 41st st: <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​  to eat my Thanksgiving dinner, with an old friend of mine, (his wife
                &amp; two young ones)—had a good time—Came back home in a rousing snow
                storm, but got along all right—Sunday morning went to breakfast at Mr and Mrs
                    Scovel's—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I am sitting up here 3d story—warm &amp; nice, every thing as still as can
                be—it has struck 8, and the wind outside moans &amp; whistles by
                starts—have been reading the evening paper, &amp; to-day's <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​ 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span>—&amp; I thought I would write to you, but I am

      </span></span> made out a very interesting letter—It was well I was down there the
                good weather middle of November—it has been bad enough since, some bitter
                cold—I have got my new overcoat, it is thick &amp; warm &amp; I like
                it—have you got the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">new cider</span>?—Love to your father
                &amp; mother, not forgetting your share dear son—</p>
