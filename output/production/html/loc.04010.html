                Worthington has been printing and selling a cheaper edition of my book for his own
                profit, no benefit to me at all—&amp; it has been going on privately for a
                year—I only found it out for certain about ten days ago—of course it is
                quite a hurt to me—will lead to a law suit, as I shall have to sue him, &amp;
                I hate getting into law—it is almost as bad to me to sue, as to be
