            <p class="tei_p">I hope you will not consider this letter from an utter stranger a liberty. Indeed, I
                hardly feel a stranger to you, nor is this the first letter that I have written to
                you. My friend Edward Dowden has told me often that you like
                new acquaintances or I should rather say friends. And as an old friend I send you an inclosure

                interest you. Four years ago I wrote the enclosed draft of a letter which I intended
                to copy out and send to you—it has lain in my desk since then—when I had
                heard that you were addressed as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Mr.</span> Whitman. It speaks
                for itself and needs no comment. It is as truly what I wanted to say as that light
                is light. The four years which have elapsed have made me love your work four fold
                and I can truly say that I have ever spoken as your friend. You know what <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00193_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00193_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00193_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> hostile criticism
                your work sometimes evokes here, and I wage a perpetual war with many friends on
                your behalf. But I am glad to say that I have been the means of making your work
                known to many who were scoffers at first. The years which have passed have not been
                uneventful to me, and I have felt and thought and suffered much in them, and I can
                truly say that from you I have had much pleasure and much consolation—and <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00194_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00194_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00194_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I do believe that
                your open earnest speech has not been thrown away on me or that my life &amp; thoughts
                fail to be marked with its impress—I write thus openly because I feel that with you one
                must be open. We have just had tonight a hot debate on your genius at the
                Fortnightly Club in which I had the privilege of putting
                forward my views—I think with success. Do not think me "cheeky" for writing
                thus. I only hope we may sometime meet &amp; I shall be able perhaps to say what I
                cannot write. Dowden promised to get me a copy of your new edition—and
                I hope that for any other work which you may have you will let me always be an early subscriber.
                I am sorry that you are not strong. Many of us were hoping to see you in Ireland.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had arranged to have a meeting for you—I do not know if you like getting letters.
                If you do I shall only be too happy to send you news of how thought goes among the
                men I know—</p>
