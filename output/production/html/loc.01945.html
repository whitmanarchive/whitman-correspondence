                hardly feel a stranger to you, nor is this the first letter that I have written to
                you. My friend Edward Dowden<a href="#n0199" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0199">1</a> has told me often that you like
                new acquaintances or I should rather say friends. And as an old friend I send you an inclosure

                for itself and needs no comment. It is as truly what I wanted to say as that light
                is light. The four years which have elapsed have made me love your work four fold
                and I can truly say that I have ever spoken as your friend.

                known to many who were scoffers at first. The years which have passed have not been
                uneventful to me, and I have felt and thought and suffered much in them, and I can

                your open earnest speech has not been thrown away on me or that my life &amp; thoughts
                fail to be marked with its impress—I write thus openly because I feel that with you one
                must be open. We have just had tonight a hot debate on your genius at the
                Fortnightly Club<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">3</a> in which I had the privilege of putting
                forward my views—I think with success. Do not think me "cheeky" for writing
                thus. I only hope we may sometime meet &amp; I shall be able perhaps to say what I
                cannot write. Dowden promised to get me a copy of your new edition<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">4</a>—and
                I hope that for any other work which you may have you will let me always be an early subscriber.
                I am sorry that you are not strong. Many of us were hoping to see you in Ireland.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had arranged to have a meeting for you—I do not know if you like getting letters.
                If you do I shall only be too happy to send you news of how thought goes among the

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
