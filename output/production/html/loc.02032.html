                earlier pieces were a little Foreign to the English idiom. I know nothing about him
                but I suspect he is a German from certain peculiarities of style &amp; I guess I am
                right about that—I am glad you have got so good and true a friend; and that
                other new friends have taken the places made vacant by death and
                absence.—Alas! Alas! "the old familiar faces." How fast they are fading away
                on this side of the river. Soon there will be more over there than here to greet us
                on that shining shore.—But enough of this pensive strain—</p>

                Boston at the age of 77.—one of the principal objects of my visit is of course
                to see her once more. I shall probably stay in San Francisco for a year or two
                longer in the internal revenue service—I am happily married to a loving and
                devoted wife. We keep house in a cosy flat near Golden Gate Park where we have
                plenty of fresh ocean breezes, laden morning and evening with the fragrance of
                grass, trees and flowers.—I was surprised and saddened some time ago to read

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
