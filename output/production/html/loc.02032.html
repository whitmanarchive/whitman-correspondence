            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have just read an article in New England Magazine posting your friends up to date
                in regard to your condition &amp;c and was much pleased with it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It seems to me the best thing I have seen from Traubels pen. His
                earlier pieces were a little Foreign to the English idiom. I know nothing about him
                but I suspect he is a German from certain peculiarities of style &amp; I guess I am
                right about that—I am glad you have got so good and true a friend; and that
                other new friends have taken the places made vacant by death and
                absence.—Alas! Alas! "the old familiar faces." How fast they are fading away
                on this side of the river. Soon there will be more over there than here to greet us
                on that shining shore.—But enough of this pensive strain—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was prompted to write particularly because next <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02032.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02032.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02032.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Sunday is your birthday—72
                years old. I send lots of love and all good wishes—I hope to see you sometime
                next month—I expect to come East on a short visit, and will spend a day with
                you on my way from Washington to Boston. Deo Volente.
                Probably the last of June or first of July.—My dear mother is yet living in
                Boston at the age of 77.—one of the principal objects of my visit is of course
                to see her once more. I shall probably stay in San Francisco for a year or two
                longer in the internal revenue service—I am happily married to a loving and
                devoted wife. We keep house in a cosy flat near Golden Gate Park where we have
                plenty of fresh ocean breezes, laden morning and evening with the fragrance of
                grass, trees and flowers.—I was surprised and saddened some time ago to read
                of the death of your brother Jeff.—I have very pleasant
                memories of him.—I get a Boston transcript from you occasionally. For which much thanks—I
                subscribe for the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Saturday Evn'g</span> Transcript so you need
                not send <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> number, but you seldom do so—God bless
                you my dear friend and may the physical burdens which <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02032.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02032.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02032.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> have weighed on you so heavily the
