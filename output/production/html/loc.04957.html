                    and publisher until his death in 1919. Traubel conceived of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Conservator</span> as a liberal periodical influenced by Whitman's poetic
                    and political ethos. A fair portion of its contents were devoted to Whitman
                    appreciation and the conservation of the poet's literary and personal
                    reputation. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">11. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07894_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07894_n2"><span>Whitman's book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> (1891) was his last miscellany, and it

                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as
