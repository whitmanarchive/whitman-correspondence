                you have used my "How I made a Book"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> &amp;c for the newspaper syndicate—All right. What I am somewhat concerned ab't is
                that I have not seen the proof (which is always an important point with
                me)—&amp; my 100 slips—What I mainly write now for, is to say, if
                possible, to have the slips run off from your type if still standing, &amp; sent me
                here—Thanks for the prompt pay— </p>
