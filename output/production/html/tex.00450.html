            <p class="tei_p">By an announcement in the Phil: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> this morning I suppose
                you have used my "How I made a Book" &amp;c for the newspaper syndicate—All right. What I am somewhat concerned ab't is
                that I have not seen the proof (which is always an important point with
                me)—&amp; my 100 slips—What I mainly write now for, is to say, if
                possible, to have the slips run off from your type if still standing, &amp; sent me
                here—Thanks for the prompt pay— </p>
