                    O'Connor included with his letter, but one appears to be "the New Zealand

                    John Macmillan Brown (1845–1935) of New Zealand's Canterbury College, who
                    visited Whitman in 1884. It is unclear what the title of the publication is but
                    it was apparently reviewed in London's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Nation</span> in the

                    one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,

                    December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
                    Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
                    become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
                    desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
