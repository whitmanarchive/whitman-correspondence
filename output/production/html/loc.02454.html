                    all and which he (J.W.W.) has referred to in one of his letters to you. He spoke
                    of him as a man who instead of shirking the "spectres of the mind" as so many
                    clergymen do has boldly faced &amp; slain them &amp; has emerged from the conflict
                    strengthened &amp; with a purer &amp; loftier faith. He is an altogether splendid fellow

                    member of our little circle of friends composed as it is of such heterogenous

                    seems to be an air of himself about it." It was because we knew that you were
