                    Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and
                    authority on the works of Keats and Shelley, and, starting in 1887, a
                    conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
                    correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
                    was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman materials (D. B. Weldon
