            <p class="tei_p">Went out yesterday afternoon on a short drive to the cemetery—&amp; have eaten 
                quite a hearty breakfast this forenoon—so you see I am getting along fairly. 
                Wallace is expected hourly. Dr. B[ucke] 
                is of course here yet, is hearty &amp; flourishing—expecting to take J. W. W[allace]
                on with him to Canada.
                Am alone at present—is abt 1½ p.m.—quiet &amp; sort o' warm—pleasant—rain last night.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1891-09-07"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday evening</span></span>.—Quite a little <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">levee</span> down in my front room 
                f'm 3 till after 5—I down there in the big chair by the window—six or seven persons—then at 5½ my supper. 
                No news of J. W. W. yet. Horace &amp; Dr. B. are going over to Phila 
                early forenoon to speir of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">British Prince</span>.
                I will keep this open to send by steamer by the 9th.</p>

                &amp; in good spirits—goes off to Canada with Dr. B. to-morrow night—had a good passage. 
                All is jolly. Respects to all friends.</p>
