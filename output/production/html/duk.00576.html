            of smith had a man to day to look
            at his house he would sell it 500 doll

            a trouble for you to get it he
            will doo the best he can but if you
            could send him a draft for
            five or six hundred it would
            accomadate him very much
            indeed he wants you to telegraph
            to him when you get this letter
            as he expects he will have to go
            to the foundry this week he
            says if  it wasent for our moving
            and his letting out the lower part
            he woulent care if it did stop
                he feels shure of getting money
            by the first of may he has tried
            to transfer the mortgage on this
            house offered the back interest
            and more besides but it all failed
            i dont suppose there hardly ever
                was such difficuly the real estate
            agent say it will be very different
            in a little while) george says this
            building without money is a bad business
            i suppose walter dea you got my
            letter of last week) there is 800 dollars
            to come from jeff yet but he cant pay
                but 200 dollar a month)
            the houses is both
            insured) if you cant send it walt
            without difficulty george wont think
            hard i told him if you could i knew
            you would)</div>
