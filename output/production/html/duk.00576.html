                    15, 1869. The date "March 15" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand on the
                    second page, and Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1869. Edwin Haviland
                    Miller agreed with Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:367). In March 1869 George Washington Whitman was struggling to keep his
                    housebuilding business afloat financially, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in this
                    letter asks Walt Whitman for a loan of "five or six hundred" on George's behalf,
                    the "cause of her writing." This direct request had been prepared two weeks
                    earlier when Louisa wrote on the reluctance of agents to lend money to George:
                    they instead sought the safety of government bonds (see her <a href="duk.00575">March 4, 1869</a> letter to Walt). Walt sent a bank
                    draft immediately after receiving this letter, and Louisa acknowledged George's
                    receipt of the draft (see her <a href="duk.00640">March 17, 1869</a>
                    letter to Walt). Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman confirmed Walt's loan to George
                    a week later (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00453">March 25, 1869</a> letter to

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    Whitman had agreed to lend his brother George Washington Whitman $2,000 (see
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00575">March 4, 1869</a> letter
                    to Walt Whitman). If there are "800 dollars to come," as Louisa wrote above,
                    George had already received six $200 installments from Jeff—with four
                    more to come. However, the set of installments may have differed. Louisa
                    attempted to provide a complete accounting in her <a href="duk.00581">June
                        23, 1869</a> letter to Walt: two installments from Jeff in the amount of
                    $500 each were followed by a series of installments of $200, which
                    George eventually expected would total $3,000 for a mortgage on top of the
                    initial $1,000 in two installments. It is unclear whether Jeff agreed to
                    provide $4,000 in full—$3,000 in $200 installments on top of
                    the initial $1,000—because he only loaned George $3,400, which was
                    $600 less than George expected. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00576_n13 note" id="duk.00576_n13"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
