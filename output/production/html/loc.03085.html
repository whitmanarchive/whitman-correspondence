                Nothing special to write ab't. Have just sold &amp; sent off to Eng'd
                my little p'k't-b'k L of G. Grip &amp; bladder trouble bad. Nothing new in the
                Ing[ersoll] address—will probably come off here in Phila: latter part of Oct.
                (I count Ing: as one of my noblest friends &amp; upholders)—John
                Burroughs has been here to see me—he is well &amp; hearty.
                I shouldn't wonder if you see him in Boston—
