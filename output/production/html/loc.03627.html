                retain any knowledge or the faintest recollection of who I am, 
                but last evening I chanced to read an interview reported in some News-paper, 
                which said you spent considerable time in writing
                to your friends, intimating that you enjoyed doing this.—While 
                reading this paragraph, an army (and no small army) of reminiscences 
                were called to my mind, prominent among which was the fact that YOU used to greet me
                so cordially when I happened to meet you which I most frequently did 
                at the junction of Penn. Ave. &amp; 7th. Strs., in Washington, D.C., 
                in about 1866 and 1868.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">2</a>—I was then employed in the Treasury Dept., at Washington.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">After my most cordial regards allow me to 
                say that I should feel SO proud to receive your autograph at the bottom 
                of a few words written by your hand; coming from YOU, I am assured they can
                be none but bright and kind words.</p>

                She also was in and wrote from Washington at that time.

                    Valerian) Stuart Redden (1844–1917) was a veteran of the Union Army who
                    briefly worked as a clerk for the U.S. Treasury Department in the late 1860s. In
                    1869, he married Elizabeth "Bessie" Povall Reeve, and the couple moved to
                    Louisianna and had one son, Stuart Reeve Redden. Redden worked as a stenographer
                    for various companies in New Orleans and lived with his family in nearby
                    Covington. An 1879 article in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Marshall Messenger</span>
                    reports that Redden "is the owner of an autograph album with a number of notable
                    autographs therein," including those of "distinguished men living and dead, who
                    have played conspicusous parts in American history" ("Interesting Autographs,"
                    [February 14 1879], 3). For more information, see Redden's obituary in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">St. Tammany Farmer</span> ("Capt. V. Stuart Redden," [June 9,

                    Searing (1839–1923) was an American journalist and poet. After losing her
                    hearing and speech due to childhood spinal menengitis, Searing enrolled in the
