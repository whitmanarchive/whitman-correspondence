            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to have the Birthday<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">1</a> book<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> the other day, with its record of so many
                friendly voices. Traubel<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">3</a> was very good to let mine be heard so
                prominently in the throng. I believe I even blushed a little to find my lines so
                bravely in evidence.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I write, the snow is falling, &amp; the sky is leaden overhead. A regular English
                winter's day! I wonder if it is the same at Camden whose streets and ferries I
                remember best under wintry aspects. At present I am quartered at
                Hampstead,—not far away from Gilchrist's<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">4</a> house in Well
                Road, tell him!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Hampstead is by far the highest part of London, &amp; this cottage is very near the top
                of the Heath, approaching 500 feet above the sea. I find it much healthier than the
                low-lying parts near the river. After the Welsh mountain winds, the regular London
                air is rather trying,—no oxygen, no stimulus, in it!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is much at Hampstead that you would like. The high road that runs along the top
                of the Heath, (called the Spaniards Road, &amp; passing an old inn where Skittles are
                still played, called "The Spaniards"), has a fine view down to London on the south &amp;
                the open country on the north. It is a fine walk either on a bright morning, or at
                night when the glamour in the sky &amp; the glitter of Camps below &amp; the hum of the city

                monster, London, lies there, hydra-like, with pains untold &amp; pleasures extreme in

            <p class="tei_p">Edith<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> &amp; I went to call on Miss Gilchrist<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">6</a> on Sunday last, &amp; found
                her very well. She said that her brother would probably be home in February. Some of
                his friends were beginning to think he meant to settle oversea for good. I suppose
                he is waiting to astonish us with a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">magnum opus</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have a young American novelist over here at present with his wife,—Henry
                Harland<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a> ("Sidney Luska.") They are very bright &amp; interesting, more rapid &amp; restless
                than we slow Englischers. He however in his turn seems to be astonished at the
                immense amount of hard writing that English men of letters get through.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03341.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03341.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03341.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03341.004.jpg</span> "It is your sedative
                climate which makes the difference," he says in discussing it. There's no doubt that
                the English climate does tend to concentrate one's energies.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">For my own part, I feel now that concentration is the one thing that I lack. Too many
                distractions in this hydra-headed London. It would be good to retire for seven years
                to some mountain solitude, &amp; there, hermit-like, work out the purposes of one's
                destiny,—as Carlyle did. Meanwhile this probation in a world's city is helpful
                &amp; good, fortunately, in other ways.</p>

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
