            <p class="tei_p">I ought to have written to you before, acknowledging the good package of books, duly received by express, &amp; actively used since, changing them around in places where most needed among the soldiers—(I found a small hospital of U. S. teamsters, entirely without reading, I go there considerable, &amp; have given them largely of your reading contribution)—I am down here pretty well toward the extreme front of the Army, eight or ten miles south of headquarters, (Brandy Station)—We had some fighting here, below here on picket lines, day before yesterday—We feared they, the rebs, were advancing upon us in our depleted condition, especially feared their making a flank movement up on our right. We were all ready to skedaddle from here last night, &amp; expected it—horses harnessed in all directions, &amp; traps packed up, (we have held &amp; lost Culpepper three or four times already)—but I was very sleepy &amp; laid down &amp; went to sleep, never slept fresher or sweeter—but orders came during the night to stay for the present, there was no danger—during the night I heard tremendous yells, I got up &amp; went out, &amp; found it was some of the men returning from the extreme front—As day before yesterday a strong force, three corps, were moved down there—These were portions of them now returning—it was a curious sight to see the shadowy columns coming in two or three o'clock at night—I talked with the men—how good, how cheerful, how full of manliness &amp; good nature our American young men are—I staid last night at the house of a real secesh woman, Mrs. Ashby—her husband (dead) a near relation of the famous reb Gen Ashby<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—she gave me a good supper &amp; bed—There was quite a squad of our officers there—she &amp; her sister paid me the compliment of talking friendlily &amp; nearly altogether exclusively with me—she was dressed in very faded clothes but her manners were fine, seems to be a travelled educated woman—quite melancholy—said she had remained through fearful troubles &amp; changes here on acct of her children—she is a handsome middle-aged woman—poor lady, how I pitied her, compelled to live as one may say on chance &amp; charity, with her high spirit—</p>

                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
                    gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry Boy and the
                        Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
                    had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the letter
                    from <a href="nar.00002">January 10, 1863</a>
                    . Though Trowbridge was
                    not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms
                    my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and greatness of
                    this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman,
                    "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>, 23
                    [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman

                        [PMLA]</span>, 63 (1948): 262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge
                    stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
                    D. O'Connor. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00305_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00305_n2"><span>Turner Ashby

                    and that he had heard from another soldier-patient that Babbitt had regained
                    "his strength, though not his voice." Trowbridge also reported that he had
                    written "a few days ago" to Chase on Whitman's behalf, and that Chase had
                    received the book—evidently the copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drummer Boy</span>
