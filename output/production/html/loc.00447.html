               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Tis a long time since I have written to you<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—not since I wrote a short note from Pittsburgh  I received a few days ago a paper (Boston) containing a notice of you<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—I was much pleased upon reading it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all pretty well all <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very</span> well except Mat  she has a bad cough<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—and she has had it so long that I begin to feel quite anxious that she should be rid of it  I have had a doctor examine her lungs two or three times but he says they are not as yet to any extent affected  I miss the advice and counsel of Dr. Ruggles<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> in all such cases much—Mat caught a bad cold when we first moved to the house<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> we are living in and she has not been entirely free from it since although she has been better once or twice—I am in great hopes however that in a few weeks she will get the better of it. How are matters progressing with you—I suppose as usual—is the hot weather in Washington pretty bad  We have had a visit from Grant<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> but he is coming and going like any other "man" and I guess it is a good thing people dont get excited [during] this hot weather</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What do you think of the selection of candidates by the New York Convention<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—rather a lame affair isnt it—but of all the poor devils old Chase<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> must feel the worse  I can not conceive of a more general "cave in" than Mr Chase[e] made—and our friend A. J.<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> cannot be over jovial at the result.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Do you ever see anything of Mason<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a>—if so how does he look and what will he do when Grant is elected Prest.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are progressing slowly with the work<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a>—not so fast as I hoped or expected—Yet I guess 'twill come out all right  We have most of the work under contract—one will be let tomorrow and but one or two more after that  I am kept pretty busy  the little questions of all kinds coming up require nearly all my time—we have a pretty large Engnring force—larger than they usually employ on work in the west—still none to many to keep every thing straight</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt cant you get some tickets on the next great Pacific Rail Road spree<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a> and come out and see us and if you or I can get the tickets Mat and I will join you and go to the end of the road—would[n't] it be a jolly good time—I suppose they will have a trip or two of that kind this fall</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went a few weeks ago on a little sail up and down the river with a party that were "doing" the "Editors Assotn"<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">13</a>  I was much amused by the style of a large number of them—particularly of the young style—like young Noah<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">14</a> used to be—fellows that thought that they had to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">look</span> the newspaper as well as report for one  The speeches were sickening—and the "eat" jolly—the sail splendid  I wish you could have been along—not so much that you might have seen the "eds" but that you might have enjoyed the sail—yet it was'nt the sail to Cony Island by a long ways.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What will be the result so far as you are concerned should Mr Evarts<a href="#n15" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r15">15</a> be made Atty Gen—will it make your place any less secure? Are your friends in Washington all right as regards their "sits" O'Conner<a href="#n16" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r16">16</a> and the rest—I suppose the political boiling is really more heard than felt in regard to office holding—I know lost [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>] of fellows in Brook[lyn] (and it is the same with Engineers) that always think they are going to be deprived of office and "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">clout</span>."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well Walt I have to stop and go home to dinner—you would be very welcome to go if you only could I can tell you—Mat and the Children would almost love you to-death  The children are growing nicely—Hattie has got so she can read a letter—Jess is still the baby and therefore dont learn or anything else but play—they both grow though quite fast—and will I think go through the hot season without much trouble—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you would write me when you can—a letter way off here is quite an event and highly prized</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give our love to Mother when you write and the same to yourself</p>

                    this time that it would be wrong to suggest he was neglecting Walt Whitman.
                    After receiving a letter from Jeff, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman remarked to Walt
                    Whitman on March 11, 1868: "i thought when i read it he must have written it
                    running for i could hardly make it out  he is very busy" (Trent Collection of
                    Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
                    Library). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00447_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00447_n2"><span>The only such notice in
                    a Boston paper for this month was Ferdinand Freiligrath's "Walt Whitman" in the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Commonwealth</span>, July 4, 1868. Freiligrath
                    claimed that "For his admirers, Whitman is the only American poet, derived from
                    the soil, expressing his age....He makes ordinary verse-making seem childish."
                    Surprisingly, Jeff noted Freiligrath's admiration of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> before Walt Whitman himself, who first mentions it on September
                    27, 1868 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>

                    Mattie's chronic sore throat on February 10, 1863 (see <a href="loc.00398">Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 10 February 1863</a>), but it
                    was only in 1868 that he began to express deep fears about her condition. For an
                    account of the progress of Mattie's disease, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> (New York:

                    parents, the Dents, who lived on a farm outside town. He deliberately avoided
                    public appearances, shrewdly preferring to play the role of the simple soldier
