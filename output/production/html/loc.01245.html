                sometimes pretty bad I fear, though never quite beaten. It is strange what a long

            <p class="tei_p">I have come out here, dear Walt, to spend the winter, partly or chiefly in order to
                get at first hand the results of the Eastern thought &amp; tradition in matters
                relating to religion—and the result is very interesting. I am staying just now
                with my friend Arunáchalam<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> whose name you may remember. He
                has been very much pulled in this direction lately—and his Guru or Teacher is
                also here. This people has an extraordinary genius for religion and the force with
                which they abstract themselves from the world in their endeavor towards union with
                the universal consciousness is something remarkable—&amp; such as we have
                little idea of in the West. That a certain few attain this union, and with it
                unusual powers, is quite evident—and in attaining<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01245.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01245.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01245.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01245.003_large.jpg</span> it they cast off all the bonds of

                religion of the people a hidden few who are perfectly democratic and whose
                watchwords are Freedom Equality &amp; Joy—and this has been the esoteric
                teaching of the Vedas<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> &amp; Upanishads<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> for now thousands of years.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The main method of attaining this union or emancipation is the suppression of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Thought</span> [which of course is abundantly indicated in yr L.

                gone you are one piece with the universe, &amp; by suppression you attain mastery
                and so can use thought or not use it, as you like.</p>

                everybody in contemplation of the divine being. Here I feel I cannot quite go with

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
