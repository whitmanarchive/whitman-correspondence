            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It's good to get your letter of Nov 2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nd</span> forwarded to me
                    here. Too bad my not acknowledging your
                books—they arrived all right sometime in Sept<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> and I
                forwarded one copy to the Fords. I like the
                edition—it has a good monumental character about it. Your writing (in this
                last letter) looks as if you were well as ever, but I expect you vary—and
                sometimes pretty bad I fear, though never quite beaten. It is strange what a long
                time of suffering you have had in later life—you who were so healthy when
                young.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have come out here, dear Walt, to spend the winter, partly or chiefly in order to
                get at first hand the results of the Eastern thought &amp; tradition in matters
                relating to religion—and the result is very interesting. I am staying just now
                with my friend Arunáchalam whose name you may remember. He
                has been very much pulled in this direction lately—and his Guru or Teacher is
                also here. This people has an extraordinary genius for religion and the force with
                which they abstract themselves from the world in their endeavor towards union with
                the universal consciousness is something remarkable—&amp; such as we have
                little idea of in the West. That a certain few attain this union, and with it
                unusual powers, is quite evident—and in attaining<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01245.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01245.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01245.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> it they cast off all the bonds of
                caste &amp; ceremonial &amp; become free; so that one finds here behind the outer
                religion of the people a hidden few who are perfectly democratic and whose
                watchwords are Freedom Equality &amp; Joy—and this has been the esoteric
                teaching of the Vedas &amp; Upanishads for now thousands of years.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The main method of attaining this union or emancipation is the suppression of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Thought</span> [which of course is abundantly indicated in yr L.
                of G.—tho' I don't know that it is actually formulated there]. When Thought is
                gone you are one piece with the universe, &amp; by suppression you attain mastery
                and so can use thought or not use it, as you like.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In the systematising and realising of these ideas these fellows here seem to have far
                outstripped us. On the other hand I think they are wanting in the<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01245.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01245.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01245.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> part of Love.
                The word does not attract them—they do not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">care</span> for
                others. They are gentle &amp; kind, but glad after all to forget the world &amp;
                everybody in contemplation of the divine being. Here I feel I cannot quite go with
                them—there is something cold &amp; abstract in the business!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">However it is possible that in the union of the East &amp; West both sides will be
                more perfectly represented &amp; balanced in the future than they have ever been
                before. Wonderful isn't it? how these things have been known &amp; worked out for
                ages.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to Dr Bucke if you write or see him—not
                forgetting H. Stafford, and with much love to yourself dear
                Walt &amp; many remembrances &amp; good hopes of rendezvous sometime or other</p>
