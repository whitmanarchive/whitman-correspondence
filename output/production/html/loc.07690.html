                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Civil War General Augustus James Pleasonton (1808–1894) started a health
                    craze based on his notion that the color blue (like the blue sky) promoted
                    growth in animals and plants, and he experimented by growing grapes and raising
                    pigs under blue glass. Many dismissed his claims as quackery, but others took
                    the claims seriously, and what Whitman called the "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">blue
                        glass</span> furore" lasted several years—with blue glass supposedly
                    curing a range of maladies from back pain to baldness—before being fully
                    debunked. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07690_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.07690_n2"><span>At this time, Whitman was
                    preparing a portfolio of self-portraits. He wanted to publish the portfolio, but
                    the project was never completed. Whitman did include several photographs (or
                    engravings of them) in the 1889 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                    Grass.</span> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4137">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4137 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4137"><span>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913) was the
                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
