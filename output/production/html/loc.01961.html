                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr Whitman</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter found me today. This is my permanent address. I live here in a large old
                house wh.
                
                belonged to my father—a house on a hill among trees looking down upon Bristol
                with its docks &amp; churches—a picturesque labyrinth of masts &amp; spires
                &amp; houseroofs.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter gave me the keenest pleasure I have felt for a long time. I had not
                exactly expected to hear from you. Yet I felt that if you liked my poem you would
                write. So I was beginning to dread that I had struck some quite wrong
                chord—that perhaps I had seemed to you to have arrogantly confounded your own
                fine thought &amp; pure feeling with the baser metal of my own nature. What you say
                has reassured me and has solaced me nearly as much as if I had seen the face &amp;
                touched the hand of you—my Master!</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01961.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">For many years I have been attempting to express in verse some of the forms of what
                in a note to Democratic Vistas (as also in a blade of Calamus) you call
                "adhesiveness." I have traced passionate friendship through Greece, Rome, the
                medieval &amp; the modern world, &amp; I  have now a large body of poems written but
                not published. In these I trust the spirit of the Past is faithfully set forth as
                far as my abilities allow.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was while engaged upon this work (years ago now) that I first read Leaves of
                Grass. The man who spoke to me from that Book impressed me in in every way most
                profoundly &amp; unalterably; but especially did I then learn confidently to believe
                that the Comradeship, wh. I conceived as on a par with the Sexual feeling for depth
                &amp; strength &amp; purity &amp; capability of all good, was real—not a
                delusion of <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01961.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> distorted
                passions, a dream of the Past, a scholar's fancy—but a strong &amp; vital bond
                of man to man.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yet even then how hard I found it—brought up in English feudalism, educated at
                an aristocratic public School (Harrow) and an over refined University
                (Oxford)—to winnow from my own emotions &amp; from my conception of the ideal
                friend, all husks of affectations &amp; aberrations &amp; to be a simple human
                being. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">You</span> cannot tell quite how hard this was, &amp; how you
                helped me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have pored for continuous hours over the pages of Calamus (as I used to pore over
                the pages of Plato), longing to hear you speak, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">burning</span>  for a
                revelation of your more developed meaning, panting to ask—is this <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01961.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> what you would
                indicate?—Are then the free men of your lands really so pure &amp; loving
                &amp; noble &amp; generous &amp; sincere? Most of all did I desire to hear from you
                own lip —or from your
                pen—some story of athletic friendship from wh. to learn the truth. Yet I dared
                not to address you or dreamed that the thoughts of a student could abide the
                inevitable shafts of your searching intuition.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Shall I ever be permitted to question you &amp; learn from you?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What the love of man for man has been in the Past I think I know. What it is
                 now, I know also—alas! What
                you say it can &amp; shall be I dimly discern in your Poems. But this hardly
                satisfies me—so desirous am I of learning what you teach. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01961.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Some day,
                perhaps—in some form, I know not what, but in your own chosen form—you
                will tell me more about the Love of Friends! Till then I wait. Meanwhile you have
                told me more than anyone beside.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been led to write too much about myself, presuming on what you said, that you
                should like to know me better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It will give me sincere pleasure to receive a copy of your book from you. I am
                grateful to you for purposing to give me so great a gift. Will you complete the
                benefit by sending me a portrait of yourself?—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is good to hear that your work does not deny you leisure. Work with an ample
                margin of freedom is the best thing for man; but I cannot believe in the modern
                Gospel of Work &amp; no <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01961.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01961.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> leisure. This ends in a Science of Human Mechanics.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I am free enough from home duties, I hope to be for America, on a tour with my
                wife. Then I shall request to be permitted to pay respect to you in
                person.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">That you may know my face I enclose 2 portraits. The little girl in one of them is my
                youngest child.</p>
