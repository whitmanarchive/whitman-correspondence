                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    (1818–1893) was a Union general in the Civil War and a leader among
                    Radical Republicans who pushed for the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson.
                    During the war, Butler was credited with labeling escaped fugitive slaves as
                    "contraband of war," and his soldiers occupied New Orleans. As a member of the
                    House of Representatives, he served as a prosecutor during the impeachment
                    proceeding in the Senate. For the request by Johnson's counsel that the trial be
                    postponed for 30 days (or 10 days), a request that was rejected, see "News of
                    the Day: Congress," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, March 24, 1868, 1.

                        and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
