                storm and georgey
                is laying on his oars to day i
            tell him i should pray for rainey days if i
            was him he is the inspector of the cementing part
            there has been much trouble about that part
            of the work the pipes have leaked and made much
            trouble georges work is not hard but dirty as
                he has to get down in the dich to see to it
            he sent one man away on his own
                responcibiltely as he 
                dident doo the work

            money and i got the one on the third with
            the money order
            i went down to the post
            office and got the money all very good
            i had owed amerman for a barrell of 
            flour for some time so i gave george 
            10 doll and he paid the balance 16 do was the amount
           so i feel releived of that debt ammerman
            is advertised to sell out and i wanted
            to pay him before he left and sent the accoun
            we remain all about the same as when i last
            wrote to you walter i think i feel better to

                but to day i feel intirely free from it
            have you been troubled with your old complaint
            walter in your head you say you have had
            a bad could i was in hopes you wouldent
                be troubled with it again  mary used to be
            troubled very much with that complaint
            she says she dont have it at all now
            i asked her what helped her she said hops
            steemed and put on her face was all that
            cured her i have not heard from  mary
            since she went away nor hann either
            for all she promised to write often to
            me i wish she would it would make
            her feel better i make no doubt i 
            dont know what i would doo if
            i dident get any letters) i have read
            the impeachment articles every day i
            was in hopes it would be carried through
            without any postponement i never had
            any idea butler was so smart
            i suppose
            the others is smart but he seems to fetch
            them up so quick)
            i have not had any letter
            from jeff or matty since i wrote to you
