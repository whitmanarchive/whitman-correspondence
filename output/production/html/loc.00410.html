               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Although I have little to write you about yet I thought I would just "drop you a line" as they say telling you that we all are in our usual style of liberty, health and pursuit of happiness. The latter of course under great difficulties as everything is so awful dear that you can hardly get enough to make a happy dinner on for less than 150<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">cts</span> but then we are doing the jolliest we can. How goes things with you. We dont hear from you as often as we used to. I hope you are not so engaged but that you can find time to write home? Do you visit the Hospitals as oftens as usual? I suppose so. I hope you are enabled to do as much good as formerly</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had quite a disappointment in a small way  There was a bill introduced in the Leg. to give the Brooklyn Sewer Com. the power to build a large sewer in Kent Av. raise the grade of the streets around there (Kent Av. from Flushing toward Williamsburg) &amp;c quite a large job and we all surely thought it would go through as it is very much needed, and Mr Lane had promised me charge of it. Indeed I had commenced making plans, profiles &amp;c when at the last moment the thing got squelched, but yet I dont know a[s] I am <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very</span> sorry for we still expect to get the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">new main</span>, that is to lay a new line of pipe from the Reservoir down to the city, and even if we dont do that why I shall have work enough to keep me along, doing anything and everything that turns up
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Andrew is about the same as when I last wrote you  no worse, and I think a little better. I do not see much of him as he comes to the house mostly when I am out. He visits Dr Ruggles now and then. The Dr thinks that he will gradually get over it. Mother had a little attack of her rheumatism yesterday and to-day and I am somewhat afraid that she will have more of it. She has been wonderful foolish in cleaning house as she calls it and has overworked herself. I dont think that she ought to do so, and so I tell her but she always answers that it's got to be done and that there is no one but her to do it, &amp;c  Mary and Louisa have gone home  They went Thursday last. Mother worked quite hard while they were here which may help account for the rheumatism in a measure. Mat is as jolly and good as ever. I am glad that she has no work from New York as twould be too much for her. Although she often speaks of writing you, yet she takes it out in talking, but she always wants to be remembered to you  Hattie is just the same little Harem-scarem and joyous little thing that she ever is. If she can only get out in the open air 'tis all she wants. It appears to be perfect pleasure to her, she dont seem to care about seeing anybody or going to any place, only get out in the air, that is all. Twould amuse you to see her when I go home, she seems to be glad enough, and always looks at me with an expression "well you've come and you are all right" but otherwise with the utmost indifference, and when I tell her to come and see me she says "what do I want to see you for" or at other times "What are you going to do with me." You would be pleased to see how finely she is growing, seemingly perfect health  We have heard from George but twice since he left home. I wish we could do so oftener.  Have not had a letter from Han since I wrote you</p>
