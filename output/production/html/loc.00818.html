            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I havn't heard any news from home now in more than a week, I hope you are well, dear Mother, &amp; all the rest too—there is nothing new or different with me—I can only write you the same old story about going to the hospitals &amp;c &amp;c.—I have not heard any thing since from George—have you heard any thing further?<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I have writ to him, to Annapolis—We are having it pretty warm here to-day, after a long spell of rain storms, but the last two or three days very fine—Mother, I suppose you got my letter of last Tuesday, 12th—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went down to the Capitol the nights of the debate on the expulsion of Mr Long<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> last week—they had night sessions, very late—I like to go to the House of Representatives at night, it is the most magnificent hall, so rich &amp; large, &amp; lighter at night than it is days, &amp; still not a light visible, it comes through the glass roof—but the speaking &amp; ability of the members is nearly always on a low scale, it is very curious &amp; melancholy to see such a rate of talent there, such tremendous times as these—I should say about the same range of genius as our old friend Dr Swalm,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> just about—you may think I am joking, but I am not, Mother—I am speaking in perfect earnest—the Capitol grows upon one in time, especially as they have got the great figure on top of it now, &amp; you can see it very well, it is a great bronze figure, the Genius of Liberty<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I suppose—it looks wonderful toward sundown, I love to go down &amp; look at it, the sun when it is nearly down shines on the headpiece &amp; it dazzles &amp; glistens like a big star, it looks quite curious—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, Mother, we have commenced on another summer, &amp; what it will bring forth who can tell?—the campaign of this summer is expected here to be more active &amp; severe than any yet—As I told you in a former letter Grant is determined to bend every thing to take Richmond &amp; break up the banditti of scoundrels that have stuck themselves up there as a "government"—he is in earnest about it, his whole soul &amp; all his thoughts night &amp; day are upon it—he is probably the most in earnest of any man in command or in the government either—that's something, ain't it, Mother—&amp; they are bending every thing to fight for their last chance—calling in their forces from southwest &amp;c—Dear Mother, give my love to dear brother Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all—I write this in my room, 6th st—</p>

                    of Representatives, moved for the expulsion of Long, but later approved a
                    resolution of censure: "That the said Alexander Long be, and he hereby is,
                    declared to be an unworthy member of this House." On April 15, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> observed sardonically: "One beneficial
