                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

                    Ellen O'Connor wrote at length of her husband's physical and emotional state: "I
                    am sorry that I have not better news to give you of William. He has failed very
                    much in the last six weeks, indeed I date the marked change for the worse from
                    the paralysis of the eye lid, &amp; that was the last of Sept. but a very marked
                    change for the worse since Nov. 23d. No one is as well aware of it as I am, for
                    I see him at his worst, as well as his best. I am his sole &amp; only nurse,
                    &amp; help to dress, undress &amp; bathe him, &amp; he is under no restraint to
                    say how he does feel to me, tho' he <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">always</span> puts the best
                    face on things to every one, &amp; is always ready to joke about himself &amp;
                    often makes me laugh when I am ready to cry. . . . Until lately, too, he has had
                    the most wonderful courage, &amp; would <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> give up, but
                    it is not so all the time now. Still, there is one thing in his favor, (if one
                    so regards it) &amp; that is that he is still <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">determined</span>
                    to live. I never saw such clinging to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this life</span>, in any
                    one; &amp; he still feels that if the right Doctor could be found that he could
                    be made entirely well. He counted up the other day, &amp; found that he had had
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fifteen</span> doctors. . . . But his deepest unhappiness
                    now is that he has not yet been able to get his article published which he wrote
                    in defense of Ignatius Loyola Donnelly [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mr. Donnelly's
                        Reviewers</span>]" (see O'Connor's letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.02953">December 20, 1888</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
