            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope the Rhys brothers have not gone to the bottom! It
                begins to fill me with alarum that we do not hear from the Croma in wh. he
                sailed. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I went in H. Williams &amp; Everetts this evening after
                work, &amp; passed a few rapt moments in looking at the bust of you which is
                handsomely mounted on a polished wood tall pedestal standing on the middle landing
                of the stairs &amp; just before a pier glass mirror—The very best position in
                the rooms. I then saw <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02912.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02912.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02912.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> that I had not really seen it at all in the right
                way—before (I mean) it was on a pedestal &amp; viewed at a distance. I gave it
                draining regards that fixed it in my mind. I regard it as a noble work, &amp; am
                very glad of this rich honor done to my poet, &amp; I want to congratulate Morse
                very heartily on it. It is a fine, nay a great, work, in my opinion.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It seems to me that the chief traits that emerge are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">compassion</span> blended with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">alert curiosity</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I don't know whether it strikes others so, or whether you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span></span>​  want these traits emphasized so much. I do see too, in some measure, the
                far forward look you spoke of in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr</span>​  good letter to me. But I think Morse might put more
                of the prophet or seer in it, or another one possibly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mrs. Fairchild &amp; her husband are going to drive out
                &amp; see my Cox photo, some time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Baxter has written you that we have written to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Boston Public Library​ ">Bost. Pub. Lib.</span>​  about acceptance of bust. They have a little
                gallery of sculpture—as I now remember, &amp; it will be a good place for it.
                Though <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> preferred the art museum. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02912.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02912.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02912.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> But Baxter likes to have his own
                way always.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I must ask him about his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Herald</span> notice of it. For we must
                draw attention to it. He seems to have acted on Sidney M's suggestion <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">abt</span>​  Williams &amp; Everett's being a better place than Chase's.</p>
