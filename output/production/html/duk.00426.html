                    she is quite poorly at times

                    Washington Whitman (1829–1901) returned home to Brooklyn for the first
                    time in sixteen months on a ten-day furlough, which ended on March 17. He
                    returned to his regiment in Newport News, Virginia. George was the sixth child
                    of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and he was ten years
                    younger than Walt Whitman. He enlisted in the Union army in 1861 and remained on
                    active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle
                    of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                    Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and
                    began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and later a
                    mason named French. George also took a position as inspector of pipes in
                    Brooklyn and Camden.
