                    to her that she would write
                    to you but it seems to hurt
                    her to bend over i think
                    she is quite poorly at times
                    but maybee when the
                    weather gets warm she
                    will improve

                    at any rate i do so
                    hope she may i did
                    think i would go on
                    there as soon as the weather
                    got warmer but jeff
                    and george dont seem

                    of taking care of myself
                    but i think i could go
