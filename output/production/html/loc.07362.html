            <p class="tei_p">Thursday—we have just had dinner &amp; I have come in the front room by the
                fire—A deep snow everywhere outside, but comfortable here—the little
                canary bird singing blythely &amp; I feeling pretty well for me though indeed as the
                hymn says—"Old age is creeping on with its great load of sin."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I havn't heard from you or seen any of you in some weeks—hope everything goes
                on right—Hope you or George or both of you will come here
                soon &amp; spend some hours &amp; stay to dinner—Mrs. Davis spoke of it Thanksgiving Day—&amp; we both would be glad to have you both
                come yet—Everything goes now with me about as usual—have not been as
                well as usual the last month—send one of Herbert's last
                letters enclosed—Dr. B[ucke] speaks of Harry in his last and wants to know if anything has been
                done—Love to you and George &amp; Ed &amp; all—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The roads and going are dreadful at present—</p>
