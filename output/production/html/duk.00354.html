            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just heard that there will be a chance to send letters home this morning, and I improve the oppernitunity to let you know that I am all right so far. We had a pretty hard battle on the 6th. I dont know what the battle is called but it was about 5 miles from Germania Ford on the Rapidan River.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> our Regt. suffered severely loseing 70 in killed and wounded.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I lost nearly half of my Co but we won the fight and the rebel loss was pretty heavy. We came here on the 8th and there has been fighting going on every day since we came here.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> We have had the best of the fighting so far and its my opinion that Genl Grant has got Lee in a pretty tight spot. We had a severe fight here on the 12th and the loss was heavy on both sides  our Regt lost 20 in killed and wounded  our forces took about 8000 prisoner[s?] and 40 peices of Artillery.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are now lying in Rifle pitts and things are very quiet this morning. We have plenty to eat and get along very well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Army is in first rate spirits and everyone seems confident and hopefull. I have not time to say much at present Mother but when I do get time I will write you a good long letter. You must not feel at all worried about me but take things Cool and comfortable as I do and above all dont worry.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Much love to all. Good Bye.</p>

                    killed; the Confederate loss probably exceeded 10,000. The Ninth Army alone lost
