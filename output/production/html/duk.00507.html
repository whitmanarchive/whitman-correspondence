                    Maurice Bucke later assigned the date of October 30, 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller
                    agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    1:378). October 30 fell on a Wednesday in 1867. The letter's concerns are
                    consistent with Louisa's <a href="duk.00506">October 22, 1867</a> and <a href="duk.00508">November 19, 1867</a> letters to Walt Whitman, and a

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ghost</span> (New York: G.P. Putnam, 1867). For a
                    time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with
                    Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates
                    during the Washington years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the
                    author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">11. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00507_n6 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00507_n6"><span>The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> printed this brief note: "Walt Whitman is about
