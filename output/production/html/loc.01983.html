                ones, basin &amp; pitcher the three tumblers &amp; one small pitcher I could make

            they have been used by you for some time; I have never used the room or things, if
                you do not ask too much for them I will take them—please write as soon as you
                get this &amp; let me know what you want for them as I am anxious to have all the
                cleaning done before the &amp;c return. Besides those things there are ten chairs

                    White, a chiropodist, and his wife Isabella A. White from March 1, 1871, until
                    Whitman left Washington following his stroke in 1873. Whitman had paid $236
                    in rent through June 10, 1873. On <a href="loc.01985">November 28,
                        1873</a>, Dr. White acknowledged for his wife receipt of $28 "on
                    account . . . for rent of room etc from May 1st/73." Whitman gave up one room at the Whites' on June 10, 1873:

                    Press, 1984], 2:942). Isabella White
                    had written, evidently early in July, about the rent due for his room; Whitman's
                    reply is not extant. In this letter, she offered to purchase Whitman's
                    bedstead and certain other effects. Whitman had not settled his account
                    when White wrote again on <a href="loc.01984">October 6, 1874</a>, and
                    offered him a credit of $10 for his furnishings against a balance of
                    $38. See also 
                    Whitman's <a href="loc.01649">July 10, 1874</a>, letter to Peter Doyle, in
                    which Whitman left instructions for the delivery of his boxes from the
                    Whites. </span></span></p></div>
