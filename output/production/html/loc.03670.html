            <p class="tei_p">I desire to bring under your notice the Christian Kingdom Society in the hope that
                you will sympathise with it—It is formed for the purpose of banding together
                people of different creeds, parties and countries, on the broad lines of loyalty to
                the Christian spirit. We do not enter into theological or ecclesiastical
                discussions, and we discourage all foolish disputations. We aim at bringing about
                those feelings of sympathy and goodwill among all people, for which you are also
                striving.
