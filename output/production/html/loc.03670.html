            <p class="tei_p">I desire to bring under your notice the Christian Kingdom Society in the hope that
                you will sympathise with it—It is formed for the purpose of banding together
                people of different creeds, parties and countries, on the broad lines of loyalty to
                the Christian spirit. We do not enter into theological or ecclesiastical
                discussions, and we discourage all foolish disputations. We aim at bringing about
                those feelings of sympathy and goodwill among all people, for which you are also

It would be such a great <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03670.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03670.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03670.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> pleasure to many of us to feel
                that although separated in many camps and living in many countries, we all belong to
                one great union—Should you feel that you can honestly accept our basis, it
                would be a great joy to some of us who have read your writings to have you also in
