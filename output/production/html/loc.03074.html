                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
