               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came right—&amp; was glad to hear from you, Nelly, &amp; Charles Eldridge &amp; dear little Jeannie—(I will not add William because I did not hear any thing about him.)
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nelly, the skies are brighter here than when I wrote you last. Little sis is so much better, that she has been twice brought down here to the front basement, &amp; has in every respect improved much since last Saturday—Then my mother arrived home last Tuesday—and now it looks something like <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">home</span> in reality—I am quite well—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Drum Taps will be bound (a small edition) before you get this—&amp; will next week be put in the hands of a New York publisher &amp; launched on the market—at least that's my design at present—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">When you write tell me all about William—My mother returns bringing cheerful intelligence upon the whole—&amp; is herself in splendid condition—havn't seen her look &amp; apparently feel better in many years—My brother George (or did I tell you?) is working again at his trade &amp; has grand health—Love &amp; Farewell—</p>
