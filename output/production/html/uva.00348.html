                    (1825–1878), translator of Goethe's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faust,</span>
                    journalist, and traveler, sent his "Picture of St. John" to Whitman on <a href="loc.00871">November 12, 1866</a>. He commended Whitman's
                    "remarkable powers of expression" and "deep and tender reverence for Man." His
                    letter of <a href="loc.00872">December 2, 1866</a> was even more
                    unreserved in its praise. Later Taylor's enthusiasm for Whitman was to change
                    dramatically. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Echo Club</span> (2d ed., 1876),
                    154–158, 168–169, Taylor burlesqued Whitman's poetry. William Sloane
                    Kennedy lists him among Whitman's "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Villifiers";
                    see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of a Book for the World</span> (West Yarmouth,
