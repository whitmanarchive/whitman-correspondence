            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter of the 12th. The friendly pages thereof have given me pleasure, &amp; I wish to proffer you my friendship in response. Should I not see you at the lecture, I hope you will do me the honor to call upon me at the Attorney General's office here, in the Treasury Building, where I am employed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your book also came safely. I accept it, as a kind &amp; valuable gift—&amp; heartily thank you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Permit me to send you, in return, a copy of the new edition of Leaves of Grass. I send it herewith by same mail.
Truly hoping to see you—for the present, Farewell.</p>
