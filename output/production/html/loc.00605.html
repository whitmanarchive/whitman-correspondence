                        <a href="loc.00596">September 17, 1863</a>, from the U. S. General
                    Hospital at Carlisle, Pennsylvania: "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A
                    hurry." He expected, he explained on <a href="loc.00598">September 28,
                        1863</a>, to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near
                    Washington when he wrote on <a href="loc.00889">October 13, 1863</a>. He
                    wrote on <a href="loc.00601">December 16, 1863</a>, from Culpepper,
                    Virginia, that he was doing provost duty, and on <a href="loc.00602">February 28, 1864</a>, he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virgnia,
                    where "the duty is verry hard." He was wounded again on June 11, as his parents
                    reported to Whitman on <a href="loc.00603">August 29, 1864</a>, was
                    transported to Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on
                    August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30,
                        1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have
                    drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave
                    the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on <a href="loc.00882">October 22, 1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman from
                    Queensbury, New York. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten
