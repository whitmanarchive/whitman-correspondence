                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, even
                    though Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently
                    defended Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
                    commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
                    was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
                    men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
                    write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span> (New York: American News Co.,
                    1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1896),
                    and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting the Universe</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
                    1920). For more information on Burroughs see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
                    (1836–1917)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00316_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00316_n2"><span>Probably Whitman sent
                    this issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> because of Lowell's
                    poem "To J. B." According to an annotation in the Harvard Library copy of the
                    magazine, J. B. is John Bartlett, the compiler of quotations. One of Burroughs's
                    friends, interestingly, was Joel Benton, a poet and reviewer; see Clara Barrus,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston:
                    Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), 18. The magazine also contains an account of
                    Ferrero's (and therefore George's) siege at Knoxville. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00316_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00316_n3"><span>For a time Whitman lived
                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
                    Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
                    intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
                    clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
                    however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
                    on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00316_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00316_n4"><span>John J. Piatt met Whitman
                    on New Year's Day, 1863. Piatt was a versifier and author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Two Friends</span> in collaboration with W. D. Howells; see Barrus,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> (1931), 43. On
                    February 12, 1866, he wrote a sympathetic account of Whitman and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span> for the Columbus (Ohio) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Morning Journal</span>; see Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman
                        and Burroughs—Comrades</span> (1931), 10, and William Sloane Kennedy,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of a Book for the World</span> (West Yarmouth,
                    Massachusetts: The Stonecroft Press, 1926), 17. Burroughs quoted from Piatt's
                    article in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman</span> (1867), 84–85. The
                    Washington Directory of 1866 listed Piatt as a clerk in the Treasury Department;
                    according to Barrus, he was later librarian of the House of Representatives and
                    then consul at Cork (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span>
                    [1931], 12). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
