      <p class="tei_p">I have come over this afternoon to the office, &amp; am now writing this at my desk. I did
        not succeed in working any—was not well enough the past week—although I have not
        gone behindhand—but as I sit here this afternoon, it appears to me I shall be able to
        make a commencement next Monday—for, though feeble, I feel just now more like work
        than any time yet—We have had real blowy March weather here to–day, sudden &amp;
        fitful showers &amp; heavy clouds &amp; wind—&amp; now it is quite clear and
        pleasant—I cannot walk around yet but feel in good spirits—am pleased to feel as
        well as I do, &amp; get along as well as I do—Mother, I do not show my sickness in my
        looks, in flesh or face, except very little perhaps—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I will finish to–morrow or next day—</p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday night—8 o'clock</span>—I still feel as well as
        yesterday, &amp; have been out twice to–day, riding in the cars, &amp; walking a
        little—I get in the cars right at my door, &amp; am brought back there again—It
        has been a beautiful day—I am now sitting in my room, by the stove, but there is
        hardly need of a fire—Peter Doyle is here for a couple of hours—he is
        reading—the doctor has been in to–day—he says I am getting along very
        well—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Monday afternoon <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>1 o'clock </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am over at my desk in the office again, writing this. I have rec'd your letter
        that the money come safe. I have just written a letter to Jeff,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>
        &amp; enclosed Josephine's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> &amp; yours in it—I am feeling
        on the gain—but still very slowly. I am taking some medicine, to restore
        strength—yesterday was perhaps my best day—though I feel middling to-day—I
        have not sent the Graphics containing my pieces<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> as I have not
        had but one copy, &amp; sometimes not that—I send papers to–day—Mother,
        you write me what envelopes you want directed to any of them, &amp; I will send
        them—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is gusty here but quite pleasant—I am feeling quite comfortable, &amp; shall soon
        be walking around I feel confident—I want to come on to Camden, but wish to get a
        little more able to move around first—Love to you &amp; all, Mother dear,</p>

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    left for Europe in 1872 (Library of Congress). The letter which Walt read was
                    sent from Belgium, according to Louisa's letter to Helen Price of March 31, 1873
