        <span class="tei_salute">Dear mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have come over this afternoon to the office, &amp; am now writing this at my desk. I did
        not succeed in working any—was not well enough the past week—although I have not
        gone behindhand—but as I sit here this afternoon, it appears to me I shall be able to
        make a commencement next Monday—for, though feeble, I feel just now more like work
        than any time yet—We have had real blowy March weather here to–day, sudden &amp;
        fitful showers &amp; heavy clouds &amp; wind—&amp; now it is quite clear and
        pleasant—I cannot walk around yet but feel in good spirits—am pleased to feel as
        well as I do, &amp; get along as well as I do—Mother, I do not show my sickness in my
        looks, in flesh or face, except very little perhaps—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I will finish to–morrow or next day—</p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday night—8 o'clock</span>—I still feel as well as
        yesterday, &amp; have been out twice to–day, riding in the cars, &amp; walking a
        little—I get in the cars right at my door, &amp; am brought back there again—It
        has been a beautiful day—I am now sitting in my room, by the stove, but there is
        hardly need of a fire—Peter Doyle is here for a couple of hours—he is
        reading—the doctor has been in to–day—he says I am getting along very
        well—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Monday afternoon <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>1 o'clock </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am over at my desk in the office again, writing this. I have rec'd your letter
        that the money come safe. I have just written a letter to Jeff,
        &amp; enclosed Josephine's &amp; yours in it—I am feeling
        on the gain—but still very slowly. I am taking some medicine, to restore
        strength—yesterday was perhaps my best day—though I feel middling to-day—I
        have not sent the Graphics containing my pieces as I have not
        had but one copy, &amp; sometimes not that—I send papers to–day—Mother,
        you write me what envelopes you want directed to any of them, &amp; I will send
        them—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is gusty here but quite pleasant—I am feeling quite comfortable, &amp; shall soon
        be walking around I feel confident—I want to come on to Camden, but wish to get a
        little more able to move around first—Love to you &amp; all, Mother dear,</p>
