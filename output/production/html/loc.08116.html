                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Medicine in Berlin in 1890, Dr. Robert Koch (1843–1910)—a German
                    physician and microbiologist—announced a substance known as "tuberculin"
                    or "Koch's lymph" that he argued would provide a remedy for tuberculosis. It was
                    later found to be more useful as a diagnostic tool for determining whether a
                    person was infected with tuberculosis. Dr. Koch is known for his identification
                    of the causative agents of tuberculosis, anthrax, and cholera, and he made key
                    contributions to the improvement of laboratory techniques in microbiology and in
                    the field of public health. He earned the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
                    for his research on tuberculosis in 1905. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n6121">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n6121 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n6121"><span>James William Wallace
