            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your two letters, full of memoranda, of May 28 and 30 came duly. I have "toiled
                terribly," as Cecil said of Raleigh, and sent off another letter to the Tribune,
                which I think will make Mr. Chadwick wear a toupee, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> for I have snatched him
                bald-headed. It has cost me great labor, though you may not think so when you read
                it, it runs off so savagely easy; but the difficulty in a controversy of this kind
                is to mould everything so as not to lay yourself open, and to give no points to the
                enemy, and this costs <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> time and care. My old fencing-master, Boulet, (no better ever
                lived; he taught once at West Point,) taught me always to cover my breast with hilt
                and point, even in the lunge, and I think of his lessons when engaged in fence of
                another kind. I hope I have succeeded in being both guarded and bold <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> in this new
                encounter with Chadwick.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have freely used the memoranda you sent, and got in as much of it as I could see my
                way to employ, and as much as I dared. I think you will feel satisfied with the use
                I have made of it. Some things I thought it prudent to withhold, because <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                they might provoke replication when we are not
                in a position to defend ourselves, not being ever sure that a single organ is open
                to us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You must be very careful in this matter. Even <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">words</span> must be
                carefully chosen, for the enemy is unscrupulous <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>and uses every advantage we give
                him. I came near getting into a pretty scrape by trusting to your memorandum about
                the appearance of Emerson's letter in Cooke's memoir published by Osgood. It was a
                splendid point to make, that the letter appeared <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.007_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> verbatim in a book issued with
                Emerson's own sanction a year ago, and I worked it in and made the most of it. But
                at the last, I thought it would be prudent to see the book, and there was the letter
                sure enough, but with a lot of remarks by the editor to the effect that "it is
                understood" (the usual <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>sneaking lie in putting it) that Emerson had considerably
                modified his feeling, and regretted, etc., etc. Fortunately, there is not a word in
                the preface to show that the book had Emerson's sanction,—but just see the
                scrape I would have been in had I used the information in the shape you sent it!!
                    <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.009_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.009_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.009_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                Indeed, Walt, you ought to be more careful, "A
                wild and many-weaponed throng, hang on our front and flank and rear." If I had said
                that the letter was reprinted in a book with Emerson's sanction, Chadwick would have
                had me. Our stronghold is the Emerson letter, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">unretracted by
                    himself.</span>

                shall have to meet, will be the stories of what Emerson <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">said</span> to this man or that man. We must deny them all, and call for proof.
                Let us admit nothing. Make the other side <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prove</span> their
                allegations.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope my new letter will be as successful with you and the public <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.011_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03044.011_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03044.011_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> as my first. My
                aim has been to shut Chadwick up for good, for I don't want to be bothered on a side

            <p class="tei_p">Letters are pouring in upon me. One from John Hay, very cordial. One from the
