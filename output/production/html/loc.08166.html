                visit yesterday to Lord Tennyson.<a href="#n0625" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0625">11</a> I was (as I have said) at Mr S.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">s</span>  and he sent me 
                with a man &amp; buggy to L. T.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">s</span> place some 5 ms. away. I drove thro' one of the wildest
                and most beautiful pieces of country (in a drizzling rain) that I have seen anywhere, hills, woods, brush, everywhere,
                but with splendid <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">English</span> roads to drive on. Got to T.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">s</span> place
                (a fine almost stately mansion) a little before 4 P.M. got out, rang the bell—a footman opened the door,
                I gave him your letter and my card &amp; said "please give these to Lord Tennyson." He left me in the hall and disappeared
                in the house—soon he came back and conducted me into a room on the ground floor to the left of the main hall—I went
                in and sat down—in a few minutes a quite young looking and handsome man came in—he held out his hand to me and said
                "good day to D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B." I shook hands with him saying at same time "you are Hallam Tennyson?"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">12</a>

                was sleeping—that he always lay down for a couple of hours in the afternoon &amp; would not be up until 5 O'C. he asked
                me if I would wait—I said certainly I would wait if he thought L. T. would see me. He said "I don't know, but I would like
                you to wait" then he asked me if I would step in and see Lady T.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">13</a> I said I sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> be very happy to do so.
                He took me to the next room where L. T. was lying on a sofa—a very pale &amp; delicate but a very spiritual, intellectual

                Mrs C.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">16</a> (she said they were not understood,

                manner and we had quite a little talk. (I had been at least half an hour with Lady T. and it was now nearly 5 O'C.)
                A little before 5 Hallam asked me to go with him to Lord T.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">s</span> room—I did so. I found L. T.
                in a large room on the first floor (up one stair, as yours is) containing bookshelves and many books—he was sitting on a sofa 
                and as I went in did not see me so as to know who was there —in fact when I went up to him he thought I was Hallam—I spoke
                to him and took his hand (which he thought strange thinking I was H.) however he soon realized who it was and there welcomed me. We then talked
                with perfect unconstraint for an hour. T. is not much for compliments, very blunt and downright—he spoke of you with
                much good feeling but my reception at the house, by the whole family, was a far greater compliment to you than a volume of soft phrases
                would have been.</p>

                or less vague way that you are a great force in this modern world. Had I been introduced to the Tennysons by the greatest prince in Europe 
                they could not have received me more courteously, nor had I been a near relative could they have shown me greater friendliness—all this
