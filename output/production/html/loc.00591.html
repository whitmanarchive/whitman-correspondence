         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> received a letter from you last March and answered it while at Fort Union<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>, but have never heard from you since.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well here I am camped on a sand bank on the Rio Grande River the weather is hot and we have seen little of the good things of America in the shape of Grub and Clothing but we have a Regament composed of natures Noblemen. we left Denver poorly clothed and equipped in the month of February, marched to Fort Union a distance of four hundred miles in fifteen days, two days we marched forty miles a day and then hearing that the Texans were marching on Fort Union we marched over seventy miles in twenty four hours. I believe that was the best marching made by any Reg in the Service. We being short of provision and destitute of Clothing our men stood it bravely and never murmured.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Texans flushed with success having whipped three thousand Regulars and volunteer mexican troops at Fort Craig were marching boldly on towards Fort Union laying the country waste wherever they went. We all eager to try our Reg. marched one hundred miles and met the enemy on their own ground in Apache Country in the mountains   our force of nine hundred theirs of two thousand we fought seven hours some times hand to hand over rocks stumps and trees regular bush whacking Indian fighting the Texans loss was about five hundred killed and wounded, ours about one hundred and eighty we burned sixty of their wagons loaded with provisions, clothing, ammunition and valuables leaving them destitute<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> they commenced their retreat the next day we followed a few days after joined Gen Canbys<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> force at Alberquerque, drove the ensuing two hundred miles like a flock of sheep At Peralta we had another little battle where we took seven wagons and a number of Prisoners   they said they did not mind fighting Regular troops but there was no use fighting Chivingtons Grey blouse Pikes Peak Sons of bitches so they burned all they had and fled to the mountains making for Texas with all possible speed and I am inclined to believe that they will never have any inclination to come to New Mexico again. Our Colonel Chivington was a Methodist Preacher Presiding elder in Colorado he is about six feet four inches high and built in proportion a first rate fellow and liked by his Regiment.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have marching orders now to join Col Carlton's<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> California troops about three hundred miles south of here   I expect we will start in about a week. we are getting tired of lying still although we have our sports, to night we have a swimming match for a purse of $30. they are to swim across the Rio Grande our Boys have built houses for themselves some of mud some of willow and some have dug houses in the bank by the River and live quite comfortable. I am afraid you will not find much in this letter to interest you for I am in no humor for writing to day. I may do better next time   I hope to hear from you before long,</p>

                    (1838–1865) was raised by an abolitionist father, Amasa Soule, who moved
                    the Soule family to Kansas to help fight for Kansas's anti-slavery status. With
                    his father and brother William, Silas was a member of the "Jayhawkers," a band
                    of abolitionists who assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad. Silas was
                    among the Kansas team assembled and brought to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by
                    Richard Swinton to break John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron
                    Stevens out of jail in Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia). In Harrisburg
                    he would have met William W. Thayer, who helped Richard Hinton and Thomas
                    Wentworth Higginson plan the jailbreak. On February 18, 1860, Soule went to
                    Charlestown from Harrisburg and faked public intoxication in order to be
                    imprisoned in the same jail as Hazlett and Stevens, only to be talked out of the
                    jailbreak by them. Soule attended a public memorial for Hazlett and Stevens in
                    Boston, where Thayer and Eldridge were in attendance. After the death of his
                    father in 1860, Soule followed the gold rush to Denver, but enlisted in the
                    Union army as soon as news of the war reached him. In 1864 Soule defied orders
                    by refusing to join Colonel John M. Chivington's attack on a group of unarmed
                    Native Americans, which later came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Soule
                    would later testify against Chivington in hearings in Denver. Soule married
                    Hersa Coberly, the daughter of a pioneer family, on April 1, 1865. Three weeks
                    later he was murdered on the streets of downtown Denver by a private from the
                    Second Colarado infantry and an accomplice. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00591_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00591_n2"><span>Fort Union, Albuquerque, was
