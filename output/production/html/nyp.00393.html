            <p class="tei_p">Early in the year 1863—I think in the final month—I lay on a cot in Mother Whippy's Ward

                in Washington D.C. sick "Nigh unto death" when there came in one day, with charitable intent, a stalwart 
                man of genial appearance &amp; seemingly past the middle age since his hair &amp; face beard were 
                plentifully sprinkled with white. This man (whose frame, as I afterward found, was no mean type of 
                the generous heart within) came to my bed, sat down, &amp; after some talk with me wrote a letter 
                to my parents in Michigan. This act secured my gratitude &amp; we became intimately acquainted &amp; 
                close friends—Being furloughed in July '63 &amp; discharged while in 
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Michigan​ ">Mich.</span>​  I lost sight of my friend &amp; I am not 
                sure that I even heard of him until I returned in '64 with an ugly bullet hole through my left lung

            <p class="tei_p">My friend was still in Washington, we met, &amp; our intimacy was renewed and again abruptly broken 
                off in the summer of '65 when I was transferred to New Haven &amp; soon afterward discharged from the 
                service. Although I have never since heard a word from my quondam friend, still the name Walt Whitman 
                is a household one in our family &amp; the picture (by Schaff)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> with the

                    patient at Judiciary Square Hospital, where he remained until sometime in 1863.
                    Knapp reconnected with Whitman in 1864 when he was being treated at Armory
                    Square Hospital for a bullet wound through his lungs. In 1883, Knapp was
                    principal of Public School No. 13 in Rochester, New York. He would later
                    work as a government employee in Washington, D. C. The wounds he sustained
                    during the Civil War eventually caused his death ("Albert G.

                    most frequently visited in Washington, D.C., during the Civil War. Because of
                    Armory Square's location near a steamboat landing and railroad, it received the
                    bulk of serious casualties from Virginia battlefields. At the end of the war, it
                    recorded the highest number of deaths among Washington hospitals. See Martin G.
