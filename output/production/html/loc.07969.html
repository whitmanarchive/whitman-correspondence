            <p class="tei_p">Pretty bad days and nights with me—very hot weather cont'd—the bladder 
                aff'r broke out worse—thank the dear friends for urging you to 
                come on a trip to America largely on my acc't, 
                &amp; thank you for considering it but I feel that y'r decision in the negative 
                is the best and wisest, &amp; approve it decidedly—Suppose 
                you have had some tremendous talks with Dr B[ucke] 
                (he carries heavy guns)—Did you get y'r duplicate photos? the one with * on back was a faithful pict: 
                of me period f'm '60 to '70
                (the war time) &amp; was the favorite of Wm &amp; 
                Mrs: O'Connor—the head on white paper unmounted was taken in the 
                war toward close, down in Virginia—I believe you are to get one of each those two—Horace 
                is gone to Wash'n, 
                returns to morrow—I rec: letters &amp; papers, best 
                thanks—a little breeze springs up as twilight comes—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">July 20—Yrs of 10th rec'd this mn'g &amp; well 
                conn'd—heat cont'd—Warry is down stairs practising 
                on his fiddle—the agent of some suburban lots has just been to see me 
                (I have a notion of investment)—all goes on as fairly as c'd be expected—
