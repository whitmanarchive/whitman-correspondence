                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
                    Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:
