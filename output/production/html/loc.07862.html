                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    to the public scandal that occurred when the Irish soldier and member of
                    Parliament Captain William O'Shea (1840–1905) named Charles Stewart
                    Parnell, the leader of Irish Parliamentary Party, as a co-respondent in divorce
                    proceedings. Parnell had a long-lasting affair with O'Shea's wife Katharine
                    O'Shea, and there was considerable fear that the scandal would jeopardize
                    support for Home Rule in Ireland. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07862_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.07862_n5"><span>Throughout 1890, the U.S.
                    government was concerned about the increasing influence of the Ghost Dance
                    spiritual movement on the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota; under the
                    mistaken impression that the Sioux chief Sitting Bull was a Ghost Dancer,
                    reservation police on December 15 attempted to arrest him and killed him in the
                    process. This is the "raid" Whitman refers to here. Two weeks later, 250 Sioux
                    were massacred near Wounded Knee Creek, ending the Ghost Dance movement. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n4137">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4137 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4137"><span>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913) was the
                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
