                    Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
                    (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
                    and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about

                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the

                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in
