            <p class="tei_p">Yours came this mn'g—welcome as always—the photo has not come yet—Thankful &amp; even exulting that you are
                satisfied with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: Boughs</span> inward &amp; outward—It is
                upon the whole what I wanted &amp; planned, especially the "Backwards Road" piece
                (as O'C[onnor] says "that's what I deliberately said, &amp; I
                stand by it")—with that, &amp; Nov. B. &amp; probably all
                I have uttered, I have a considerate eye not at all to itself alone, but to its
                place with all the rest I have uttered, &amp; also to the future &amp;
                permanency—many sharp readers might not think so, but I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have</span>—Don't make
                much calculation of the complete Vol. It will be I hope a respectable looking piece
                of typography &amp;c. but nothing to brag of—but it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">authenticates</span> probably
                better than any thing yet—there were several errors hitherto—not serious
                perhaps but errors—all these have of course been corrected, &amp; as I look
                over the pp. there appears not to be any typographical or any other blemish—(I
                am quite sure of that with L of G. throughout)—&amp; there will be five or six
                likenesses from life—&amp; autograph—Then this ensemble idea haunts me
                till I get it realized in an identity volume—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am a little fearful ab't our dear O'C—eagerly look for word—Matters so so with me—good bowel clearance
                to-day—word from my friend Linton from Eng[land]
                to-day—he is well—Shall have some oysters for my dinner ab't
                4—made my breakfast of a big roast apple &amp; some Graham bread—the sun
                is out—</p>
