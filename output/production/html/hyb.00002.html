                        March 16, 1870. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "16" in her own
                        hand, and Edwin Haviland Miller assigned the date December? 16, 1868 (Walt
                        Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). Miller probably dated this letter
                        according to Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's December 1868 visit to
                        Brooklyn. But Miller's date is too early: Mattie also arrived in Brooklyn
                        during February 1870 and departed on March 14, 1870, a Monday. This letter
                        is associated with Mattie's early 1870 visit to Brooklyn.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Mattie departed from her month-long visit to Brooklyn on March 14, 1870, and
                        her daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa had not accompanied her on the
                        trip (see Louisa's <a href="tex.00174">February 23, 1870</a> letter to
                        Walt Whitman). The date of Mattie's departure from Brooklyn and her expected
                        arrival in St. Louis matches Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's March 18,
                        1870 letter to Louisa (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
                            Whitman</span> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 143). Jeff
                        returned to St. Louis on February 26, 1870 while Mattie remained in Brooklyn
                        (see Mattie's February 27, 1870 letter to Walt in Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span>
                        [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 68). During her trip, Mattie
                        planned also to visit Washington, D.C., and to stay with William D. and
                        Ellen M. O'Connor, but those plans were scuttled (see Mattie's March 1, 1870
                        letter to Walt Whitman [Waldron, 69–70]). This letter from Louisa
                        indicates that Mattie will not travel to Washington, and Louisa asked Walt
                        to thank the O'Connors on Mattie's behalf. Joseph Phineas Davis has also
                        visited Louisa in Brooklyn, and his visit is consistent with his recent
                        departure from St. Louis to become an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts (see
                        Mattie's February 27, 1870 letter to Walt [Waldron, 68–69]). Finally,
                        the damaging storm that Louisa noted at the close of the letter was reported
                        in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> just days after Mattie's
                        departure for St. Louis (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00593">March 23,
                            1870</a> letter to Walt). This letter is consistent with Mattie's
                        March 14, 1870 departure from Brooklyn after an extended visit, with her
                        cancellation of a planned trip to Washington and a stay with the O'Connors,
                        with Davis's visit to Brooklyn on his way to Lowell, and with the date of a
                        severe storm, so it dates March 16, 1870.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Pieces of this letter are held in two repositories. The portion of the letter
                        in the Yale Collection of American Letter is incomplete and lacks a closing.
                        The remainder of the letter was discovered in January 2012 by Kenneth M.
                        Price and Brett Barney, in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection (Library of
                        Congress). The portion in the Feinberg Collection lacks a date and
                        salutation but has a closing. Louisa's references to Mattie's expected
                        arrival in St. Louis and to a "terrible storm" confirm that the newly
                        discovered Feinberg leaf is the remainder of Louisa's March 16, 1870 letter
                        in the Yale Collection.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r12">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_hyb.00002_n13 note" id="hyb.00002_n13"><span>Walt had not visited

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
