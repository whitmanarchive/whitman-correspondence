            only called mrs Lane
            and mrs kirkwood they only 
            called)
                but we had anna vanwyk
            2 days last week and altogether
            i got kind of worked down
            but i shall get rested now
            i think it was much better for
            matt to not go to washington
            this winter but she made such
                preperations for it that she  
            could hardly give it up
            say to mrs Oconor that
            marthe thanked her for her
            kind letter and will write
            to her as soon as she gets
            a little rested from he journy
            remember me also to mr and
            mrs Oconor and Jennie also
            martha was very much better
            when she left than when she cam<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">e</span>
                you cant think how she improve<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">e</span>
            before she went away she had
            a good appetite when she came
            she could not eat but very
            litle the doctor sounded her lung<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">s</span>
            with rather favorable result
            her left lung is good and three
            fourths of the right one) it had 
            not made such progress as he
            anticipated) she slept up stairs
            but had no fire except the
            very cold nights as it made her
            coughf) she wants to come
            out there without fail) davis has been
            here
            on his way to lowel 
            he said
            he never was in a place he liked
