            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came to me just when I most needed the comfort of it—when I was watching and tending my 
                dear Mother as she gently, slowly, with but little suffering, sank to rest. There was no sick bed to sit 
                by.—We got her up and out into the air and sunshine for an hour or two even the day before she died—No

                disease, only the stomach could not do its work any longer &amp; for the last three weeks she lived wholly 
                on stimulants, suffering somewhat from sickness. She drew her last breath very gently, before daybreak on 
                the 15th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="instant​ ">inst.</span>​ , in her 90th year, which she had entered in

                She looked very beautiful in death, notwithstanding her great age—as well she might—tranquil 
                sunset that it was of a beautiful day—a fulfilled life—joy &amp; delight of her father in youth

                the comfort your dear letter was &amp; is to me. Thinking over &amp; over the few words you say of 
                yourself—&amp; what is said in the paper (so eagerly read—every word so welcome) I cannot help 
                fancying that the return of the distressing sensations in the head must be caused by your having worked at 
                the book—the "Two Rivulets"<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">1</a> (I dearly <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">love</span> 
                the title &amp; the idea of bringing the Poems &amp; Prose together so)—that you must be more patient 
                with yourself and submit still to perfect rest—&amp; that perhaps in regard to the stomach—you 
                have not enough adapted your diet to the privation of exercise—that you must be more indulgent to the 
                stomach too in the sense of giving it only the very easiest &amp; simplest work to do.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
