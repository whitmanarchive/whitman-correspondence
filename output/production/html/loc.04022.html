                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Ruthey</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter and was glad to hear from you by your own writing. You must be
                having good times over there at Glendale. Do you all like it there as well as the
                old farm? Well Ruth it is now over six months since I have seen any of you except
                    Harry. The last three I have been away in New
                York—return'd only a few days ago—I am well and fat, &amp; have been so,
                &amp; my visit &amp; lecture &amp; jaunts on the water &amp; seashore &amp;c. all
                did me good.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00270.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00270.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00270.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">Tell your mother that the baby born over two years ago when Mrs Johnston died there
                in N Y is still living &amp; though not rugged is a nice sweet little child—He
                is named Harry—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">To-day a friend from Philadelphia has made me a half-hour call, with his four nice
                girls, one of them about your age, two a little older, &amp; one younger. He has
                four boys and four girls. First he takes the four boys out, &amp; then the four
                girls—I enjoyed their call—They were going off on a little
                excursion—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My brother &amp; sister are well as usual—My nieces are now here—have left school—they are grown, tall hearty
                girls—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tell Mont I want to see him—I often wished he was
                with me to see the sights, when I was in New York—It is very hot here
                to-day—I want to come down soon, probably next week, &amp; see you all &amp;
                see the new place—I will send word a day or two before, so Mont or you can
                come to the station for me. Love to you &amp; all, Ruthy dear. I shall come
                    soon.</p>
