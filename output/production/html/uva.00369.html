        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have look'd over the Emerson notes—read them all over
        once—am precluded from any thing more or giving any very deep or elaborate analysis of
        them, in connection with the Emerson question, (as my brain is in a state not allowing
        thought, argument or study)—but still I will give you my first impressions of your
        pages: </p>

      <p class="tei_p">In their totality, they produce a not agreeable notion of being written by one who has been
        largely grown &amp; ripened &amp; gristled by Emerson, but has at last become dissatisfied
        &amp; finnicky about him, &amp; would pitch into him, but cannot—perhaps dare
        not—and so keeps running around in a sort of circle of praises &amp; half praises,
        like a horse tied by a tether. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your Notes also seem to me (to be plain) a good deal too diffuse, &amp; too Emersony in
        themselves—I should select <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">about one third of the MS. as first rate</span>, (including the opening part)—My opinion is that you
        had perhaps better work it all over, &amp; leave out at least half—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">About the allusions to me, my off–hand thought is that my name might be brought in,
        in one or two places, as foil or suggestive comparison—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but my name
          only</span>, without any praises or comments, (only the silently inferred ones)—to my
        friends, &amp; circle, who know the relations &amp; history between me &amp; Emerson, the
        mere mention of the name itself, in that way, will be significant—(&amp; it might give
        pungency to the sentence)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have had a bad time the last two weeks—head &amp; belly—&amp; I almost wonder
        I stand it so well—for I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">do</span> stand it—I go out most every
        day, a little—John Swinton, from N. Y. has been to see
        me—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you &amp; 'Sula—</span>
