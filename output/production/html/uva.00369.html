        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have look'd over the Emerson notes<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—read them all over
        once—am precluded from any thing more or giving any very deep or elaborate analysis of
        them, in connection with the Emerson question, (as my brain is in a state not allowing
        thought, argument or study)—but still I will give you my first impressions of your
        pages: </p>

      <p class="tei_p">In their totality, they produce a not agreeable notion of being written by one who has been
        largely grown &amp; ripened &amp; gristled by Emerson, but has at last become dissatisfied
        &amp; finnicky about him, &amp; would pitch into him, but cannot—perhaps dare
        not—and so keeps running around in a sort of circle of praises &amp; half praises,
        like a horse tied by a tether. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your Notes also seem to me (to be plain) a good deal too diffuse, &amp; too Emersony in
        themselves—I should select <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">about one third of the MS. as first rate</span>, (including the opening part)—My opinion is that you
        had perhaps better work it all over, &amp; leave out at least half—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">About the allusions to me, my off–hand thought is that my name might be brought in,
        in one or two places, as foil or suggestive comparison—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but my name
          only</span>, without any praises or comments, (only the silently inferred ones)—to my
        friends, &amp; circle, who know the relations &amp; history between me &amp; Emerson, the
        mere mention of the name itself, in that way, will be significant—(&amp; it might give
        pungency to the sentence)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have had a bad time the last two weeks—head &amp; belly—&amp; I almost wonder
        I stand it so well—for I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">do</span> stand it—I go out most every
        day, a little—John Swinton<a href="#n0611" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0611">3</a>, from N. Y. has been to see
        me—</p>

                    journalist and friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the
                    Civil War. Swinton, managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                    Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman.
                    Whitman's correspondence with Swinton began on <a href="bos.00006">February
                        23, 1863</a>. Swinton's enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On <a href="loc.01955">September 25, 1868</a>, Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly
                    impressed with the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you.
                    I read this afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never
                    before read. I could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more
                    to me than all other books and poetry." On <a href="loc.01957">June 23,
                        1874</a>, Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter":
                    "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the
                    'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street,
                    Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something
                    that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me,
                    grown around me, and grown into me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
                    36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
                    for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the
                    weekly labor journal, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Swinton's Paper</span>. When this
                    publication folded, he returned to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. See Robert
