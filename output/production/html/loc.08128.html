            <p class="tei_p">By this morning mail arrived your two post cards of 21<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> and 22<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> and also "Truth"
                for 19<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst. for which latter many thanks I was going to write for it and am glad to have it without waiting.
                I like "Old Chants" well—exceedingly, indeed.—Walt, I cannot see this falling off that they speak of in your poetry—some of
                your late prose has not been to my mind up to your standard—but your verse has not fallen off—of course you do not write now
                as you did in the "Song of Myself" days—in power there has been since then a tremendous drop—but that
                drop occurred in the early '60—Since then you have held your own and today your verse has as great,

            <p class="tei_p">Stoddart's column is interesting and in good taste.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am real glad that you have had the doctor and more glad still that you seem 
                to take kindly to him—I hope now that you will let him keep coming and I am certain he will help you—that he thinks
                things fairly satisfactory with you is good and comforting.</p>
