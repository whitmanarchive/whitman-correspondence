            <p class="tei_p">I have just returned from a long tour in Germany &amp; France &amp; find a pamphlet of yours 
                awaiting me Sent I hope &amp; presume by you—I say <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I hope</span> for 
                there is no line accompanying it and yet I think it is your writing on the cover

                If you have sent it then am I not forgotten.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have often wished I may say Even longed to hear from you—a few a very few lines to tell 
                me of your well being a little of your doings and of your recollection (if it is not too much to 
                ask) of one who is always <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr:</span>​  sincere friend &amp; 
                lover &amp; who travelled many a mile to see &amp; speak with you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I even hoped against hope that you would brighten us perhaps in England this summer but it

      </span></span> and neither you, or word of you came, though 
                many a time and oft as steamer after steamer arrived I wondered, does he come or write.—Enough—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mark you; if to you I am indebted for the pamphlet I like it much. it strikes me as so simple 
                pure &amp; powerful, &amp; reminds me

                as so much of your work does of all that is sweet &amp; good &amp; noble in the world Somehow when 
                I read you or think of you, I feel once more the cool never to be forgotten breeze of a boundless 
                prairie; my lungs seem to open and I respire more easily I feel perhaps freer for the time &amp; 
                less material &amp; then again I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong &amp; tight &amp; for 
                eternity the great hand of a friend a simple good fellow a man

                who loves me &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the Consciousness of that I feel 
                never alone—never sad—&amp; Much more, I feel but to what purpose do I write thus—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will tell you a little of what I have seen but it must be very little as I only returned late last 
                night after a long journey &amp; find much to occupy me. Paris, the gay, the beautiful is no longer either. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.006_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01618.006_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.006_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                It is terribly sad &amp; horribly ugly. Great wounds as it were over the face of it—ruins at every 
                corner streets blackened with petroleum. Shop window after shop window in the most busy &amp; flourishing 
                quarters still smashed &amp; unmended patched up with paper houses torn by shells—and the people in 
                the streets &amp; on the boulevards 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.007_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01618.007_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.007_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                no longer the Parisians of old but a sadder may we hope a wiser people—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">So many thousands are in deep mourning that this gives as it were a funeral touch to it all.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then the Palace of St. Cloud is a skeleton, not a window not a bit of roof is left of it. The old Tuilleries 
                too look fearful—with their picturesque walls &amp; in the distance The grand almost sublime ruins of 
                the Hotel de Ville look reproachfully upon 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.008_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01618.008_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.008_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                you—to me Paris was very saddening—still more Metz &amp; Strasbourg which are alike what the French 
                call Abimé—literally razed Even unto the ground—the soldiers all that remain of them look small, 
                ill fed, ill clothed, and are I heard over drilled—In Strasbourg—Prussian band plays 
                magnificently Every day at a certain but as yet no one has been seen to stand &amp; listen to it—
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.009_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01618.009_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.009_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                hatred is no word for the feeling between them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Prussian soldiers are really splendid fellows I think you would very much like them, they are so manly &amp; 
                simple perhaps too warlike but that is of course the fault of their Education for their temperament is it seems 
                to me very domestic &amp; affectionate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Blind as Frenchmen 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.010_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01618.010_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01618.010_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                always are to their own faults Parisians appear to be dimly conscious that it was Paris much more than France that 
                forced the Emperor by its mad clamor to undertake the war which has ruined both the Emperor and Capital.</p>
