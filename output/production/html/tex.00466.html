            <p class="tei_p">Yours came this forenoon, &amp; was read &amp; reread, &amp; dispatched on the round
                to Kennedy, John Burroughs, &amp; Dr.
                    Bucke—all so anxious to get definite news from
                William. It somehow seems the most encouraging yet—God grant our dear friend
                may indeed get complete recovery—Write often as you can, dear friend. With me
                &amp; my affairs no great ripple—I am worldlily comfortable &amp; in good
                physical condition as usual of late—I went on to New York—was convoyed
                by my dear old Quaker friend R Pearsall Smith—had a
                success at the lecture 14th (netted $600 for my self—Andrew Carnegie gave $350 for his box)—had a stunning <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">reception</span>—I think 300 people, many ladies—that
                evn'g Westminster Hotel—newspapers friendly, everybody friendly even the
                authors—&amp; returned here Friday 4 p m train from N Y. in good
                order—Am going over to Phila: this p m to be sculp'd by St Gaudiens, the N Y
                sculptor who has come on, to do it—Signs of spring rather late, but
                here—I am call'd to dinner (baked shad)—</p>
