                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter day before yesterday—&amp; am sorry you are troubled with
                rheumatism—it must be quite bad—Do you have any one to do the rougher
                house-work? I hope you have. Mother, every thing is pretty much the same with
                me—I remain very well, go around a good deal in the open air—we have it
                pretty hot in the middle of the day, &amp; dusty—but the nights are
                beautiful—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I know the Mr. Simonson you saw at the post office—he has been a sort of Deputy
                post master a good many years—Notwithstanding what he says, the Brooklyn p. o.
                has a very bad name, &amp; a great many money letters sent there never get to their
                destination—but I should think by what you have said, that the carrier who
                brings your letters must be a good safe man—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We had the strangest procession here last Tuesday night, about 3000 darkeys, old
                &amp; young, men &amp; women—I saw them all—they turned out in honor of
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">their</span> victory in electing the Mayor, Mr. Bowen—the
                men were all armed with clubs or pistols—besides the procession in the street,
                there was a string went along the sidewalk in single file with bludgeons &amp;
                sticks, yelling &amp; gesticulating like madmen—it was quite comical, yet very
                disgusting &amp; alarming in some respects—They were very insolent, &amp;
                altogether it was a strange sight—they looked like so many wild brutes let
                loose—thousands of slaves from the Southern plantations have crowded up
                here—many are supported by the Gov't.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday I went up to the Presidents to see the reception of the Chinese
                Embassy—there were eight or nine Chinese, headed by our Mr. Burlingame, who is
                head of them all, (O'Connor knows him quite well)—you will see the speech made
                to them by the President, in the papers—I think it is first rate—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting awhile in the office—we are having a spell of hot oppressive
                weather—It is generally thought we clerks will get our extra
                compensation—but I wait to see whether Congress will pass it—if they do
                I will make you a present, mother dear—So you like the ticket, Grant &amp;
                    Colfax, do you, mother? Well, I do, too—Chase is
                cutting up, trying to get somebody to nominate him, &amp; doing his best to injure
                the Republican ticket—He is just the meanest &amp; biggest kind of a
                shyster—He tried the same game at Lincoln's second nomination—Mother, I
                send the Chicago News, No. 7—have you rec'd the six others all safe? I have
                    sent them all—</p>

                <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Monday forenoon, June 8</span>. Nothing special to write about this
                morning, mother. We had a thunder-shower last night &amp; very pleasant this
                morning—I was up to O'Connors as usual last evening to tea—they are all
                well. Well, I believe that is all—only to send you my love, mother
                dear—same to George—write all the domestic news, &amp; about George's
                work, &amp; the house.</p>
