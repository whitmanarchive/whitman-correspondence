                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter, including Han's, arrived, &amp; I was glad to hear that sis's penny had a safe journey—I was very glad to hear George had sold one of the houses—&amp; also to hear from Han.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, all the news I have to write about my affairs, is the same old thing—we have had another long spell of stormy weather here, rain, &amp; snow, &amp; mud—In the office, every thing as usual—I spend a good deal of the time there, nights &amp; Sundays—it is quiet &amp; agreeable—It is likely Surratt's trial will come on before long—I have become acquainted with St Marie, the man who discovered Surratt in Rome—it was quite curious, 
                &amp; I will tell you when I come home. He goes here by a false name—he is very unhappy, &amp; is in dread of assassination, 
                from Surratt's friends—He came to me for advice, &amp; wanted me to intercede for him with some 
                members of Congress, as he says the government is treating him very coldly, as if they didn't consider 
                he had done them any favor. I declined to mix up at all in the matter, in any way. 
                He talked a good deal, &amp; told me a good deal about Surratt. 
                It is quite an interesting story, &amp; I will tell you all about it when I come home.
            </p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">It was so stormy, the walking so dreadful, (half-melted snow,) that I didn't go to the hospital last Sunday. 
                I have rec'd another epistle from Heyde—one of his regular damned fool's letters—I never answer them, nor make any allusion to them—it was full of complaints
                    
                    
                —</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">To-day it is bright sunshiny weather—yesterday too—but rather cool—Congress is to adjourn this week—they have carried all their measures successfully over the President—I am writing this at my desk—the air is very clear, &amp; I can see a great distance over the 
                Potomac off into Virginia—the river is high &amp; muddy to-day—I hope this will find you feeling well, 
                &amp; free from rheumatism. Love to George &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat.
            </p>
