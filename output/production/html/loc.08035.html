                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    club that met monthly at different hotels and luxury steamers around New York
                    City from 1889 to about 1910. One observer writes that the Quaint Club is
                    "composed of journalists and artists who make a feature of stated dinners which
                    are enlivened with caricature and song" (Frederick G. Mather, "Club Life in
                    New-York City," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Memorial History of the City of
                        New-York</span>, ed. James Grant Wilson [New York: New-York History Company,
                    1893], 4:255). A newspaper account of these dinners suggests that they were
                    scenes of biting comedy, often at the guest of honor's expense: "Its habit is to
                    secure the wittiest and most eloquent speakers in the country and guy the wit
                    and eloquence out of them when they get on their feet. They are lucky if they
                    survive one of its dinners. Few persons really like this, but the process has
                    the same power as the candle flame exerts toward the moth" ("Fun for the Quaint
                    Club," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Sun</span>, [March 21, 1891], 9). Horace Trabuel
