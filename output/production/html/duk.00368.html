         <p class="tei_p">As you requested me to write you after leaving the Hospital. I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> will do so for the first time. My wishes are that this may find you enjoying good health and plenty of kind friends to associate with.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have not been over to Armory Square Hospital since leaveing itâ€”. But have been expecting to call there and also to see you The orders here are very strict  no one is allowed out side of Camp without a pass and the passes are scarse</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall manage to see you before I leave for the front if possible We are to get our horses in a day or so, and then be off to joine our Regiments</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The News are dull concerning the movements of the Army but for all that we expect to hear of a hard fought Battle before long. I think that we will be sent out as reenforcements so much the better</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now Uncle I hope you will not believe that I had or have forgoten you. I will write again when at the front &amp; perhaps have something more worth writing about. I will close by expecting to have a better opportunity of writing some thing else when you hear from me again My health is good at present</p>

                    Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in
                    Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
                    corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
                    1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the
                    correspondence was renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On
                    March 5, 1875, Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old
                    Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the
                    days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter,
                    on August 16, 1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for
                    California. Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection. He is
                    mentioned in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During the War</span> (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span>, 10 vols. [New
                    York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134). When Bucke wrote to Farwell after Walt
                    Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the back of a
                    circular," was extant (Miller). For Farwell's other correspondence with Whitman
