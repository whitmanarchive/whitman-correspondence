                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    Harleigh Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey, on March 30, 1892, in an elaborate
                    granite tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of Philadelphia built the
                    tomb, at a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs with
                    money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a
                    summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor,
                    Thomas Harned. For more information on the cemetery and Whitman's tomb, see See
