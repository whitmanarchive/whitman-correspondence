                    letter are drawn from an auction catalog put out by the American Art Association
                    for a sale on March 10–11, 1924. The location of this manuscript is
                    presently unknown. The letter was probably written in 1878 after the Gilchrists'
                    departure from Philadelphia in April. After their arrival in New York, at first
                    they took rooms in Brooklyn (see the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of
                        <a href="med.00680">December 12, 1878</a>), but, on December 29, when
                    Anne Gilchrist wrote to her daughter Beatrice, who was in Boston, she had just
                    moved to 112 Madison Avenue, New York City (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                    the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                    D.C.). This note may have been addressed to Jeannette Gilder, as Whitman wrote a
                    post card to her on this date (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Feinberg
                    Collection). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
