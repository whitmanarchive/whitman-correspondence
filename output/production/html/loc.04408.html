                the—presents you sent me: <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">viz</span> the two books—("Passage

                by him for a copy, as arranged with you).</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot tell you how much I prize them—especially the latter. Carlyle's
                heart was not stirred more deeply by the friendship and gifts of Goëthe than 
                mine is by yours—nor, indeed, I think, nearly so much</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have thought it a sufficient, and, indeed, a great and sacred privilege to write to you

                to shew you some slight beginnings, even here, of the immense influence 
                your work is destined to
                have, and of the deep personal love and reverence towards yourself, which must always accompany it,
                and which millions will yet share. And I have felt it a duty, as well as a privilege, to show my
                gratitude to you and to cheer you (so far as might be) by some expression of all this.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But I never dreamed of receiving such returns!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Fitly, indeed!, and with a full heart,
                may I "hang up your picture as that of the tenderest lover, the friend the lover's portrait, of
                whom his friend his lover is fondest"—It shall adorn my room as long as I live,—reminding
                me daily of you, of your work and life, of your great—benefactions to me personally through

                to how many besides!—and (not least) of the consecrating friendship with which you have crowned
                them, and of the tender, thoughtful courtesy and noble kindness which you have shewn 
                me. I trust it may also prove a daily incentive to emulation of your great qualities.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">For your goodness to me—like all the good gifts of life—carries with it its own deep
                obligations. And these I feel to be—to live as one worthy of

               your friendship, and to help on, so far as I can, your influence and work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It awakens in me an old purpose, which circumstances have for the last few years thwarted and 
            almost crushed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Five years ago (last January) my mother died. (You, too, know well what that means!—though I
                doubt if even you can have sounded so deeply—as many exceptionally harmful

                circumstances led me to sound—the unfathomable depths of a mothers tender, self-sacrificing
                love.—And the circumstances of her death, beautiful &amp; sacred, affected me infinitely more,
                and were a far deeper revelation to my soul than any literature—even yours.) In the revision
                of my purposes and aims that followed, one fixed project with me was to contribute to current literature
                an account of your work that should include one or two things that have not yet been said—at
                any rate, not with sufficient

               clearness and emphasis. But many untoward circumstances (partly resulting in &amp; including
               mental and nervous break down &amp; exhaustion) have prevented me from attempting this, and I see
               no prospect now of carrying out my plan for a long time to come.—But I trust that the time
               <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">will</span> come,—when, perhaps, I shall be all the better fitted for it
               by the long delay.—At any rate "my purpose holds," and as the old painter (quoted by
