                    contractor and a publisher in London. His publishing firm, Walter Scott, was
                    based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and it was the imprint under which a
                    number of Whitman's books appeared in England. Walter Scott's managing editor
                    was bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major
                    promoters in England—worked with the firm. Rhys included a volume of
                    Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
                    prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. Walter Scott also
                    published Whitman's 1886 English edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> and the English editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days in
                        America</span> (1887) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas, and Other
                        Papers</span> (1888). </span></span> [<a href="#r4147">back</a>]</li></ul>
