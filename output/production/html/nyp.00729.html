            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have word occasionally from you and it gives me great pleasure to know you are so
                comfortable. I get a card from Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">2</a> semi-occasionally. He
                seems to be very busy. I passed a pleasant evening with Mrs. Louise Chandler
                Moulton<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> the present week, and we had some considerable talk
                of you. She is an appreciative admirer of your work and prizes the chat she had with
                you last year. She writes a literary letter to the Herald each Sunday and gets in a
                telling touch once in a while on your work. She is a very charming and able woman.
                Your stalwart supporter. Judge Chamberlain,<a href="#n3145" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3145">4</a> of the Public
                Library, I see frequently: a very thoughtful and fearlessly outspoken man. He does
                some valuable historical lecturing and often says some inspiringly good things about
                our artificiality in poetry and the drama. I wonder if it ever occurred to you that
                our novel and drama is now slowly changing base, coming round to the "realization of
                the real." The whole outlook to me is full of hope. I think I see in what our
                aristocratic friends are pleased to call "vulgarity in fiction and the drama" the
                sure sign of the native indigenous literature we have waited for. If I should ever
                get to see you I should take pleasure in enlarging upon this. It forms the staple
                for a number of my lectures on the literature of Democracy.</p>

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    Moulton (1835–1908) was an American poet and critic who published several

                    him in Camden on April 23, 1888; she wrote of their meeting in her article,

                    she had words of praise for Whitman and his work, Whitman said of her, "I can't
                    endure her effusiveness: I like, respect her: but her dear this and dear that

                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
