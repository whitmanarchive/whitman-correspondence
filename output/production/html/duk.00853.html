            <p class="tei_p">Very hot to-day—now two weeks of it &amp; I am pulled down by it
                badly—feel it to-day worse than yet—have had a few mouthfuls of dinner,
                &amp; am sitting here in my big chair—after reading your letter &amp;
                O'C[onnor]'s to you—H[erbert] G[ilchrist] is here painting, &amp; Morse sculping—I enclose my last
                little piece—a slip copy—a N Y newspaper syndicate (S S McClure, Tribune
                Building) vehemently solicited, &amp; gave me $25 (far more than it is
                worth)—Then I have sent a three line piece "Twilight" ($10) to the
                    "Century" wh' they accepted &amp; paid
                    for—Hartman has been in Phila ten days, but
                returns to B[oston]—what do you think of him &amp; of his projected
                "Society"—As I close every thing is faint &amp; still with the heat—</p>
