                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman.</span>
            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 11 Jan.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> received. It is a bother about that
                draft—as I think probably it has been cashed already, and that you won't get
                the money.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> However, please send a line saying what
                happens. The original was posted about the 25th May last (I may have a note of exact
                date somewhere, but am away from home just now). I got no answer from you, but news
                came about that time that you were much out of sorts, and then later appeared a
                paragraph in the papers from you saying you had been ill and thanking friends for
                birthday letters remaining unanswered—so I supposed it was all right. If the
                original letter has merely been lost, the duplicate draft will of course be cashed:
                but if it has been, as I guess, intercepted, there is no practical remedy. I am
                almost certain that I registered the letter, which perhaps is an unwise thing to do
                in these cases, as it's like showing one's hand—and I may have the p.o.
                receipt for the letter at home, but of that I am not sure. Anyhow, let me know by
                p.c. how matters stand, but don't worry about it—as the letter (if necessary)
                would have to be traced from this end. The sum in question was from the Miss
                Fords,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> R.D. Roberts,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> W.

                myself:—as a little birthday remembrance—and we shall only be sorry at
                your receipt of it having been so delayed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I saw Ernest Rhys<a href="#n4152" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4152">7</a> a day or two back in London—seems pretty
                well—told me a good bit about you. I am glad from this present letter that you
                seem a bit better, Walt. Shall be glad to see the 900-pounder edition!<a href="#n4188" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4188">8</a>

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
