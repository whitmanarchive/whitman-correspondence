            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 7th rec'd with R[hys]'s card. Tr[anscript] not rec'd—A good letter
                from E[rnest] R[hys] to-day—J[ohn] N[ewton]
                    J[ohnson] is certainly crazy—a cross between Zdenko
                (in Consuelo) &amp; something more intellectual &amp; infernal—Very hot
                weather here, continued—I am feeling it badly—yet not so badly as you
                might fancy—I am careful, &amp; Mrs Davis is very good and cute—As I
                write it is clouded over &amp; begins to rain—H[erbert] G[ilchrist] is still
                here painting—Morse here—</p>
