            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I wrote to you a long time ago and received one letter from you but when I wrote again I received no answer and supposed you had not received my letter and I thought I would write you a few lines again and see if you had not forgotten me. I would try to make myself one of your correspondents for I would really like to hear from you very much for I formed an attachment for you during my short stay in washington (and at the hospital) that I would like to perpetuate it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I do not know your present address but shall address this the same as I did the last one I wrote to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My Friend Hamilton started for Leavenworth Kansas last week to see his Brother, who has been jammed up on the Rail Road, and had his leg amputated.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will not weary you with a very long letter this time but will wait till I get an answer to this and then I will try to do better.</p>

               <span class="tei_salute">I am as every your sincere friend</span>
