                    for Miss Belghannie, describing her as a devoted English admirer of Whitman's,
                    preceded her Thursday, May 14, 1891, visit to Whitman's home on Mickle Street.
                    According to Horace Traubel's account, Miss Belghannie was familiar with several
                    of Whitman's friends in England, including the family of political activist Mary
                    Whitall Costelloe Smith, the feminist writer Isabella Ford and her sister
                    Elizabeth, and Edward Carpenter, a writer and Whitman disciple. Whitman "asked
                    [Miss Belghannie] what she was to speak about down at the church? And she told
                    him—the forming of wage-women in union. He did not appear to be greatly
                    struck with the idea, yet would say, 'It is well to go fishing—to
                    fish—to see if anything is to be caught.' This led to some considerable
                    talk—she of 'the good time coming' and admonishing him not to go back on
                    'Leaves of Grass'—and he saying or asking, 'Don't you think all this
                    inevitable?—that it is because it must be—that in the swinging
                    orbital movement of planets, all that is becomes the right and the just,' etc."

                    pamphlet in 1871. It is comprised of three essays Whitman had planned to
                    publish in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> magazine. Two of these essays
                    appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>: "Democracy" was published in the
                    December 1867 issue and "Personalism" in the May 1868 issue. Whitman submitted
                    the third essay, "Orbic Literature," to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>, but
                    it was not published in the magazine. For more information on this work, see
