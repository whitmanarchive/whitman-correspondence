                mutton-broth &amp; dry biscuit—&amp; am sitting here by the stove—sharp
                cold &amp; clear to day—Yours of 17th came this mn'g—so the books
                arrived at last—&amp; you are contented &amp; pleas'd—&amp; the trilogy
                holds together &amp; fuses, tho' various &amp; paradoxical &amp; rapidly twittering,
                (probably like Dante's filmy ghosts, rushing by with mere gibberish)—yes it is
                mainly all <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">autobiographic</span> environ'd with my time &amp; deeply
                incarnated &amp; tinged with it, &amp; the moral begetting of it (I hope)—The
                first time soon write whether you get every thing letters &amp; papers—I have
                written now every day the last five days &amp; sent budgets of papers or
                magazines—wrote a line to Mrs. O'Connor last
                evn'g—If I hear any thing I will forward you—I am sitting up all day,
                yesterday &amp; this—I believe I told you the bladder trouble appears to have
                subsided—</p>

                    cream—McKay has out an ed'n with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">annex, Sands at Seventy</span>. I have one—it goes all
                right—sells the same $2—the postage on the big book is 38cts—I put
                four 10ct stamps—I sent one by p o to-day—(the last page contains "Old
                Age's Lambent Peaks")—I enclose two letters—one from Logan Smith—one from Algiers, Africa—Love to you all &amp; God bless you—</p>
