            <p class="tei_p">Yours of Ap: 20 just rec'd &amp; welcomed. Write
                oftener—The Staffords &amp; I remember you with
                greatest affection &amp; esteem—I also with deepest gratitude—I am still
                here in the same little old house—of course gradually sinking &amp;
                dissolving—Harry S[tafford] had a surgical operation on
                his throat—it seems to have been properly done, &amp; the cut is
                healing—He is at Marlton, New Jersey, married, has a child—I send you
                some papers—always best love—</p>
