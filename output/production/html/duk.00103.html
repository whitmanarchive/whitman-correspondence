            <p class="tei_p">I have always felt that you were a relative of mine, and on the strength of that, am
                going to ask for your autograph. My mother was a Whitman of Bangor, has relations in
                Mass. and N.J. by that name, and the late Judge Whitman<a href="#n7057" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7057">2</a> of Portland was also a
                relative. Do you belong to that family of Whitmans.</p>

                    was a State Representative of both Massachusetts and Maine. For nearly thirty
                    years, Ezekiel Whitman was a judge, ultimately serving as Chief Justice of the
                    Maine Supreme Court. Though there is not yet enough information on how Mrs. J.
                    S. Harris is related to Walt Whitman, Ezekiel Whitman's relation to the poet is
                    very distant, with a shared sixteenth century ancestor, Abijah Whitman
                    (1560–1626), making him Walt's sixth cousin, once removed. For more
                    information on Ezekiel Whitman, see "Whitman, Ezekial," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Biographical Encyclopedia of Maine of the Nineteenth Century</span> (Boston:
                    Metropolitan Publishing &amp; Engraving Company, 1885), 347–351. An avid
                    genealogist, Ezekiel Whitman published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoir of John Whitman
                        and His Descendants</span> in 1832, that traced his genealogy through Abijah
                    Whitman's son John, who came to the American Colonies in 1635 and settled in
                    Weymouth, Massachusetts. For Whitman's account of his ancestry, including Abijah
                    and his sons, see Whitman's "Genealogy—Van Velsor and Whitman," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days and Collect</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
