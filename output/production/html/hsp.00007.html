            <p class="tei_p">Last Spring I happened upon a nest of poets at Avignon—Provençal poets—successors 
                of the old troubadours—among them <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg">Mssr</span> 
                Charles Bonaparte Wyse, a descendant of Lucien Bonaparte 
                &amp; the son of an Irishman. He went to the South of France, from Ireland, some 25 years ago &amp; was so 
                charmed with the poets there that he learned the Provençal language &amp; became one

                of them. He spends a part of every year there. He is a gentleman, a scholar, &amp; a poet; also a good
                judge of poetry. Well, he is one of your warmest friends &amp; appreciators—and has sent by me all
                sorts of messages to you. As I am not to return till the Spring I send them by mail. Last April we dined 
                with him at the inn of "La Chevelure d'Or," at the ancient, ruined &amp; almost deserted city of Les Baux, 
                In the top of a mountain near Arles. This inn, by the way, was named by Mr. Wyse after

            a magnificent head of golden hair found in an old tomb at Les Baux, which he has made the subject of a 
            Provençal poem, &amp; which was in the possesion of the landlord. At this dinner Mr. Wyse proposed, 
            &amp; we all drank, standing, the health of Walt Whitman.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have just received a letter from my friend in which he says:</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">"I enclose you my promised Provençal translation of two of the sweetest bits of Manahatta's poetry. 
                I have not attempted his poetic prose, which is not to be imitated, but

                have had the audacity to compress, Procrustes-<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wise</span>,
                his touching lines into the stocks of my verse. Do, I beg of you, do me the great favor to present them to
                him, in my name, when next you see him. Insignificant as is the attention, it is at any rate a straw which
                will show which way the wind blows. If ever I go to America, I assure you that one of my first visits will
                be to this most sympathetic of poets, for whose large &amp; lofty nature my admiration is merged into
