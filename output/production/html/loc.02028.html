            <p class="tei_p">You will see by the enclosed card that I have returned to the Internal Revenue
                service. I regretted to leave Los Angeles and the practice of law, but times got
                very hard there, and although I had some important cases and good fees on prospect I
                was unable to realize the cash proceeds; so I applied and got my present
                position—same that I held before.—I hope to resume practice in this
                state, some time in the future, when I have paid my debts and saved a little
                money.—I am now a citizen of California and hope to always remain such. I
                should not be contented to settle down in the East, again, I think.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The death of William O'Connor<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">2</a> though long anticipated, was a
                great shock when the news came.—What a wealth of intellectual enthusiasm and
                power was there extinguished, if it could be so:<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> but I don't believe he or any of us
                can go out like a childs carlacue in the night.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> I have
                faith to believe that we shall all meet again on the other side of Jordan, &amp; if

                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
