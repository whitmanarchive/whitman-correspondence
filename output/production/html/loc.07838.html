                suppose (have this tenacious grip though)—was out last Sunday—was
                propell'd in the wheel chair—to my Camden friends Mr. and Mrs. T B Harned who treated me to a splendid meal of oysters &amp;
                champagne—to wh' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">abstemious me</span> did fullest justice (I
                think the best ch: I ever drank)—I am writing a little annex (the 2d) to L of

                (on a little wooded slope in Harleigh Cemetery here)—</p>
