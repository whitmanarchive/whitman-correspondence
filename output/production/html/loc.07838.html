                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    tomb, at a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs with
                    money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a
