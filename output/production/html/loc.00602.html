                    Second U. S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.00596">September 17</a>, from the U. S. General Hospital at
                    Carlisle, Pennsylvania, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry." He
                    expected, he explained on <a href="loc.00598">September 28</a>, to rejoin
                    his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote on October
                    13. He wrote on <a href="loc.00601">December 16</a>, from Culpepper,
                    Virginia, that he was doing provost duty, and on <a href="loc.00602">February 28</a>, 1864, he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia,
                    where "the duty is verry hard." He was wounded again on June 11, so his parents
                    reported to Whitman (August 29), was transported to Washington, and went home on
                    furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30</a>, he wrote to Whitman: "I would like to
                    see you verry much, I have drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener
                    still." He expected to leave the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered
                    out, and on <a href="loc.00882">October 22</a> he wrote to Whitman from
                    Queensbury, New York. When his parents communicated with Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.00605">January 26, 1865</a>, Bethuel was well enough to
                    perform tasks on the farm. (These letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection.) Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten years
                    later; see Walt Whitman to Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2: 318–319). </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
