                    Gray was a captain in the Twentieth New York Infantry and later held the same
                    rank in the Assistant Adjutant General's Volunteers. He became a major on
                    January 4, 1865, and resigned on December 6 of the same year; see Francis B.
                    Heitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Historical Register and Dictionary of the United
                        States Army</span>, 2 vols. (Washington D.C.: Government Publications Office,
                    1903). In 1862 he fought in the battle at Antietam, and at Charles Pfaff's beer
                    cellar located in lower Manhattan, he gave Whitman "a fearful account of the
                    battlefield at Â½ past 9 the night following the engagement." (For discussion of
                    Whitman's activity at Pfaff's, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/walt_whitman/index.html#bohemian">The Bohemian Years</a>.") In 1864, according to one of Whitman's
                    notebooks (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
                    Congress, Notebook #103), Gray was stationed at New Orleans. He graduated from
                    the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York in 1871, and briefly
                    practiced medicine with his father in New York. Whitman referred to him during
                    this period in a notebook (The Library of Congress, Notebook #109). Later he
                    practiced in Paris, Nice, and Geneva. He died of Bright's disease at St. Clair
                    Springs, Michigan, on April 18, 1891; obituaries appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
