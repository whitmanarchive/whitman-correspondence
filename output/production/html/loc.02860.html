                That of myself done in 1850 is a copy of a daguerrotype.
                The recent one was taken just a week or so before I broke down in my long illness
                &amp; when I was struggling against a terrible sense of inward prostration, so it
                has not my natural expression, but I think you will like to have it rather than
                none, &amp; the weather here is too gloomy for there to be any chance of a good one
                if I were to try again—Your few words lifted a heavy weight off me. Very few
                they are, dear friend: but knowing that I may give to every word you speak its

                you &amp; were welcome to you,—but restless, anxious impatient, looking so
                wistfully towards the letters each morning—above all longing, longing so for
                you to come—to come &amp; see if you feel happy beside me: no more this painful 
                struggle to put myself into words; but to let what I am &amp; all my life speak to 
                you. Only so can you judge whether I am indeed the woman capable of rising to the full

                house for us in London where rents are so high. And I have succeeded better than I 
                anticipated for we find this a comfortable dear little home—small indeed but 
                not so small as to interfere with health or comfort &amp; at rent that I may safely 
                undertake. My Husband<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">5</a> was taken from us too young to be 
                able to have made any provision for his children. I have a little of my own—about

                anything but a pleasure of this &amp; as long as she was able to see to her own affairs, 
                was such a capital manager that she used to spare me about £150 out of an income of 
                £350. But now though she retains her faculties in a wonderful degree for her years

                hardship, but quite the contrary to have to spend a good deal of time &amp; pains in 
                domestic management. And then just to help me through at the right moment dear Per 
                obtained in November a good opening in some large copper &amp; iron mining &amp; smelting 
                works in South Wales at a salary upon which he can comfortably live

                a turn in education, for hitherto they have had hardly any teaching but mine. And I chose

                His bent is so unmistakably strong. It was well I have had to be so busy this autumn &amp; 
                winter, dear Walt, for I suffered keenly, sometimes overwhelmingly, through the delay in my

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
