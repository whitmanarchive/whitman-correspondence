                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

                    not published until 1891, William D. O'Connor's story appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic Monthly</span> in two installments: Part 1, vol.
                    67, no. 402, April 1891, pp. 433–454; Part 2, vol. 67, no. 403, May 1891,
                    pp. 577–599. The story also appeared in the collection <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Three Tales: The Ghost, The Brazen Android, The Carpenter</span> (Boston:
                    Houghton, Mifflin, 1891), for which Whitman wrote the Preface (which he later
                    included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay,
                    1891], 51–53). In it, he describes his relationship with O'Connor, writing
                    that "he was a gallant, handsome, gay-hearted, fine-voiced, glowing-eyed man"
                    (iii). Whitman goes on to praise O'Connor's abolitionism, his talents as a
                    literary critic and writer of fiction, and his "special defenses" of
                    controversial literary figures, among whom Whitman includes himself. Although
                    not explicitly mentioned, Whitman no doubt had in mind O'Connor's "vindication"
                    of him in "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet</a>" (1866). For more on O'Connor's story, see Brooks
