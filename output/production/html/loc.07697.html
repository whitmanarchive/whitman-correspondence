                Another perfect sunny day—plenty warm enough—am feeling 
                middling fair—toast, a rare fried egg, &amp; a cup of tea, for breakfast
                (demolished all)—the vibrating voices of the loud-crying peddlers in the streets, 
                quite a musical study, some of them have wonderfully fine organs as they 
                peal and drawl them along &amp; it is fine, healthy, strengthening, expanding,
                blood-circulating &amp; blood-clarifying exercising, calling loudly out in 
                the open air this way, throwing the voices out freely, slowly walking along—I almost envy them, 
                (with their cabbages, fish or what not, &amp; their old 
                vehicles &amp; nags.)

                Dick Flynn &amp; Ed are over in Phila—I sent Ed for the pictures again—I 
                hope y'rs will come right—Dick is very quiet—we all like him here—he 
                has left &amp; will get there before this—I sent off the little piece to 
                Harper's last evn'g—written in an hour—it is to accompany a fine engraving,
                "the valley of the shadow of Death"—I ask $25—(of course it may 
                not suit them—we will see)—

                Herbert Gil: was here last evn'g. He is very good company—
                Horace was here—the dinner book will be soon out now—

                time—give him my best regards &amp; wishes—rather warmish weather
                (fine) here—I am middling fairly—have been writing this forenoon—
                Harper's has accepted the little piece &amp; sent the pay &amp; proof (not to be
                printed, I fancy, soon)—also just rec'd f'm <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Century</span> a little eight line 
                poemet proof, "My 71st Year" (I believe for Nov.)—I enclose Pearsall
                Smith's good letter rec'd last evn'g—they have evidently great inward
                intestinal agitation &amp; unsettledness in Great Britain, (we too here in 
                America, but our belly is so large)—then the unsettledness on the Continent
                too—as dear Mrs G. said we are all "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">going somewhere</span>"
                indeed—I suppose the dyspeptic Carlyle would say "Yes, to hell"—But 
                per contra old black Sojourner Truth was always saying "God reigns yet I 
                tell you"—
