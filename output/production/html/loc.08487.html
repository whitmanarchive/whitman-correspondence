                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Here, Whitman considers including in an appendix  
                    Gabriel Sarrazin's essay "Poetes modernes de l'Amerique, Walt Whitman," which appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">La Nouvelle Revue</span>, 52 (May 1, 1888), 164–184. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.04293_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.04293_n3"><span>Whitman referred to his

In Whitman's <a href="unc.00013">July
                        1888</a> letter to Myrick, he asked the printer to modify the placement of
                    poems in relation to a note. The note reads, in its entirety, "The two songs on
                    this page are eked out during an afternoon, June, 1888, in my seventieth year,
                    at a critical spell of illness. Of course no reader and probably no human being
                    at any time will ever have such phases of emotional and solemn action as these
                    involve to me. I feel in them an end and close of all" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
