            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The bearer, my friend, Mr. Shambaugh, was showing me a letter he has received, (he is on a Committee of Sold. &amp; Sail. Union League)â€”I think it ought to be published in full. You make a brief introduction to it &amp; let it go in a Sunday Chronicle. Let him have a proof when it is set up, to bring to me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours &amp;c</p>
