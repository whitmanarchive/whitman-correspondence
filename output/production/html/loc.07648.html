            <p class="tei_p">Pleasant cool, calm sunny weather—a rain quite hard, &amp; early this
                morning—I mustn't shout till I am well out of the woods but I feel perceptibly
                better—took a quite elaborate wash (bath) in a way that I like—helping
                myself leisurely—ab't two hours ago—&amp; handled myself decidedly better
                than five days ago—a sort of nibble <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of strength</span>—Yours of 26th rec'd—welcomed &amp; cheering—I have
                told you ab't the facts of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: Boughs</span>—I have just read the revised proof of "Elias
                Hicks"—when ready, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">publication</span> of N B may wait
                quite a long while, for reasons.</p>

            <p class="tei_p"> My opine is that our dear O'Connor is better—jaunting at present for the
                time an easier road on plateau land, like—(no doubt sufferings and
                botherations, plenty—but no one but a sick man—seriously
                sick—realizes the let up of some of the heaviest burdens)—O'C (do you
                know?) is writing a defence &amp; essay, generally, on the Donnelly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Crypto</span>[<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">gram</span>]—(I predict that it will be better than
                the C itself)—Ed Stafford has just call'd with some apples &amp; a
                chicken—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Have had my dinner, stew'd chicken &amp; rice pudding—have not left my room
                yet, but shall get down a few minutes to-morrow or next day—Spirits
                good—A letter from Logan Smith to-day—he is a collegian &amp; revels in
                it—</p>
