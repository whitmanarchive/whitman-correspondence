                    several post cards to Harry after he went to Canada, probably the fragment
                    reproduced here was sent at this time, since December 8 fell on Saturday in
                    1883. In a letter to Whitman from Canada on <a href="loc.03915">November
                        28</a>, Harry complained of his work as "turnkey" in Bucke's asylum, asked
                    for letters of recommendation, and concluded: "Your boy is away among strangers
                    and a good long letter from his dear friend will do him good." On <a href="loc.03916">December 17</a> Harry asserted: "I am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">determined</span> to make a hit somewhere and dont forget it.
                    I havent had a blue spell yet and think I can get along without any . . . With
                    lots of love and a good old time kiss I am ever your boy Harry." According to a
                    letter to his father on January 12, 1884, Harry was reading Haeckel and Darwin,
                    but was not satisfied with his position at the hospital: "The rules of the
                    Asylum are absurdly strict and of a military form." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
