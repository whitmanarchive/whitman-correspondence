            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Although I know Mr Lane<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> intends to write you to-day and send you a little money yet I thought I would jot you a note. My main object is to ask you if you can possibly hear anything of Lane's nephew (or boy as he calls him) as he has always been with him and Lane loves him like a son)  He belongs to the 20th Conn. and was in the 12th Army Corps under Gen Birney<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>  The letter of his Company I forget but think it was K. Lane is quite cast down about him, mostly from not hearing from him at all. The boys name is "Horace G. Tarr."<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, if you should by any chance or inquiry come across him or any news from him wont you please write Lane for I feel real sorry to see him so cast down. I see by some of the papers that quite a number of the 20th Conn. are at Washington in hospital</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel thankful indeed that George did not have to go through the dangers of this battle although we know not what is in store for him where he is.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I do so hope he will be spared to us and that he will come home without ever being injired.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Everything is moving the same as usual at home  of course we all feel pretty well down-hearted at the news but then we try to look on it in the most favorable light. God only knows what will be the next. I had certainly made up my mind that we should meet with partial success certainly, but it seems otherwise<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you are overcrowded with work just now  I cannot see Walt how you can stand it. I am sure that I could never get used to all the scenes of pain and horror that you have to witness  Tis well though that you can do so, for I know that you are doing a great deal of good.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you do not have much time to write home  We do not hear from you but seldom now. I suppose however that as long as we dont hear, everything is going as usual with you. We have not heard from either Han or George since I last wrote you  I am getting along first rate just now, make quite a little money and every thing goes well  Mother and Mat and Sis and all are well and send love. Write me Walt</p>

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money from his employees and
                    friends to give to Walt's hospital efforts during the Civil War. In his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00884">May 27, 1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month.
                    Similarly, Lane sent dollar contributions from six individuals on <a href="loc.00411">May 2, 1863</a>. In an unpublished manuscript in the
                    Berg Collection, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
                    quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
                    Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
                    there.)" Lane also assisted Whitman in other ways. He was so solicitous of
                    Whitman's personal welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>,
                    he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00412_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00412_n2"><span>Jeff seems to be in
                    error here. Major General David Bell Birney (1825–64) commanded divisions
                    at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, both places where the Twentieth Connecticut
                    Volunteers fought, but he never commanded in the Twelfth Army Corps. At this
                    time he commanded the First Division, Third Army Corps, Army of the Potomac,
                    while the Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers was in the Twelfth Army Corps, Second
                    Brigade, First Division, under the command of Colonel Samuel Ross

                    he was not injured. Evidently Tarr became a lifelong friend of Jeff and Walt
                    Whitman (see Jeff's letter to Walt dated <a href="yal.00088">11 September

                    11,000 men—about as many as Hooker lost—and Stonewall Jackson, Lee's
