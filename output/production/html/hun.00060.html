            <p class="tei_p">Your card of 2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> came to hand last evening. That you are feeling even "middling" well
                and that you are in a condition to be "sort of busy" is good news. Putting
                    Dick's account of you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">any​ </span><span class="tei_corr">and​
        
      </span></span> your own together I conclude that you are really wonderfull well
                "considering." You must be quite a little better than you were this time last year
                and I do not now see why you should not still gain. Begins to look here as if
                something might be done very shortly in the way of getting the meter started. We are all well and there is no news since I wrote
                last</p>
