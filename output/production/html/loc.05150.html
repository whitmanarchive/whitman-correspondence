                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been from home for a week attending a murder trial near Montreal so your note
                of 13<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span></span> lay waiting for me,
                got home day before yesterday and have gone over R's translation carefully, it is
                excellent, very literal, language very simple (as it should be) and reads (in the
                German) I should say fully as well as in the English. He has taken one liberty and
                only one—in English the last line reads
                <span class="inline_quote">"And may be just as much as the
                seasons."</span>
                This line he translates
                <span class="inline_quote">"Und sein was die Jahreszeiten sind."</span>
                Literally
            <span class="inline_quote">"And may be that which the seasons are."</span> 
                This change, although a
                little bold, does not strike me as a bad one, though I do not see why he did not
                read
                <span class="inline_quote">"Und sein so Viel als die Jahreszeiten sind."
                    "And may be as much as
                the seasons are."</span> 
                However there is no doubt the translation is good and there
                may be (and doubtless is) a good reason for his reading of the last line. I am not a
                good enough German scholar to appreciate very fine shades of meaning or of language.
                I wish to goodness R. w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span></span> hurry
                up and give us a vol. of L. of G. in German, I should like immensely to see it in
                that dress. I wish you would speak to M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span></span>Kay about the circulars he
                was to print for me in re my vol. "W. W." (he told me you had consented to write 
                said circular). I am constantly getting letters asking me about the book and a
                circular would be a better &amp; more convenient answer than a letter. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">N. B.</span> "Leaves of Grass" "Specimen Days &amp; Collect" and
                "Man's Moral Nature" should all be mentioned in circular—also the English
                publishers of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">each</span> of these books should be specified.
                    <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_atLeast_1 tei_gap_unit_chars">[cut away]</span> I wonder
                whether M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span></span>Kay has an English
                house yet for "W. W."? I wish you would have this circular got out and at least 500
                copies sent me as soon as possible. We are all well here, I am up to my eyes in
                work, have to write my annual report in the next two weeks</p>
