                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been from home for a week attending a murder trial near Montreal so your note
                of 13<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span></span> lay waiting for me,
                got home day before yesterday and have gone over R's translation<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> carefully, it is
                excellent, very literal, language very simple (as it should be) and reads (in the
                German) I should say fully as well as in the English. He has taken one liberty and
                only one—in English the last line reads
                <span class="inline_quote">"And may be just as much as the
                seasons."</span>
                This line he translates
                <span class="inline_quote">"Und sein was die Jahreszeiten sind."</span>
                Literally
            <span class="inline_quote">"And may be that which the seasons are."</span> 
                This change, although a
                little bold, does not strike me as a bad one, though I do not see why he did not
                read
                <span class="inline_quote">"Und sein so Viel als die Jahreszeiten sind."
                    "And may be as much as
                the seasons are."</span> 
                However there is no doubt the translation is good and there
                may be (and doubtless is) a good reason for his reading of the last line. I am not a
                good enough German scholar to appreciate very fine shades of meaning or of language.
                I wish to goodness R. w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span></span> hurry
                up and give us a vol. of L. of G. in German, I should like immensely to see it in
                that dress. I wish you would speak to M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span></span>Kay about the circulars he
                was to print for me in re my vol. "W. W." (he told me you had consented to write 
                said circular).<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> I am constantly getting letters asking me about the book and a
                circular would be a better &amp; more convenient answer than a letter. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">N. B.</span> "Leaves of Grass" "Specimen Days &amp; Collect" and
                "Man's Moral Nature" should all be mentioned in circular—also the English
                publishers of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">each</span> of these books should be specified.

                whether M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span></span>Kay has an English
                house yet for "W. W."? I wish you would have this circular got out and at least 500
                copies sent me as soon as possible. We are all well here, I am up to my eyes in
                work, have to write my annual report in the next two weeks</p>
