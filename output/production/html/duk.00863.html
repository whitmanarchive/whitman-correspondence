            <p class="tei_p">I express'd the plaster head to you last evening pre-paid,
                address'd to you, care of Sylvester Baxter, Herald office, 255
                Washington st. Boston—it is in a stout rather heavy box—I myself like
                the head muchly—it is what we call the 2d head—Morse made one, the 1st, with more brooding repose &amp;
                dignity, more of the antique spirit &amp;c. wh' many like best—it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">is</span> good, &amp; attractive but tho' I like the 1st decidedly I
                am quite clear <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this</span> is the typical one, modern, reaching out,
                looking ahead, democratic, more touch of animation (perhaps unsettledness) &amp;c.
                &amp;c.—not intended to be polished off—left purposely a little in the
                rough—</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you rec'd my cards—You and S B think over what I say ab't giving the
                head to some Boston Art Institution or (if you prefer) other depositary,
                    appropriate.<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">You &amp; he have absolute power to dispose of it
                    in that way</span>—It ought to be ready for you there at the Herald office,
                Friday or Saturday morning—I also sent you by mail to Belmont the Cox
                    photo you requested—hope you will write me
                Tuesday (or Wednesday) ab't all, the meeting &amp;c. details—I am ab't as usual, health &amp;c—pretty
                dull &amp; heavy—M D Conway has been to see
                me—No word from O'C[onnor]. Morse is here. I expect to
                see Ernest Rhys soon. I get word from Dr B[ucke] often. Sunshiny out to-day—I think of going forth with
                horse &amp; rig after dinner—God bless you and wife—</p>
