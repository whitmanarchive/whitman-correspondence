            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs of 11th rec'd—p o order rec'd &amp; 
                thank you—Sent the little L of G (pocket b'k 
                ed'n) three or four days since—possibly I may have made the mistake of directing it to Dr 
                J[ohnston]—(hope I have not also made the mistake of writing y'r or his name in it—cannot now 
                remember distinctly)—but at any rate you must have rec'd it by this time—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The little "new volume" to be put out by me will be only a further annex (the 2d 
                one) to L of G.—fixing the bits of the 
                last year and a half in book shape—will send you word of it &amp; probably the sheets themselves—tell Dr J. the photos 
                (of myself &amp; Frank Warren Fritzinger, my friend &amp; gillie) are rec'd &amp; valued both by me &amp; 
                Warry. Cooler weather here, but I get out in wheel 
                chair a little—Keep as well as usual—enclose 
                a printed slip (a 2d one, give to Dr J)—Respects to F R C Hutton &amp; all the friends</p>
