        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of yesterday came this morning. Yours of 5th came safe—Sunday night late, 
          (on returning from spending the evening, so you see I gad about <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">some</span>—)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I found it waiting for me, &amp; read it all through. Both letters are welcome. 
          Thank you particularly for the slip from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nation</span>,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> which I had not seen nor heard of. Nelly, I looked some five or six weeks ago 
        for Mrs. Banfield's letter—&amp; now day before yesterday a second hunt—but cannot find it, 
        &amp; fear it has been destroyed or lost—I am distressed that I cannot find &amp; return it, 
        as I know you think so much of your friend's letters—(Besides moving in this house 
        from the former one—I have twice hurriedly destroyed a large mass of letters 
        &amp; MSS.—to be ready for what might happen)<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—</p>
      
        <p class="tei_p">I am indeed interested in what you write about Mrs. Huntington<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—it does not surprise me that she meets emergencies, &amp;c. so splendidly &amp; expands 
            to greater womanly beauty &amp; development—I always thought it in her to do so—Nelly, when you next see her give her my love—I return Willie's<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> picture—dear child—it has pleased me much—I held it a long time in my hand &amp; thought of H street—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I think very highly everyway of little Harold's picture—it is, to begin with, one of the best photos ever taken, &amp; it seems so beautiful, 
        &amp; a real <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">man-child</span>—I liked it much, &amp; have always kept it where I could see it. 
        (Nelly, did you wish me to return it? I have overlooked—or forgotten—any request to that effect in the letter sending it)—</p>
      
        <p class="tei_p">I send my love to Mrs. Brownell—also to Garry Howard<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> when you see her—(what you say of her in your letter I fully endorse as my mature conviction—she is a good, tender girl—true as steel.) Nelly dear, I am guiltless of the cologne present—(don't know any thing about Peter Doyle, in this case)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, I feel that you are—or have been—under the depressing influences of 
          Mr Dilles's<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> and Mr. Townsend's<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> deaths—If it were eligible you should come frequently &amp; spend the days with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">me</span>, to cheer you up—meantime take early opportunities to get a change of scene of surroundings—&amp; often—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">It is very fine here, to-day—I have been hobbling out—plenty of snow on the 
        ground—but air, sun &amp; sky delightful—</p>
      
      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt</span>
      </span>
      
      
        <p class="tei_p">nearly 5—It is near sundown, very fine, &amp; I am going out—as I like to be on the river, 
          (on those strong boats crashing through the ice now plentiful on the Delaware)—I shall probably cross to <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_place"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil</span>​ </span>—&amp; mail this letter thence.
        </p>

                    Whitman's catalogs, mystic raptures, and lack of restraint. On <a href="582">February 14, 1874</a>, Whitman sent a manuscript entitled "Is Walt
