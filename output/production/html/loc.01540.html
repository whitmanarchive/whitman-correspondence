                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
                    Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>,

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
                    more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Charles Hine, a painter to whom 
                    he wrote on <a href="loc.01579">May 9, 1868</a>. On August 4, 1871 Hine's wife informed Whitman of her
                    husband's death: "I think after your visit to him that his hold on life seemed to 
                    give way and his yearnings were all accomplished." Mrs. Hine, who visited Louisa 
                    Van Velsor Whitman on August 22, 1871, thought it "strange" that Whitman 
                    did not write. According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter of 
                    <a href="duk.00605">September 30, 1871</a>, Mrs. Hine had received a "donation" from Walt Whitman.
