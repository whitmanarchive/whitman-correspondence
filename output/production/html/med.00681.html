                (of course for your consideration—you may have something behind which I do not

                me—clearly though rapidly feeling as I went along that the article would be
                bettered &amp; more unitary without them. What you set out mainly to say &amp; have
                to say, seems to me very well said indeed, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I like the

                of America, I dont like so well—(besides it is unnecessary any how—Unless one has
