                    by the following: on March 31, 1883, Whitman noted in his Commonplace Book
                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) that he had "read John Burroughs's
                    'Carlyle' proof"; on May 20 Burroughs referred to his article to which he was
                    "adding a page about Mrs. C. as revealed by her letters" (Syracuse University;
                    Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.77.html"> Sunday, April 7, 1889</a>, 510); and the article, entitled "Carlyle,"
                    appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Century Magazine</span> in August, 1883. After
                    writing "Carlyle and Emerson" for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span>, 2 (20 May
                    1882), 140–141, and an unsigned review of Froude's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Thomas Carlyle</span> in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Century Magazine</span>, 24
                    (June 1882), 307–308, Burroughs began to gather material for a more
                    extended article, as he informed Whitman from London on <a href="loc.01141">June 16, 1882</a> (Traubel, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.37.html"> Monday, August 20, 1888</a>, 171). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
