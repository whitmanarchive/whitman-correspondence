            <p class="tei_p">I have received, (through Mr. Clausen)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> your letter of 19th October, from Kopenhagen—&amp; I cheerfully forward you my poems "Leaves of Grass," &amp; a small prose work of mine, "Democratic Vistas." I also enclose several articles &amp; criticisms written about my books in England &amp; America within the last ten years.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">May I say, there is something about your letter &amp; application that has deeply pleased me. I should like to know your country &amp; people—&amp; especially you yourself, &amp; your poet Björnson<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—and Hans Andersen. How proud I should be to become known to you all.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pray let me hear from you—and if the books &amp; papers reach you safely.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Please accept my best, brotherly good will.</p>

                    October 19, 1871, "I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
                    in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
                    countries.…I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be

                    Schmidt's letter "my old friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt after
                    he left Denmark in 1860; see Carl Roos, "Walt Whitman's Letters to a Danish
                    Friend," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Orbis Litterarum</span>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The
                    city directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent
                    agent. He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see Thomas Biggs Harned

                    Björnson (1832–1910), Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist, was
                    co-editor of Schmidt's journal. In his reply on <a href="syr.00004">January
                        5, 1872</a>, Schmidt observed: "Hans Christian Andersen would perhaps not
                    make you very great joy, if you did know him personally. Björnson would be
                    your man." Schmidt later altered his opinion of Björnson; see notes to
                    Whitman's <a href="rlc.00003">March 19, 1874</a> letter to Schmidt. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
