                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have received, (through Mr. Clausen) your letter of 19th October, from Kopenhagen—&amp; I cheerfully forward you my poems "Leaves of Grass," &amp; a small prose work of mine, "Democratic Vistas." I also enclose several articles &amp; criticisms written about my books in England &amp; America within the last ten years.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">May I say, there is something about your letter &amp; application that has deeply pleased me. I should like to know your country &amp; people—&amp; especially you yourself, &amp; your poet Björnson—and Hans Andersen. How proud I should be to become known to you all.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pray let me hear from you—and if the books &amp; papers reach you safely.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Please accept my best, brotherly good will.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Any thing by mail will reach me addressed</p>
