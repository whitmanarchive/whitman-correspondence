                        16, 1873. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman follows a
                        letter on the same sheet of paper from Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman to Walt.
                        Louisa Orr Haslam dated her letter "Friday." May 16, 1873, the date Richard
                        Maurice Bucke assigned to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter, fell on
                        Friday. Edwin Haviland Miller dated this letter "about" May 17, 1873 (Walt
                        Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1961–75], 2:220, n. 85). Miller's date is incorrect
                        because May 17 fell on Saturday in 1873.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In his letter of <a href="yal.00417">May 16, 1873</a>, Walt
                        acknowledged his mother's <a href="duk.00610">May 13 or 14, 1873</a>
                        letter as the first one that he had received in several days. This letter
                        must therefore follow Louisa's May 13 or 14, 1873 letter, and it cannot date
                        to May 23, 1873, the next Friday and day of Louisa's death. Walt arrived at
                        the home of his brother George Washington Whitman in Camden, New Jersey, on
                        May 20, 1873 (see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary
                            Singer</span> [New York, Macmillan, 1955], 452).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This letter may be the final letter that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman sent to
                        her son Walt. Another letter, which was probably written later, may not have
                        been sent (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="uva.00365">May
