            <p class="tei_p">I send you a hurried line as Herbert is going up for a few days—I want to come up &amp; be with you all awhile—I am getting much nearer to Herby, &amp; he is already a great comfort to me—I keep well as lately, &amp; enjoy the creek &amp;c as much as ever—but perhaps a little variation would be acceptable &amp; salutary to me—I shall come up soon—let us all be together awhile if agreeable, (I am not willing to have Herby absent when I am there)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Have you been over to Camden since? I was so much obliged to you for your good letter about my sister &amp; all, &amp; your kind invitation to my <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">neices​ </span><span class="tei_corr">nieces​
