            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your postal card was duly received.—I got all your papers and very glad of them.
                Especially the Boston Transcripts, Critics, Liberty &amp;c—I am glad to see the
                notices of William that appear occasionally, but they give a
                very faint idea of the man to those who knew him best—If I had power of
                literary expression I would try to write something—If you had your health and
                strength I know you could give just the right touches which would preserve the
                portrait of an uncommonly gifted mind—John Burroughs
                might do it but he lacks sympathy I think with certain fiery and vivid types of
                which Wm. was a bright exemplar.—But perhaps it is just as well. "The silent
                organ loudest chants the masters requiem"—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am going up and down this fair land and watching the vintage "from which streams of
                brandy do flow. By which I only mean that they are gathering and pressing

                vineyards—1000 acre vineyards not uncommon with five tons of grapes to the
                acre—and from the new wine brandy is largely distilled, we are in the height
                of brandy making season with which the internal revenue department is largely
                concerned—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Saw your interview with Edwin Arnold
                and much touched by it.—The applause of other nations, if not your own, begins
                to be heard in your declining years. May every comfort and blessing gather around
                you as your steps grow slow brother beloved.—I hope to see you next year.</p>
