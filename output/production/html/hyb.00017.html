                Especially the Boston Transcripts, Critics, Liberty &amp;c—I am glad to see the

                very faint idea of the man to those who knew him best—If I had power of
                literary expression I would try to write something—If you had your health and
                strength I know you could give just the right touches which would preserve the
                portrait of an uncommonly gifted mind—John Burroughs<a href="#n0129" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0129">3</a>
                might do it but he lacks sympathy I think with certain fiery and vivid types of
                which Wm. was a bright exemplar.—But perhaps it is just as well. "The silent

                    of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
                    the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In December 1862, on
                    his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman
                    stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk in the
                    office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge helped Whitman gain employment in Hapgood's office.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    was a British poet and journalist best known for his long narrative poem, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> (1879), which tells the life story and
                    philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely responsible for introducing
                    Buddhism to Western audiences. Arnold visited Whitman in Camden in 1889. For an
                    account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.158.html">Friday, September 13, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.159.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering," Whitman
                    concluded. Arnold published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and Lands</span> (1891), in which he averred that the two
                    read from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis,
                    knitting, a handsome young man (Ned Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at
                    least two additional accounts of Arnold's visit with Whitman; "Arnold and
                    Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Times</span>
