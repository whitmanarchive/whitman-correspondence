                    on <a href="loc.01566">November 13, 1867</a>) on April 22, 1874. On
                    December 29, 1873, Walt Whitman withdrew his books from O'Kane, and also
                    dismissed Piper, the Boston outlet. At the same time he entrusted the whole
                    matter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Co., which went into bankruptcy in the following
                    year. Though Walt Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on <a href="loc.01717">April 22, 1874</a>, he later became hostile. Citing only the initials,
                    Richard Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (1883), in his
                    "official" biography (46), averred that O'Kane and Somerby, Butts's successor,
                    "took advantage of [Walt Whitman's] helplessness to embezzle the amounts
                    due—(they calculated that death would soon settle the score and rub it
                    out.)" This sounds like an interpolation composed by the poet himself; note also
                    Whitman's <a href="yal.00418">December 30, 1875</a>, letter to Jeannette
                    Gilder, in which he wrote, "every one of the three successive book agents I have
                    had in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds." In an address book (The Library of
                    Congress #108) Walt Whitman scrawled on a piece of O'Kane's stationery,
                    "rascal." </span></span> [<a href="#r0454">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01717_n2 note" id="loc.01717_n2"><span>See also Whitman's <a href="loc.01716">September 13, 1873</a> letter to O'Kane and his <a href="loc.01718">February 4, 1874</a> letter to Asa K.
