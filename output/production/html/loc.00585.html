                    been the editor at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> when Whitman
                    published there in 1860. Unbeknownst to Whitman, however, James T. Fields,
                    partner in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic's</span> publisher Ticknor &amp; Fields,
                    took over the editorship of the magazine in May 1861 as a cost-saving measure.
                    The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span> did not publish a list of its editors, and
                    Whitman was not the only writer to submit to Lowell in error. On October 8,
                    Lowell wrote to Fields promising some of his own work soon and enclosing "an
                    article by Mr. S. A. Eliot—and three [poems] from Walt Whitman. '1861' he
                    says is $20. the others $8. each." <a href="loc.00585">Two days later</a>, Whitman received an
                    impersonal reply—signed only "Editors of the Atlantic
                    Monthly"—returning "the three poems with which you have favored us, but
                    which we could not possibly use before their interest,—which is of the
                    present,—would have passed." </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
