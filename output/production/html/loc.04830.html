                    (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
                    Whitman. Along with John Johnston (1852–1927), a physician from Bolton, he
                    founded the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. For more

                    Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid cyclist.
                    Johnston worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of
                    ambulance classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways (John Anson,

                    and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the United
                    States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of their

                    never recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel
                    Longaker of Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care
                    during his final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
