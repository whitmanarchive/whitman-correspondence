            <p class="tei_p">Your altogether good letter came to hand <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">yesterdy​ </span></span> morn: old, new, and genial. Nothing like a ducking—apropos of your
                journey to Kirkwood amid the pouring rain—nothing like a ducking I say to
                make a fellow appreciate sunshine, the old story light and shade—: By jove
                though we <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">havent​ </span></span> seen the sun here for one, two, three, four days: a solid 
                impenetrable white mist shutting that divine element away from our view: we are like

            <p class="tei_p">You say Glendale woods are wintry &amp; bare, but there is no such colour as is to be met with as in winter landscape so full and varied where the
                hungry eye rests upon a dash of emerald green with startled pleasure and is amazed
                at the depth of hue in the leafless twigs &amp; branches of myriads of trees.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The chiming of church bells float musically up Haverstock Hill greeting my ears
                pleasantly as I sit here in our pretty drawing-room writing this. I shall be sorry
                when nations no longer go to church &amp; church

            bells cease chiming, but I needn't worry for it wont be in my time any how.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish too that you could send me some cedar branches thick with the china-blue little
                plums strange, I have no recollection of such things in America. Yes, I have glanced
                at the Guiteau trial
                curious isn't it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The surroundings at Glendale suit you when you are there I am glad, you are in
                relation with that which is in harmony with you.</p>

                is staying with us, Carpenter introduced her to us.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Carpenter stayed a few days with us a week or two ago, &amp; was looking very
                flourishing has grown a beard which becomes him, he has given up lecturing, for
                little gardening and a little literature and a little democratic sociableness etc:
                Friday evening Henry Holmes—one on the first violinists here in London very
                good-naturedly volunteered to stand to me for a picture of Consuelo &amp;
                Hayden playing at the canons window; so that I am painting I shall get the proper professional twist in the
                handling of the violin besides he has explained the good points <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wch</span>​  a violin should possess: as a musician he praises the conception of my picture and
                seems interested</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The women think that Carpenter is not looking well.</p>
