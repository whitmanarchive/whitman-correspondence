                about thee yesterday. There are a great many of the "coming men" there who are deeply
                influenced by "Leaves of Grass" &amp; who find in the curious English mingling of
                tradition &amp; freedom, history &amp; change, the most appropriate setting to thy
                lines of Thought. Probably it is only the stress of urgent national crises, such as
                a war, or of equally urgent national reforms, of which there are many now

            <p class="tei_p">As thee says—"all goes on well in the United States"—and though one
                cannot wish for any lack of prosperity, seeing what miseries it entails upon the
                poor &amp; defenceless, yet one realizes that it is not, as yet, the best condition
                for the appreciation of bright things. From another point of view,

                in which perhaps thee will not agree with me, I think the "Saints" were quite right
                in attempting to free the spirit by torturing the body!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Our chief political interest now is in watching, &amp; assisting as far as we can,
                the spread of "Socialism"—It seems to be permeating everything. I cannot now
                imagine what life would be like with no interest in politics! And yet I used to be
                very happy in Germantown!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We had a more interesting visit to Logan. He is very busy, outside his College work,
                with a "Social Science Club," &amp; also with an attempt to reduce the excessive expenses
                of Oxford, which make it impossible for any poor men to get educated there. As rich
                people have evidently no monopoly of brains, it is a great pity that all this
                splendid training is accessible only to them. Some day a Royal Commission or

                expose the manifold inequities of that most delightful of all
                Universities—&amp; perhaps things will be changed then. We spent all our
                Sunday discussing the desirable reforms of Oxford, but in spite of that we shall go
                again to visit it, even in its unregeneate state, as soon as we possibly can.

                playing with blocks, &amp; both nurses are adding a not insignificant share to the

                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
