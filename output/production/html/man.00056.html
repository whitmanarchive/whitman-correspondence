                <span class="milestone undeclared tei_milestone tei_milestone_unit_undeclared tei_milestone_rend_horbar-short-center"> </span>
                <p class="tei_p">In this column we give, from the Phila. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span>, a letter
                    from Dr. Bucke that, in justice to our Good Gray Poet, should be widely
                    circulated. Scribblers are too prone to attack every man or woman who exhibits
                    the least originality,—with about the same reason that the crows display
                    in pecking to death one of their kind happening to have a white feather or other
                    peculiarity unlike the persecutors themselves. Intolerance of religious belief
                    has the same petty and malignant origin,—I am better and holier than
                    thou, so go to, and be damned to everlasting torments!</p>
                <p class="tei_p">We have known Walt Whitman the poet, and found him ever gentlemanly in demeanor,
                    cleanly in habits and careful in his dress—not flaunting a red, open
                    shirt, and wearing a tarpaulin hat as has been asserted by <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">him​ </span></span> enemies. Even in his younger days, there is the best of evidence that
                    his habits were correct, and his conversation ennobling—as became one to
                    whom was entrusted by his Creator the sacred fire of genius. If he had been
                    ill-dressed and low-minded, it is hardly probable that the beloved poet, William
                    Cullen Bryant, should have made young Whitman his bosom companion. Often the two
                    youthful poets, while engaged in New York or Brooklyn printing offices, before
                    or after working hours met to take long walks together, so that by sweet
                    converse amid the beauties of nature, there might be satisfied that longing each
                    possessed for the poetic and prophetic afflatus, to unravel the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">mystires​ </span></span> of Life or Death.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">When Walt Whitman began writing his peculiarly original poems, one of the first
                    to give cordial recognition and praise was the philosopher Emerson. Charles
                    Sumner, too, gave Whitman, unasked, the warmest commendation, as writer of the
                    grandest dirge upon the lamented Lincoln ever composed. We have evidence, as
                    well, that our New Jersey poet is a profound thinker upon religious and moral
                    themes. One of his very latest compositions is a lecture upon Elias Hicks, one
                    the great lights of modern Quakerism. But to hear some ignorant fellows talk
                    about Walt Whitman, one would think him a nasty and eccentric old lunatic;
                    instead of the quiet gentleman and the poet and thinker that he is.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">"Your report in to-day's paper of Colonel Ingersoll's Tuesday evening lecture,
                        on "What Shall I Do to be Saved?" is interspersed every second or third
                        paragraph with "Amen from Walt Whitman," the poet's name appearing in this
                        manner in the long report and introduction some eight or ten times. It was
                        at my invitation that Mr. Whitman went to the lecture, and I sat at his side
                        throughout its delivery. He neither uttered the "Amen" which the reporter
                        puts so often in his mouth, nor once made any sign whatever, either by voice
                        or hand, of approval or disapproval, but maintained his usual
                        undemonstrative manner throughout. The "Amens" were uttered by a person
                        immediately to the left of Mr. Whitman; the mistake was therefore a natural
                        one.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">While I am about it, would you give me room to correct "The Genesis of Walt
                        Whitman" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Appleton's Journal</span>—not the
                        malignance and falsehood of the
                        whole article, but a small specimen brick. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Journal</span> speaks of Walt Whitman as habitually wearing, while living
                        in New York, a red flannel shirt, a blouse and a tarpaulin hat. It doesn't
                        seem to me to matter if he did; but the fact is, he never in his life donned
                        either of those articles. Whitman always dressed about the same as he does
                        now.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Another: Not long since the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Inquirer</span> of this city
                        published a lengthy article on cremation, giving interviews with prominent
                        men and their views on the subject—among the rest a long string
                        purporting to come from Walt Whitman. A day or two after the poet received a
                        letter from the author of the article, saying that as he had been pressed for
                        time he had taken the liberty to manufacture and print a set of opinions for
                        Walt Whitman without consulting him—and hoped to be excused!</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Then one more: I am informed that an elderly, full-bearded, gray haired artist
                        has for years been frequenting the barrooms and hotels of this city, his
                        chums introducing him to strangers as "Walt Whitman," he being always ready
                        to take a drink in that character!</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">You might say that such mistakes and "roasts" are not very important, and, at
                        all events, get rectified in time. But they don't—not by any means—always; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they often make so-called history.</span>
                        Walt Whitman himself laughs at them as merely amusing, but they are very
                        painful to his friends, who are more in number and warmer than perhaps is
                        generally suspected, and, as one of these, I write you this letter, which I
                        hope you will have the kindness to insert."</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">In justice to the Phila. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Inquirer</span>, we must state
                        that this excellent newspaper had nothing to do with getting up the bogus
                        interview with Walt Whitman recently about "Cremation" (mentioned elsewhere)
                        except that with other matter it was purchased from the reporter and printed
                        upon faith. The intemperate scribbler who got up, "out of his own head," the
                        so-called interview, had become a slave of rum, and was fast sinking from an
                        honored position on the reportorial staff of the newspaper. Since the hoax
                        was printed this reporter has died from effects of his dissipation.</p>

                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the
                    Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until
                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> (see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November

                    eventually won the party's nomination during the 1880 Republican convention in

                    was a Republican New York senator from 1867 to 1881. He was a fierce supporter
                    of President Ulysses S. Grant and strongly opposed James G. Blaine's potential
                    nomination as the Republican candidate for the 1880 presidential election. He
                    was greatly displeased with Blaine's eventual promotion to Secretary of State
                    under President Garfield. This created a rift between Conkling and Garfield
                    which ended in Conkling's resignation from the Senate. </span></span> [<a href="#r1016">back</a>]</li><li id="n0625">5. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0625 note" id="n0625"><span>Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n1014">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n1014 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n1014"><span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Adam Bede</span>
