            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs came this mn'g, &amp; was welcome (&amp; you w'd be y'rself)—I am 
                here yet, a peg additional dropping out every successive month or so but 
                in many things <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the same subject continued</span>—bladder trouble
                &amp; the grip (aggravated cold in the head &amp; stomach) are the worst—but I still 
                keep pretty fair spirits &amp; (fortunately) a stout strong right arm considering. 
                Things in the house are ab't same—Mrs: Davis has just been in, is 
                well—Warren has gone over to Phila—I am sitting here in the big chair 
                with wolf skin spread over back—fine sunny day out—cold—no sleighing 
                here—write when you can, dear boy, &amp; I will too—God bless you—</p>
