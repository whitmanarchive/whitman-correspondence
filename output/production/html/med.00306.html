                    Swinton: "Now, Walt, if you will remember among the first men that blowed for
                    Grant and wrote him up, so to speak, was our friend John Swinton. . . . Now I am
                    positive that a letter could be got from Swinton to Grant signed as Editor of
                    the Times asking that a special exchange might be made in George's case."
                    Swinton replied to Whitman on <a href="loc.00870">February 5, 1865</a>,
                    and included a letter to Grant in which he closely paraphrased Whitman's letter.
                    In a lost letter, Whitman informed his family that he had written to Swinton,
                    and, on <a href="loc.00436">February 7</a>, Jeff replied that "we are all
                    very joyful," and that Dr. Ruggles had visited Swinton "to urge him to write to
                    Gen Grant." According to George M. Williamson, with Whitman's letter there is
                    another from Lieutenant Colonel E. S. Parker, Grant's military secretary, dated
                    February 13, 1865, informing Swinton that the cases of the two officers "had
                    been ordered to be made a subject of special exchange" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Catalogue of a Collection of Books, Letters, and Manuscripts Written by

                    endorsed the envelope: "W. W. 1865 Asking me to help his captured brother.
