                    for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
                    December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
                    Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
                    some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
                    Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
