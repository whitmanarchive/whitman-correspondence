                    (1826–1919) was an etcher, engraver, and artist. Born February 24, 1846,
                    at St. George, Bloomsbury, Camden, England, Hollyer was the son of Samuel
                    Hollyer, a gentleman, and his wife Mary Ann. Hollyer emigrated to the United
                    States in the early 1850s, but traveled to England to marry Madeline Charlotte
                    Chevalier, the daughter of the artist William Chevalier, at St. Pancras Parish
                    Chapel in October 1863. The couple returned to the United States, residing in
                    New Jersey and, later, New York for the remainder of their lives. Hollyer's
                    engraving of Whitman as a laborer appears in the first edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, published in 1855. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_wil.00005_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_genoways tei_note_type_editorial note" id="wil.00005_n2"><span>This letter is

                    to request permission to make the etching. On <a href="loc.02321">April 3,
                        1888</a>, Whitman sent Hollyer a photograph taken ca. 1876 by Jacob
                    Spieler at the Charles H. Spieler Studios in Philadelphia, which Whitman
                    referred to as the "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/zzz.00045.html">Lear</a>"
                    (reproduced in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, ed. Edwin Haviland
                    Miller, vol. 4, following page 278, and in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>
                    [1971], plate 180). Whitman referred favorably to the finished etching on <a href="loc.07651">August 4, 1888</a>, in his letter to the Canadian
                    physician Richard Maurice Bucke, and in his Commonplace Book on the preceding

                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For Whitman's
