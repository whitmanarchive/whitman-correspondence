                    <span class="tei_salute"> Dear Sir:— </span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p"> Spending a few weeks in Merchantville, in "the leafy month of June," I took
                    occasion, one bright Sunday morning, to call and pay my respects to you. I had
                    previously, on visiting Philadelphia, two or three times taken the same liberty
                    and enjoyed the same pleasure; once with my friend E. J. Loomis, of the Nautical
                    Almanac Office. For you had yourself, in certain "Messenger Leaves," extended an
                    invitation to persons unknown to you to hail you and exchange a few words with
                    you, if they felt an impulse so to do. </p>
                <p class="tei_p">
                    <span class="inline_quote">"Stranger! if you, passing, meet me, and desire to speak to me, why should
                        you not speak to me, why should you not speak to me? And why should I not speak
                        to you?"</span>
                </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> Had I received such a Leaf in Washington, years ago, where I often saw you, I
                    think I should have hailed you and wished you w<span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_high">ell</span>, 
                    even in the public street; for I even then desired to speak to you. I remember that once, taking a stroll
                    over the hills beyond the Anacostia, I gathered a small bunch of wild-flowers,
                    and, on returning home, finding you seated in the same car, I was impelled to
                    offer you the little bouquet—a spontaneous, simple tribute to "the good
                    gray poet"—which you accepted very courteously, with thanks. </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> On my last visit to you, I was glad to see you so, apparently, much better in
                    health than I had anticipated finding you. Though you expressed yourself as
                    calmly and patiently awaiting the summons to "emigrate" into the great Unknown,
                    I hope that the summons may be deferred for may years to come, and that, daring
                    them, such vigor of mind and body may remain to you as that life be not a burthen. </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> I promised to send you an epigram which on a certain occurrence in 1882—a
                    proceeding disgraceful to one of These States—my indignation impelled me
                    to pen. I gave a copy of it to your valorous champion, O'Connor,<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">1</a> but I do not
                    know whether he ever sent it to you. </p>

                <p class="tei_p"> I have a dim remembrance that I also sent it to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Puck</span>,
                    with a clipping from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Evening Star</span>. I do not think,
                    however, that it was ever printed. It may perchance amuse you. At any rate I
                    have promised to let you have it, and you will find it transcribed herein. </p>
