            <p class="tei_p">Ab't the same as usual—a rare egg &amp; Graham bread &amp; prunes &amp; coffee
                for my breakfast—I am pretty moderate in eating, &amp; w'd be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">abstemious</span>, but I fancy a fairly efficient fortification in
                stomach helps keep at bay quite many of the wolfs &amp; wolflets of old fellows'
                physical (&amp; perhaps all fellows) attacks. I take no medicines at
                all—hardly any alcoholic drink—never beer—eat plain
                fare—never risk—the trick is to steer between that last mention'd need
                to keep the wolf away &amp; the benefit of very light food-eating, wh' is
                decided for an old fellow—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose my latest pieces—(have not yet seen the Feb: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> but suppose the poemet is in it)—have just been engaged to write some little bits for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Munyon's Illustrated World</span> (monthly Phila)—will send you when
                printed—$10 each, one paid—So far have
                escaped the grip, (but I guess I have the am't of it in my physical brain already,
                &amp; have had two years)—Alys Smith comes
                regularly, does me good to see her—She is the handsomest, healthiest best
                balanced young woman in the world known to me—have quite many
                visitors—sold a big book yesterday—</p>
