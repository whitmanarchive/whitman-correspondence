                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief
                    organizer. She attended Bryn Mawr College and was a graduate of the class of
                    1890. She and her family lived in Britain for two years during her childhood and
                    again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
                    chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
                    St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
                    to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
                    educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
                    Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
                    (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." </span></span> [<a href="#r7014">back</a>]</li><li id="n4188">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4188 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4188"><span>Whitman often referred to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span> (1888) as his "big book." The
                    volume was published by the poet himself in an arrangement with publisher David
                    McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves
                        of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>—in December
                    1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding
                    decisions, and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo
                    of the poet on the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom,
