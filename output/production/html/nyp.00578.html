            <p class="tei_p">Have rec'd to-day yours of Feb. 21. 
                Send you herewith a little Preface to "Specimen Days"—it might make two pages—
                Send me three or four slip impressions
                when in type—Yes, you can retain the Edgar Poe lines on p 17 as you
                wish—&amp; in brief (having no doubt you will remember what I have said or
                suggested) I hereby empower you to make any arrangements or ways the publishing
                exigencies there or your own judgment require—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will probably send a short MS to be added on p 199 or p 200 to bring my diary up
                (or nearly up) to date—Something possibly also to the 2d Vol.—giving
                both books a touch (at any rate) of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">original identity</span> &amp;
                fulness—</p>
