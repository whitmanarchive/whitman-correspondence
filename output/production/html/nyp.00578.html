                    23, 1889, Rhys offered Harry Buxton Forman a number of Whitman manuscripts
                    including "'Specimen Days &amp; Collect' with Whitman's corrections in

                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> on February 2, 1887 (Whitman's

                    off-hand about the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>,—that is, whether
                    to make two vols. as you suggest, or to try &amp; get the whole into one. In the
                    latter case, the book would be rather crowded. . . No! I would not think of
                    putting the copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> with your corrections
                    into the printers' hands and will get copies from Wilson of Glasgow, carefully
                    following all your deletions &amp; so on. It is one of the greatest prizes I
                    possess, &amp; someday a sense of its value will inspire me, I'm afraid, to beg
                    you to send me a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> too with your
                    name in it, (&amp; mine, as proof of ownership,) &amp; some further inscription
                    as well." On <a href="loc.03316">January 19, 1887</a> Rhys wrote at length
                    about a kind of epiphany which he had experienced at the seashore; Whitman
                    termed it "a wonderful letter." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
