                    agreed to publish Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1881, but
                    the firm stopped publication after Whitman refused to comply with the Boston
                    district attorney, who had written to the publisher demanding some poems and
                    passages removed. Osgood was also the publisher of Browning, Arnold, Holmes,
                    Henry James, and Howells; see Carl J. Weber, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Rise and Fall

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
