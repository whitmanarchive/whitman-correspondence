                    was evidently killed at Culpeper, Virginia, about the time that James was

                    James and Julia Stilwell, was evidently killed at Culpeper, Virginia, about the
                    time that James was wounded. Whitman was mistaken about the body, however,
                    since, according to Margaret Stilwell's letter of <a href="loc.00599">October 25, 1863</a>, members of the family had been refused a pass to
                    Culpeper. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00147_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00147_n3"><span>James S. Stilwell, Second
                    New York Cavalry, was confined in Ward C of Armory Square with a gunshot wound
                    in his left leg; see "Notebook: Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection) and "Hospital Notes" (Henry E. Huntington Library). He
                    recovered slowly from his injury. About the end of May in the following year he
                    was sent to Mower Hospital, Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, where he remained until
                    he was granted a furlough in August 1864. He later returned to Mower Hospital
                    and wrote to Whitman on <a href="nyp.00172">September 27, 1864</a>, that
                    his wound was "most healed up," and that he expected either to be discharged or
                    to be transferred to New York. See also Stilwell's letters to Whitman from <a href="duk.00373">July 5, 1864</a>, and <a href="nyp.00168">September
                        2, 1864</a>. He was the brother of Julia and John Stilwell. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
