            <p class="tei_p">    
                Every thing is going on right here, &amp; ab't as usual—I keep ab't the same, &amp; well enough considering—went out 
                yesterday afternoon, (Warry<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">2</a> wheel'd me up of course in the chair<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a>) to Mr &amp; Mrs: Harned's<a href="#n4146" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4146">4</a> 
                where we had a first–rate dinner (my 5 o'clock supper) of champagne &amp; oysters—the best &amp; plenty—come back just 
                after 8. Both Mr and Mrs H so hospitable &amp; generous &amp; good to me—Mrs Doughty and Maggy are well &amp; Mrs D does very 
                well—gives me plenty for my meals &amp; all right<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a>—we've killed one of the roosters, (he 
                behaved very badly &amp; put on airs) and had a chicken pot pie &amp; I had some of the c[hicken] for my breakfast this morning—&amp; 
                some new coffee better than the old, (wh' was not good)—My appetite is good as ever—Warry is well &amp; jolly &amp; keeps 
                first rate &amp; good to me—go out towards evn'g as ever—last night it rained &amp; keeps it half–up to day, &amp; is cloudy 
                &amp; dark &amp; half warm—Warry has just been in to make up the bed, &amp;c:—
                </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                The most important event is Harry's marrying,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> which is to come off this evn'g, to be by Squire Tarr<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">7</a> at his house—
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Harry was up with me yesterday noon to talk ab't it—I felt quite solemn ab't it (I think more of the boy, &amp; I believe he does 
                of me, than we knew)—He kissed me &amp; hung on to my neck—O if he only gets a good wife &amp; it all turns out lasting &amp; 
                good (Mary, I think more of Harry than you suppose)—at any rate one first–rate point, it may anchor him in a way that nothing else 
                might, &amp; give him a definite object &amp; aim to work up to—(&amp; perhaps he needs that)—I am sitting up in my big den, 
                in the old chair as I write, every thing comfortable—

                little while, at my special invitation—I have had my breakfast (Warry broiled a bit of meat for me, very nice)—the sun has 
                been under a cloud, but I see it is plainly coming out—Love to you f'm me &amp; all of us—I enclose $5, 2 for Mrs: M[apes],<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">8</a>

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
