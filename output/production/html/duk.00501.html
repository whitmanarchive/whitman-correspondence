            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00501.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00501.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00501.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            he and smith went to look
            at some lots yesterday
            they liked
            very much on the corner of
            tomkins
                avenu  and lafaette st
                
            george says it is very fine
            but it is a plot and the price
            is 3000 dollar cash the turners
            has the selling of it he has gone
            again to day to see what they
            can doo george says he knows
            you would like it it is within
            one block of the decalb ave cars
            if they could get it they would
            build a number of smalish houses
            he says the neigberhood is
            very good but he is afraid they
            cant manage to get it
            so when i next write
            i dont know what the progress
            will be but Walt you must
            not be alarmed if you hear
            we have bough the
            lickfield
            property or maybee some of
            the shantys on the park i often
            think if i had a shanty i could
            be contented where i could be
            at peace and not have to move</p>
