                    (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry. Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman mentioned a J. W. Mason who "used to be in my party on the
                    Water Works" in his <a href="loc.00398">February 10, 1863</a> to Walt
                    Whitman. Mason became a career army officer, and he assisted in getting supplies
                    to George when he was held prisoner. Mason remained in the army until dying of
                    apoplexy in 1882. His father George F. Mason was a prominent Pennsylvania
                    businessman and state senator, with whom Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman stayed
                    after selling her furniture in preparation for departure to St. Louis. See Jeff

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
                    later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
                    (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
