                for it. I drank the whole bottle (except a little swig I insisted on Ed<a href="#n4319" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4319">1</a> taking for going for it) had it in a big white mug half fill'd
                with broken ice, it has done me good already (for I was sort of "under the weather"

                    (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
                    sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,
                    1893, and then he returned to the United States to commence his practice in
                    Alexandria, Indiana. For more information, see Bert A. Thompson, "Edward
