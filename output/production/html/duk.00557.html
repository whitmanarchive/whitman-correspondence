                    earlier than November 30, 1868 and no later than December 3, 1868. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke dated the letter to December 1, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller
                    also assigned the letter the date of December 1, 1868 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:366). The letter addresses multiple family matters in common
                    with other letters from late 1868 that are consistent with Bucke's and Miller's
                    month and day: Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's presence in Brooklyn after
                    arriving from St. Louis in late November, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter
                    Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's recent thumb surgery, and the diminishing probability
                    that Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman will visit Walt Whitman
                    in Washington. Louisa had mentioned Jeff and Mattie's possible trip to
                    Washington in her <a href="duk.00556">November 25, 1868</a> letter to
                    Walt, so this letter's update that their trip was no longer probable dates this
                    letter a week after that November 25 letter. Also, Louisa's <a href="duk.00558">November 28 to December 12, 1868</a> letter to Walt,
                    which offers further details about Hannah's thumb problems from Heyde's letter,
                    is most likely to follow this one. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
                    Louisa often spoke disparagingly of Charles in her letters to Walt Whitman. For

                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie had arrived in Brooklyn from St. Louis for medical treatment
                    and a holiday visit in mid-October 1868. Jeff joined his wife and children near

                    of this letter, Mattie was being treated for the throat ailment that will lead
                    to her death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
