                <span class="tei_salute">Dear sir:</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Supposing that the books &amp; papers I sent you in response to your letter have safely arrived, I thought I would now write you a few lines. What I have to submit &amp; say, I will just say without ceremony—confident you will receive it in the same spirit in which it is written.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I sent you (by Mr. Clausen<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>) my poems "Leaves of Grass"—and little prose work "Democratic Vistas"—also a piece I recited at opening of an Exhibition of Industry in New York;<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> adding several criticisms, sketches, &amp;c. about the books &amp; about myself, written by different persons from different points of view. These will furnish you with sufficient material for your examination, digest, &amp;c.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The main object of my poetry is simply to present—sometimes by directions, but oftener by indirections—the Portraiture or model of a sound, large, complete, physiological, emotional, moral, intellectual &amp; spiritual <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Man</span>, a good son, brother, husband, father, friend &amp; practical citizen—&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Woman</span> also, a good wife, mother, practical citizen too—adjusted to the modern, to the New World, to Democracy, &amp; to science. My verse strains its every nerve to arouse, brace, dilate, excite to the love &amp; realization of health, friendship, perfection, freedom, amplitude. There are other objects, but these are the main ones.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The central purpose of "Democratic Vistas" is to project &amp; outline a fresh &amp; brawny race of original American Imaginative authors, with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">moral purpose</span>, Hegelianism, underlying their works, poems—and with Science &amp; Democracy—also thoroughly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">religious</span>—(not ecclesiastical or sectarian merely.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And now an item for your proposed review:</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">When you are composing your review, I would like to have you bring in, in a proper place, the following mentioned facts<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—that neither my poetic "Leaves" or "Democratic Vistas" is cordially accepted in the United States—nor do the chief literary persons or organs of the country admit the poems as having any merit, or recognize the author as a poet at all—that he has once indeed been ignominiously ejected from a moderate government employment at Washington by special order of a Cabinet officer there, for the sole &amp; avowed reason that he was the writer of the book; that up to this time no American publisher will publish it (the author printing the various editions himself)<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—that many of the booksellers refuse to keep it for sale—that the swarms of versifiers and writers of book notices in America are quite generally banded against this new man (myself) and that his position, in his own country, both as to literary recognition &amp; worldly prosperity, has been, and remains to-day, under a heavy &amp; depressing cloud.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Of course you will at the same time hardly need to be told that I take all this very coolly—that my book is written in the sun &amp; with a gay heart—for these surely, fully belong to me. But I think a good foreign review of my works would be more complete by giving those facts—would be hardly complete without them—for they are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the substantial facts</span>, notwithstanding a few exceptions.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Meanwhile, abroad, my book &amp; myself have had a welcome quite dazzling. Tennyson writes me friendly letters, inviting me to become his guest.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> Freilegrath translates &amp; commends my poems. Robert Buchanan,<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">7</a> Swinburne, and all the great English &amp; Dublin colleges, affectionately receive me &amp; doughtily champion me. And while I, the author, am without any recompense at all in America, the English pirate-publisher, Hotten,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">8</a> derives a handsome annual income from a bad &amp; defective London reprint of my Poems.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you to speak of the purpose of "Democratic Vistas." (It is at present in danger of falling still-born here.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I should be glad to hear more from you, your magazine—Denmark too. For all, accept my friendliest good wishes.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Rudolf Schmidt, editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">For Idé og Virkelighed</span>,
                        wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871, "I intend to write an article
                        about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which is very
                        much read in all the Scandinavian countries. …I therefore take the
                        liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
                        communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (Library of
                        Congress).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In this letter Whitman was furnishing information Schmidt sought for his
                        article; see Whitman's <a href="rlc.00002">December 7, 1871</a> letter
                        to Schmidt. This and Whitman's <a href="loc.01491">January 18,

                    Schmidt's letter "my old friend and countryman," corresponded with Schmidt after
                    he left Denmark in 1860; see Carl Roos, "Walt Whitman's Letters to a Danish
                    Friend," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Orbis Litterarum</span>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The
                    city directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent
                    agent. He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see the Thomas Biggs Harned

                    restated what was by this time a somewhat shop-worn charge—a poet
                    systematically persecuted by governmental authority and by American newspapers
                    and journals. In his desire to appear in the role of a martyr, he consistently
                    neglected mention of the coverage he received in the press. Even Horace Traubel,
                    in 1889, dissented from Whitman's opinion; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.11.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> (1906–1996),
                    4:61–62. In addition, sales were better than he admitted; Whitman wrote of
                    strong sales in his <a href="wwh.00009">January 26, 1872</a> letter to
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_rlc.00001_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="rlc.00001_n5"><span>Again Whitman omitted

                    (1841–1901), English poet and critic, had lauded Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Broadway Annual</span> in 1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but
                    attributed his poor reception in England to the sponsorship of William Michael
                    Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. See Harold Blodgett, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman in England</span> (1934), 79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's
                    recantation later in the year may be partly attributable to Buchanan's
