            <p class="tei_p">Forgive the rhymes!<a href="#n1027" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1027">2</a> I have tried, but cannot wield your weapons. I have sent this to
                'Scribner' but I don't suppose they'll take it. I have just been reading an essay on
                'Walt Whitman' in Scribner,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> which, beautifully written
                as it is, rather reminds me of that proverbial representation of Hamlet, with the
                part of Hamlet left out. The supreme value of your works, to me, is that they have
                given me unspeakable <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">religious</span> certitude and confidence, have
                opened my eyes to the realities within and around me, and made me see in them
                something far grander and more assuring than any traditional dogmas. And this work I
                think no <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">poet</span> has hitherto approached, though the great
                metaphysicians have opened the path.—I rather suspect from the essay that
                Stedman is an orthodox Christian? His paragraph on the "Children of Adam" seems to
                me to show either animus or a real want of perception, for obviously the method of
                Nature which he praises so well is just that which <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span>
                followed in those poems—poems for which I, for one, am unreservedly

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    (1833–1908), the American poet and critic, wrote "Walt Whitman" for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's Monthly</span>, 21 (November 1880), 47–64.
                    Stedman differs with some of Whitman's theories and objects to his
                    "over-bodiness." On the other hand, he calls him a man of genius, of striking
                    physical and mental qualities, excelling most writers in personal magnetism,
                    tact, and adroitness as a man of the world, the avowed champion of democracy. He
                    states that Whitman represents, first of all, his own personality; secondly, the
                    conflict with aristocracy and formalism, and remarks that against the latter he
                    early took the position of an iconoclast, avowing that the time had come in
                    which to create an American art by rejection of all forms, irrespective of their
                    natural basis, which had descended from the past. For the reactions of Whitman's
                    friends to Stedman's article, see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and

                    section of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, because of its treatment of

                    Stedman protests the "blunt and open manner" in which Whitman makes the
                    "consummate processes of nature, the acts of procreation and reproduction with
                    all that pertain to them" the theme or illustration of various poems, notably
                    "Children of Adam." Doing so "mistakes the aim of the radical artist or
