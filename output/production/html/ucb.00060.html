                    Commonplace Book, Whitman learned from Thomas W. H. Rolleston that Mrs.
                    Alexander had not received a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span>, which
                    she had ordered in 1878 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                    Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See the letter
                    from Rolleston to Whitman of <a href="man.00017">July 29, 1879</a>. The
                    poet sent the book on August 9, 1879, and so informed Rolleston on the same day,
                    to whom he wrote again on August 14: "sent p. o. letters." Whitman received a
                    postal order for $10 from Mrs. Alexander about November 1, 1879, while he
                    was in St. Louis (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">St. Louis Diary</span>). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
