                £1-1s (one pound, one shilling) was sent to me from Mrs J Alexander, the Palace,
                Derry, Ireland, in June 1878—which P O order has never reached me. See if
                there is any <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​  of it in your office—if not, send this on to New York, to see if any <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​  there—with request that, if necessary they would further inquire of
                the London (or Derry) offices—</p>
