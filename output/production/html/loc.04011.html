                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    books to people who wrote directly to him. According to entries in his
                    Commonplace Book, he received about $30 from these sales since the first of
                    the year (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the

                    evidently mentioned his impending marriage, since Whitman noted it in his
                    Commonplace Book. Interestingly, the poet ignored it in his letter, as he had
                    done in the past when his soldier friends reported their matrimonial plans (see
                    his letters to Benton H. Wilson on <a href="loc.01562">April 12, 1867</a>,
                    and to Alfred Pratt on <a href="loc.01687">July 1, 1869</a>). On June 25
                    Harry was married to Eva Wescott by Claudius W. Bradshaw, mayor of Camden. The
                    young man was accompanied by Whitman, who noted the fact in his diary and
                    referred to the bridegroom's "throat trouble." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
