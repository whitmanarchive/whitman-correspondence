                was no letter of mine in the paper or any paper, but a paragraph which I enclose to you written by the editor on 
                the basis of a private letter from me. I wrote to him on receipt of a letter from you saying that you wished money 
                to build on your Camden lot and paid board to your relatives. My motive was the necessity of saving you &amp; your 
                relatives from the degradation implied in Mr. Austin's<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">4</a> letter to the same paper in which he 
                said "While we talk, he starves"; to defend your American friends (such as Burroughs,<a href="#n0129" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0129">5</a> O 
                Connor,<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">6</a> myself &amp; others) from the outrageous insults heaped by that fellow 
                Buchanan<a href="#n0117" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0117">7</a> upon those of your countrymen who would share their last loaf with you; 
                and to free you from the charge of getting aid on false 
                pretences of which you were in danger, and myself from equal peril of abetting what I knew to be a lie by silence; 
                and you are not the man I take you for if you would have had me act otherwise. I can only suppose you have seen some 
                bungled &amp; mutilated telegram embodying part of the statement of which I now send you the whole.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You may remember that I talked to you in my bedroom about your circumstances, after I had conversed with your

            <p class="tei_p">In such matters as this the true thing is obviously the politic thing also. It is ludicrously false for Buchanan to 
                say that you are in danger of starving, or that you have no appreciation in America (where books have been written 
                about you, and where you have enthusiastic admirers!) Such absurd and false statements are sure to bring down contempt 
                on those who make them, and sometimes imperil the good fame of those about whom they are made.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your friends here are quite at one here on the subject, and Rossetti wrote to me that he knew 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Buchanans​ </span></span> statements 
                were "exaggerations", before I wrote to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">News</span>. The effort to circulate your books by 
                a subscription will be successful. Rossetti has had printed for private circulation your letter to him which gives 
                substantially the same account of your affairs which is contained in the paragraph of the Daily News enclosed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am much oppressed with work, &amp; cannot write letters. I trust this will find you improving in health. Pray 
                remember me kindly to Mr<a href="#n0700b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0700b">9</a> &amp; Mrs Whitman </p>

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
                    to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.

                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
