                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
