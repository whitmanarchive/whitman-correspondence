                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
                    Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry
                        Boy and the Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
                    their meetings in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story</span> (Boston: Houghton and
                    Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
                    11, 1863, Trowbridge presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman;
                    see Emerson's letter from <a href="nar.00002">January 10, 1863</a>. Though
                    Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to William D. O'Connor in
                    1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached
                    the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare"
                    (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American
                        Literature</span>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of
                    Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
