                best "To lift, how little howsoe'er, the hearts of toilers struggling here," would
                perhaps be a better idea than the one suggested in my previous letter. I should like
                to hear from you in response to either of these questions. A letter of one hundred
                words would perhaps be sufficiently long for this purpose.</p>
