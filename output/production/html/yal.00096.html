               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The letters arrive safe—I have received three—&amp; I am much obliged to you, Andy, for your attention. I am having good times here, rather quiet—My book is being printed—gets along rather slowly. I ride out on Long Island, &amp; up New York, Central Park, &amp;c. occasionally—the country is beautiful now—I take a walk on Broadway almost every afternoon—then sometimes a sail on the river or bay—so you see I am enjoying myself in my way—with three or four hours work every day reading my proofs, &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Andy, I suppose you are all getting along as usual—I enclose a line to Mat, which please give him—I send my love to you, Frank, Mat &amp; Lewis—&amp; for present, Farewell.</p>

            </span>
         
         
            <p class="tei_p">P.S. Andy, should any more letters come, you may direct them to me at 279 East 55th st. New York City—I expect to return about 12th Sept.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Finally, I must not neglect to impress upon your youthful mind—also upon that of Mr. F. Stitt—the original &amp; solemn advice, "Be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">virtuous</span>—&amp; you will be happy."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—from your Christian friend—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walter</span>.</p>
