               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt.</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">We have just received orders to cook three days rations and be ready to march immediately  I beleive the whole of the 9th Army Corps are ordered to report at Fortress Monroe. If so I suppose we will march to Aquia Creek, and go on board of Transports  My own oppinion is that Burnside is to collect a force at Fortress Monroe, and start off again on his own hook with a sepperate command. I wrote you a few days since, to send home for Mother to send you $20 by express and for you to bring it, when you came down here. Of course you will keep it, untill we get to some place where you can either send it by express or bring it yourself. We will probaly stay somewhere around Fortress Monroe for some time, if so you can take a run down there and see me,  I will write you as soon as we get there. I have my house nearly finished, and was going to have a nice warm place. Capt Sims left here yesterday for home on a leave of absence for 10 days. I was going to apply as soon as he came back and was makeing lots of reckoning of going home for a few days, but I suppose there will be no getting away now for some time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt, I have not received the letter you sent with the money, nor have I received any letter from you since the 27th of Jan. I wish you would write home telling them that we are going to leave here, as I dont know that I shall get a chance to write before we start. I will write to them as soon as we get to Fortress Monroe or wherever we may go. The mail is about closeing so I must stop. Good bye for the present</p>
