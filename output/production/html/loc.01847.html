            <p class="tei_p">Continued good-will well–supported by <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a constantly
                    enlarging</span> sense of your great merit as a writer fitted to both please and
                instruct, leads me to write this after quite a spell of silence. I can make it, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​ , only a sorry sort of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">an Appendix</span> to the series
                of letters I was sending you through the first half and seventh month of the year.
                The intention or one purpose of these letters being to divert or entertain you with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a
                    phase of life</span> that probably would not
                fail to be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">new</span> to you. As I have sometimes said during many years past, it is doubtful
                whether any one could imagine a human character so <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">strange</span>
                but that the wide world could furnish <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">one</span> specimen to fill its requirements—so, on the
                other hand, it is altogether possible for one individual to <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">exist</span> considerably or markedly different from all who can have
                come under the observation of any one man. And this is a good answer to those <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fools</span> who say there cannot be so much as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one perfectly honest</span> man on earth. I have said I was fully
                convinced there are men who would not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">yield their
                    integrity</span> for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">an endless life</span> and as much <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gold as half the bulk of the earth</span> with the other half to
                spend it on at present value—nor would they accept the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">throne</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prerogatives of God</span> on such condition
                (of being unjust).</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In your first letter (more than a year ago) you said you would "much, much" like to
                "look in upon" me—well, you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">have</span> looked in upon a
                real, live, "good enough" and also (by jingo!) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not too
                    good</span> a man—a sincere, enthusiastic admirerer, and yet in such told
                and untold particulars as we might differ about, a man "sufficient for himself" and
                whom laws, theories, conventions" and even <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">other</span>
                Philosophers and Poets <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">shall</span> not "master"—And so I ask
                you, did I not conduct my part of that correspondence rightly? For, naturally one

            <p class="tei_p">The autumn or October and November season, usually by far the loveliest of all the
                seasons here, has been much trespassed upon by spells of cloudy and rainy weather
                like our common <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">winter</span> weather—beyond any precedent.
                The sharp frosts just before and about Oct 15, coming before the forest foliage had
                matured enough to drop spontaneously, our superabundance of wildwood was clad two
                weeks ago with unusual, surpassing splendor and sweetness, but now, much of the
                glory is gone. Perhaps to the eye of a Poet and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">true</span>

                among the cotton rows, fingers busy with the beautiful and useful, and thoughts
                flying undisturbedly over all the earth in search of congenialities and
                reminiscences and then I am a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never so happy</span> diminutive

                    (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
                    rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
                    although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
                    When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01837">August 13,
                        1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
                    letter from <a href="loc.01838">September 13, 1874</a>: a former Rebel
                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
                    war he had been "a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slaveholding</span> youthful 'patriarch.'"
                    He informed Whitman in the <a href="loc.01837">August 13, 1874</a>, letter
                    that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                    Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                    that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                    Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                    profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                    after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
                    mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes with the usual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lack</span> of
                        <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">flowers</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fruit</span>." See
