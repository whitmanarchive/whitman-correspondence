                threatening rain, the sky has cleared up &amp; for a little time
                at least it promises to be fine. So in a few minutes I will walk

                his letter along with this.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am almost clear of my "cold" now, only my long confinement
                to the house has rather taken it out of me. And it makes it more
                difficult for me to get properly acclimatised again. For the wet,
                dull raw weather we are having here, with its variability,
                storms &amp; showers is a great change after the beautiful
                weather we had over there.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">However, I shall soon be all right again. I don't know when I had

                as this one has done. But the fact is that I got 2 or 3 colds
                in succession—first in the gale at sea &amp; then in my
                outdoor work in wretched weather.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote to Dr Bucke &amp; to Traubel's<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">5</a> yesterday.
                To the latter I have sent more detailed particulars of my voyage
                &amp; home coming—as requested by them—I wished afterwards
                that I had written them to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, in case
                they might interest you at all, but they hardly seemed worth
                while at the time. And I have written in a microscopic hand that
                is hardly readable.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Horace says that you refer to my American trip sometimes as
                "a triumph" for me. Anyhow it was a crowning good fortune.
                It is very wonderful to me when I consider how little
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> had to do with it, how it was shaped
                &amp; guided by external circumstances, &amp; how intimately it
                filled &amp; crowned so much that had preceded. I felt all through

                favoured.</p>

                Apart altogether from your books I have met you as
                man with man, friend with friend. And its result has been to confirm
                &amp; strengthen all the bonds which bound me to you before,

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
