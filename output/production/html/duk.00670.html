      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">This will show you that "the lamp still holds out to burn"—though I have had a bad two months past—I have had another paralytic stroke,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> but it passed over, without any thing serious, (it is probable 
        I have had several slight strokes)—but I am feeling, as I write, about the same as is now usual for me—still entertain expectations—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">If practicable I shall bring out a Vol. the coming summer—I hope to pay you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the visit</span> yet—Did you get the paper 
        I sent with a report of Emerson's late lecture on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eloquence</span>—of course interesting, from him, but nothing very stunning, 
        it seemed to me—I see that Conway is coming to America next autumn certain, to see things, travel, lecture, &amp;c—<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">John, [I] send you the last letter from a quondam correspondent &amp; unseen rebel friend of mine, 
        away down in Alabama<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—He seems to me a good affectionate fellow, a sort of uncut gem—I have had five or six letters from him, 
        all primitive but good—What are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> about?—&amp; how are you &amp; 'Sula getting along?

                    to Burroughs he had received, as he said, six letters from the colorful and
                    eccentric John Newton Johnson, a self-styled philosopher from rural Alabama.
                    There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C., but unfortunately there are no replies extant, although
                    Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years. When
                    Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01838">September 13,
                        1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," a former Rebel soldier with
                    an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the war he had
                    been "a youthful 'patriarch.'" He informed Whitman that during the past summer
                    he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and after a momentary
                    suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hung for
                        swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of Whitman's verse, and "I assure
                    you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting that the $3 book was worth
                    $50 if it could not be replaced. (Now Laugh)." He offered either to sell
                    Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all profits or to lend him money. In the
                    letter he enclosed a gold dollar: "So much grand poetry nearly kills me with the
                    pain of delight." Characteristically, he concluded his letter with an unexpected
                    question: "Walt! Are you Orthodox or Universalist? I am Materialist of late." On
                        <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>, after describing
                    Guntersville, Alabama, he commented: "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Orthodoxy</span>
                    flourishes with the usual <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lack</span> of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">flowers</span> or <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fruit</span>." His amusingly detailed
                    description of his face on <a href="loc.02386">November 7, 1875</a>,
                    Whitman marked in red crayon. Thus Johnson became a self-designated
                    philosophical jester to amuse Whitman. See also Charles N. Elliot, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and Friend</span> (Boston: R. G.
