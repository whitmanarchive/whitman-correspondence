        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John, &amp; 'Sula,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">This will show you that "the lamp still holds out to burn"—though I have had a bad two months past—I have had another paralytic stroke, but it passed over, without any thing serious, (it is probable 
        I have had several slight strokes)—but I am feeling, as I write, about the same as is now usual for me—still entertain expectations—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">If practicable I shall bring out a Vol. the coming summer—I hope to pay you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the visit</span> yet—Did you get the paper 
        I sent with a report of Emerson's late lecture on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eloquence</span>—of course interesting, from him, but nothing very stunning, 
        it seemed to me—I see that Conway is coming to America next autumn certain, to see things, travel, lecture, &amp;c——</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">John, [I] send you the last letter from a quondam correspondent &amp; unseen rebel friend of mine, 
        away down in Alabama—He seems to me a good affectionate fellow, a sort of uncut gem—I have had five or six letters from him, 
        all primitive but good—What are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> about?—&amp; how are you &amp; 'Sula getting along?
      </p>
