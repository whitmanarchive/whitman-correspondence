                Has a day past over my Head without me thinking of you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am also very glad to learn of Mrs. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Siter</span>s. I suppose she Has
                a Hard time of it. I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">recived​ </span></span> one letter from her and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Johnnys​ </span></span> Wife they wrote me rather a lamentable
                letter. Poor Jo Adams <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Im​ </span></span> sorry he is a fine fellow tell him I send him my <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">pies​ </span></span> regards and hope he will get well soon. Johnny Cahall I cant altogether
