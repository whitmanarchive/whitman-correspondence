            <p class="tei_p">Last year, in June '78. I was the means of introducing your book to a M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span> Alexander, in the North of Ireland. She wrote at that
                time to you, enclosing a money order for £1-6-0 for one of your books, I think
                the Two Rivulets. A couple of months afterwards I heard that she
                had never received any answer, &amp; after some time I wrote to my friend Professor
                Dowden<a href="#n0199" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0199">1</a> whom I knew to be in correspondence with you, asking him
                to mention the circumstance to you when he next wrote. I think he must have
                forgotten to do this, as I have heard again <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00175_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00175_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00175_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">man_ej.00175_large.jpg</span>today that M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span> Alexander has not received the book. Therefore I thought better to
                write to you myself, as having given her your address, &amp;c. I feel myself in a certain degree
                responsible. I heard that at the time you should have received her letter you were away
                from home. I concluded that the letter failed somehow to reach you. And it has also
                occurred to me that perhaps your last edition is out &amp; you have no more copies
                to send—or that you may have mislaid the letter &amp; address.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">So I should be much obliged if you would let me have a line today whether <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00176_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00176_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00176_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">man_ej.00176_large.jpg</span>you ever received

            <p class="tei_p">You have forgotten no doubt a letter I wrote you some years ago while an
                undergraduate in College, thanking you as deeply as I could find words to do for the
                spiritual health and thought I had found <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">or gained</span> in the Leaves of
                Grass. I cannot let this occasion pass without renewing my
                thanks, sending you again my greeting and love. Your book has travelled with me
                wherever I have gone. I have joined hands with you in it, tried to realize its
                ideals in my life; and to <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">lead</span> others to do so, often I am glad to say with success. homage like this you

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
