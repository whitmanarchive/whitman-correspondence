                        York Tribune</span> in the 1850s. Already divorced, she moved to Troy, New
                    York, to serve as secretary and companion to Emma Willard at the Women's
                    Seminary. Almost exactly six months after mailing this letter, Burr married a
                    third time, to William Henry Burleigh, a writer of Unitarian hymns and then
                    harbormaster of New York. After their marriage, Burr became active in the
                    women's suffrage movement and, after Burleigh's death in 1871, was ordained as a
                    minister in the Unitarian church. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
