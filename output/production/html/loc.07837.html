            <p class="tei_p">Perfect sunny day—am feeling pretty well—grip palpable tho'—(cold
                in the head feeling)—ate my breakfast with rather subdued appetite—bowel
                action this forenoon—miss Mrs: D[avis] 
                somewhat—call f'm my sister &amp; niece this mn'g—Ab't the Ingersoll affair I am in favor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York</span> decidedly, but it is probable they will have it in
                Phila:—there is some opposition to me or my
                cause being identified with I. wh' seems to make the special I[ngersoll] and
                freethinking folks more intense in identifying this W W affair with mark'd
                freethinking and non-orthodox (almost) passion—all of wh' is annoying to
                me—But I let the current move as it will or may, &amp; shall not
                meddle—but there are items ab't it that are not acceptable to me—for
                instance I do not like Col. I being solicited to do this as he appears to have
                been—of course it is not his fault in the least degree—Certainly I have
                neither prompted nor authorized any thing of the kind—I welcome him &amp;
                applaud him—he is a noble &amp; frank man, and I am proud of his endorsement
                &amp; advocacy, &amp; think that speech at the Reisser dinner one of the chief <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pinnacles</span> of my
                life—but I wince f'm any solicitation of that kind utterly—but enough of
                all that—I have just had a nice basket of seckel
                pears (f'm Prof: J McK Cattell, Penn. University) &amp;
                have sent some to old &amp; sick neighbors—(best tasting pears ever
                was)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1890-09-19">later P M</span>—the grip trouble is middling pronounced—sit here &amp; read
                &amp; write—day continues extra fine—am worried a good deal ab't a dear
                sister Mrs: Heyde (aged, sick, nervous) at Burlington Vermont a
                noble woman, her life (&amp; mine too) made miserable by the damndest whelp of a
                husband ever allow'd on earth (the snakes &amp; bed-bugs
                are not half as loathesome as some humans can be)—I call the H man <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whelp</span> altogether in my private letters—so you see I
                have some worries—</p>
