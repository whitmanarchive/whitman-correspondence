                <p class="tei_p"> A wish has suddenly and quite spontaneously sprung up in England amongst your
                    readers to in some part pay off the debt owed every poet &amp; especially to you. I hope
                    that you may see your way to letting this little bud blossom. I shall proceed no
                    further in this until I hear from you: trusting that you will not deprive
                    England of this honour. </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> I could not well write to you before as the scheme was so sudden and
                    spontaneous. </p>

                    call upon you in September. Wedmore is about the best critical writer in London
                    and quite the best of his kind. Although precise and neat his mind moves with
                    freedom as a candid mind should. Our friend is somewhat of a butterfly though I
                    have always found a staunch friend in Wedmore, in short I like him. </p>

                    I do not hear of your being there much. I am sorry Ruthie has married so

                    country. Her mother too has no one to help her. My mother's health is but sadly,

                    wonderful what she manages to do, continuing always to think and work for
                    others, herself last. My sister's voice is developing and her art is beginning
                    to be admired.<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">4</a> I am in excellent health and spirits. My
                    picture in this year's Royal Academy was a good deal noticed, and has done my
                    reputation good: in fact I am getting on my feet, slowly. I am rather hankering
                    after a studio right down in the city amongst men: From a business point of view
                    it is fatal not be central, and besides I love the Strand, Oh! how you would

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
