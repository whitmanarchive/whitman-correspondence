                <p class="tei_p"> A wish has suddenly and quite spontaneously sprung up in England amongst your
                    readers to in some part pay off the debt owed every poet &amp; especially to you. I hope
                    that you may see your way to letting this little bud blossom. I shall proceed no
                    further in this until I hear from you: trusting that you will not deprive
                    England of this honour. </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> I could not well write to you before as the scheme was so sudden and
                    spontaneous. </p>

                <p class="tei_p"> I think that you will like Wedmore, he is coming to
                    call upon you in September. Wedmore is about the best critical writer in London
                    and quite the best of his kind. Although precise and neat his mind moves with
                    freedom as a candid mind should. Our friend is somewhat of a butterfly though I
                    have always found a staunch friend in Wedmore, in short I like him. </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> I fear me that you do not take such pleasure in Glendale as you did in Kirkwood
                    I do not hear of your being there much. I am sorry Ruthie has married so
                        young, it means a long hard life probably in the
                    country. Her mother too has no one to help her. My mother's health is but sadly,
                    but it is <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02188.02_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02188.02_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02188.02_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                    wonderful what she manages to do, continuing always to think and work for
                    others, herself last. My sister's voice is developing and her art is beginning
                    to be admired. I am in excellent health and spirits. My
                    picture in this year's Royal Academy was a good deal noticed, and has done my
                    reputation good: in fact I am getting on my feet, slowly. I am rather hankering
                    after a studio right down in the city amongst men: From a business point of view
                    it is fatal not be central, and besides I love the Strand, Oh! how you would
                    too, sort of human Delaware river. </p>

                    view to presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The
                    poet is in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some
                    years ago from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis,
                    maintained himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose,
                    and by occasional contributions to magazines. Mr. Herbert H. Gilchrist, 12, Well
                    Road, Hampstead, acts as honorary and corresponding secretary to this scheme;
                    Mr. Rossetti, 5, Endsleigh Gardens, Euston Square, as
                    treasurer. </p>
