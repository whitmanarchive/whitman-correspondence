                    April 21 and May 3, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter only to spring
                    1873, and it is not clear whether Edwin Haviland Miller assigned it a date (Walt
                    Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). The letter indicates that Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman wrote on a Monday, and it dates to late April or to early May
                    1873. The earliest possible date, though unlikely, is after April 13, 1873
                    (Sunday), the day on which news of the so-called "Modoc Massacre," the
                    assassination of General Edward R. S. Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas, was
                    published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span>. Louisa refers to having
                    learned of those events "last" Sunday from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>.
                    Her phrase may mean either the most recent Sunday (April 13) or the one
                    following, so the letter could also date after April 21, 1873 (Monday). However,
                    another phrase, if in echo of an extant letter from Walt Whitman, could date the
                    letter even later. Louisa wrote, "you dident write how you was particularly that
                    you was abou[t?] the same." The phrase, a familiar refrain in both Walt's and
                    Louisa's letters, echoes Walt's <a href="yal.00415">April 30, 1873</a>
                    letter: "I am about the same." In sum, Louisa's letter is near certain to date
                    to no earlier than April 21, the Monday a week after news of the Modoc Massacre
                    was first reported on April 13, 1873. However, Louisa's phrase "abou[t?] the
                    same"—unless in echo of a non-extant earlier letter—is likely to
                    follow Walt's April 30, 1873 letter. As both a non-extant letter from Walt with
                    a familiar phrase and confusion about how many Sundays have passed since a
                    widely covered story was first reported are quite possible, the letter is
                    assigned a range from April 21 to May 3, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00629_n5 note" id="duk.00629_n5"><span>Walt Whitman after his

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward had shared the Brooklyn
                    residence with Jeff and Mattie's family until Jeff departed for St. Louis.
                    Mattie died on February 19, 1873 (see Jeff's February 24, 1873 letter to Louisa

                    <p class="tei_p">George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                        George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                        the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
                        Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                        Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
                        and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
                        later a mason named French. George also took a position as inspector of
                        pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam in spring
                        1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to reside
                        with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see

                    (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Louisa Orr in April 1873 was believed
                    pregnant, and she began to spend entire days upstairs without descending (see
                    Louis Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00624">April 8, 1873</a> letter to
                    Walt). Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was displeased with the
                    living arrangement and confided many frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her
                    letters to Walt. She never developed the close companionship with Lou that she
                    had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n15">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00628_n15 note" id="duk.00628_n15"><span>The "aunt" who was engaged

                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913), who, with
                    Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates
                    during the Washington years. Before marrying William O'Connor, Ellen Tarr was
                    active in the antislavery movement as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and in the women's rights movements as a contributor to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Nelly had a close personal relationship with
                    Whitman, and correspondence between Whitman and Nelly is almost as voluminous as
                    the poet's correspondence with William. Nelly also helped nurse Whitman after
                    his paralytic stroke in January 1873. For more on Whitman's relationship with

                    Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
                    Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
                    contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his

                    the day, the "Modoc Massacre" was the unprovoked assassination of General Edward
                    R. S. Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas and the wounding of Oregon Indian
                    Superintendent Alfred Meacham during negotiation between the United States Army
                    and the Modoc tribe led by Kientpoos (?–1873), known as "Captain Jack."
                    Canby sought the return of the Modoc people to a reservation occupied by the
                    Klamath people, an historical enemy of the Modocs. Protected in their stronghold
                    of the Lava Beds, Kientpoos and his fellow Modocs sought to remain near Lost
                    River. Canby and Thomas, part of a Peace Commission that Ulysses S. Grant formed
                    in an effort to end the standoff, went to the peace negotiation with the Modocs
                    unarmed. They were killed on April 11, 1873. For the initial report that Louisa
