                    was the son of Henry Wilson (1805–1870)—a harness and trunk maker—and
                    Ann S. Williams Wilson (1809–1887). Benton Wilson was a U. S. Civil War soldier recovering in Armory Square Hospital 
                    in Washington, D.C., when he met Whitman. Later, Wilson was employed selling melodeons and sewing machines. He also
                    sold life insurance and may have worked as a pawnbroker. He married 
                    Nellie Gage Morrell Wilson (ca. 1841–1892). Nellie had two children, Lewis
                    and Eva Morrell, from a previous marriage, and she and Benton were the parents of five children.
                    Wilson named his first child "Walter Whitman Wilson," after the poet; their other
                    children were Austin, Irene, Georgie, and Kathleen Wilson. Benton Wilson's
                    correspondence with Whitman spanned a decade, lasting from 1865 to 1875. </span></span> [<a href="#r0810b">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01987_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01987_n6"><span>Nellie E.

                    attempting to attain a patent (which is likely related to the
                    "experiment" Henry discusses here): "When he left here he said he was going to
                    New York as agent for a firm in this city &amp; the next we hear of him he is in
                    Washington trying to get some Patent which we would be very glad if he would
                    come home &amp; let it alone." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
