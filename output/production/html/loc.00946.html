            <p class="tei_p">Your letter to Wm. of July 24. he forwarded to me in a letter that I got last evening.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> How glad I was to get it, and to know that you are so much better. I hope you still continue to gain, I hope you are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">well,</span> but I do not really expect you to be wholly well until the cool autumn days come, that I so dread, &amp; shrink from.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very glad to get this letter, dear Walt, for I had really begun to wonder why you had so wholly forgotten me.

After seeing you every day, &amp; so much of you those last days when you were sick, it seems doubly strange not to have had a word from you. You will not think me foolish if I tell you that it hurt me a little, will you? You know what a foolish, absurd person I am, where I love anyone as I do you, and knowing this, and now I having confessed, you will pardon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did you like my picture?

            <p class="tei_p">I am so glad that there is some hope of your book coming out soon. I long to see it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Just think, Walt, of my being a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lion</span> down here on your account, because it is known that I have the honor of your acquaintance.

I have been here two weeks, &amp; am so brown that I could easily pass for a good "contraband," I nearly live out doors. The rocks tempt me, &amp; there I sit &amp; see the waves &amp; foam dash up over them, &amp; it breaks into fine spray, &amp; is so beautiful. I never <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">loved</span> the sea so much, &amp; I though before I loved it more than any <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">thing.</span>  How I wish you were here!

                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
                    Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
                    intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
                    clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
                    however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
                    on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00946_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_revised tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00946_n2"><span>In December 1862, on his
                    way to visit George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington
                    and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk in the office of the
                    army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George had not been severely
                    wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his home until 1873.
                    Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the
                    army paymaster. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00946_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00946_n3"><span>Charles Joseph Howells,
                    according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
                    perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
                    an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
                    in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00946_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00946_n4"><span>Juliette H. Beach was one
                    of those enigmatic women associated with Whitman about whom imaginative
                    biographers have spun ingenious theories. Beach was to have reviewed the 1860
                    edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>, but when her husband's unfavorable review was
                    published instead, the journal had to take public note of matrimonial discord in
                    order to correct the error (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary
                        Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</span> [New York: Macmillan,
                    1955; rev. ed., New York University Press], 260-262). Ellen O'Connor contributed
                    her bit to the theory that Beach and Whitman had a love affair when she asserted
                    that "Out of the Rolling Ocean, the Crowd," published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, was composed for "a certain lady" who had angered her
                    husband because of her correspondence with the poet (Emory Holloway, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</span> [Garden
                    City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921], 1:lviii). "Mrs. Beach's notes" may be
                    the letters to Whitman, which later Burroughs vainly asked Mrs. Beach to print;
                    see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life and Letters of John Burroughs</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1925), 1:120. If these were love letters, Whitman
                    hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings discreetly. See also Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>, 340–342. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
