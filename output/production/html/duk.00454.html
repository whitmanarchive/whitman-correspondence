                I remember Bryant. You once brought him to my studio in Brooklyn. 
                I can imagine or recall him now,
                as he sat on the extreme end of my lounge—High Priest of Nature! Thanatopsis! 
                Durand essayd to color the theme from his rather
                weak (never vain palette.) A failure. The grand old rocks, ancient as the sun! 
                ["]very new rocks" wrote one critic.
                Cole might, could have portrayd it, with his dramatic power!

                for ourselves, life's subsistence—our

                by good mother Whitmans presence, years ago, for a brief so-journ—and
