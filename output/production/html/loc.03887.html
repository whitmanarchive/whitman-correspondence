            <p class="tei_p">I sent Harry the Doctor's address (131 South 15th street)
                last Sunday evn'g,—so he must have got it next day—We had a fine visit Sunday,
                &amp; I enjoyed the drive very much—&amp; you dont know how much good I have
                had out of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that
                chicken</span>—I have had three meals out of it—a bit
                broiled—&amp; am to have the rest stewed for dinner to-day—it was sweet
                &amp; tender—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am ab't as usual—havn't been anywhere (though several invitations)—I
                keep good spirits, but grow clumsier &amp; clumsier, &amp; my sight is giving
                out—I enclose one of Herbert's last letters—(I had written to him over a month ago, when you were not very
                well)—By it, he is not likely to come to America this fall—Cool &amp;
                bright weather as I write—Love to you &amp; George &amp; Ed—</p>
