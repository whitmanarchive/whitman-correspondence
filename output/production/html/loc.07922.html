                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry
                    and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
                    known. See Andrew C. Higgins, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    inspired by Whitman. In his <a href="loc.07357">August 20–22,
                        1890</a>, letter, Bucke remarked: "The whole article is 'flat, stale and

                    shell, the superfices, never for one line, one flash of insight penetrating to

                    Whitman observed: "you are a little more severe on Symonds than I sh'd

                    the latter he averred that Emerson told him Whitman appeared coatless at a
                    dinner party (128). The poet denied the accusation in an unsigned article in the
                    Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Post</span> on August 12, which he reprinted, again
                    anonymously, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's</span> in March, 1891; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span> (1888), 774–775. Bucke
                    commented on the matter on <a href="loc.07356">August 17</a>: "These
                    foolish, would be visions, lies, &amp; liars will one day come to an
                    end—in the meantime I do not know but they do more good than
                    harm—Keep things stirred up." Woodbury also praised Whitman both in the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> (625) and in his book (62–63). On <a href="duk.00387">February 21, 1866</a>, Woodbury, then twenty-one years
                    old, wrote an exuberant letter to Whitman in which he averred that "Emmerson did
                    not say the best things." For his retraction, see Whitman's letter to Bucke of

                    of the poet on the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom,

                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
