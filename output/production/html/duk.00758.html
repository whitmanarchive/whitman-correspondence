                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Tom</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter has just come all right &amp; I am glad to hear from you again. Every
                thing seems to go lovely there with you &amp; the boys &amp; Dr B (which is as
                it should be)—Tom, I often think of you all, &amp; of the last night we all
                got together, &amp; of the friendly parting drink we all had out there on the
                lawn—seems as if I only got to know you &amp; all best &amp; then time for me
                to clear out—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have some good times here in moderation—I cant go around very lively, but I
                enjoy what's going on wherever I go—This 31st of May coming I shall be
                62—but thank the Lord I still feel young at heart &amp; cheery as
                ever—After I returned last fall from Canada I was first rate all
                along—put in four good months—had some rare old times—will tell
                you when we meet, Tom—but some six weeks ago was careless enough to get badly
                chill'd all through my whole body, &amp; repeated the next day—So I have been
                since quite under the weather—But I am getting over it &amp; feeling quite
                myself again—I find I can be well enough if I take very particular care of
                myself, how I go, &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">An old doctor here said to me "Whitman you are like an old wagon, built of first rate
                stuff, &amp; the best sort of frame &amp; wheels &amp; nuts—&amp; as long as
                you are mighty careful, &amp; go slow, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Keep to good
                    roads</span>, you will last as long as any of us—but if you get on bad
                roads, or cut up any capers, then <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">look out</span>"—I go down
                every week or two (I go tomorrow again) about 20 miles from here right into the
                country, with a family of farmers, dear friends of mine, named Stafford—Keep a
                country store also—a big family of boys &amp; girls, &amp; Mrs S one of the
                kindest &amp; best women in the world—how much happier one can be when there
                is good women around—Does me good to be with them all. Every thing is very old
                fashioned, just suits me—good grub &amp; plenty of it. My great loafing place
                out there is a big old woods, mostly pine &amp; oak, but lots of laurel &amp; holly,
                old paths &amp; roads every where through the thick woods—I spend hours there
                every day—have it all to myself—go out there well-protected, even in a
                snow storm—rabbits &amp; squirrels, &amp; lots of birds beginning
                already—Tom, you would laugh to see me the way I amuse myself, often spouting
                terrible pieces Shakspere or Homer as loud as I can yell. (But that always was a
                favorite practice of mine—I used to do it in the din of Broadway New York from
                the top of an omnibus—at other times along the seashore at Coney
                Island)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tom, my paper is <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="filled​ ">fill'd</span>​  &amp; I must close—I wanted to write something about
                the running &amp; matches, but must postpone it—Give my love to all my friends
                there &amp; you yourself, dear boy—</p>
