                    store—William Ingram and Son Tea Dealers—in Philadelphia. Of Ingram,
                    Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "He is a man of the Thomas Paine
                    stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
                    alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of
                    prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">Sunday, May 20, 1888</a>).

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the
                    Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until
                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in
