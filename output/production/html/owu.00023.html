                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Here is William Ingram's letter—forwarded at his request to you—He
                comes to see me occasionally &amp; is always welcome—John's good letter
                was rec'd this forenoon &amp; is cheery &amp; hospitable as always—Yes my dear friend if I get 
                able again to get about—&amp; you settle down &amp; the machinery moves regularly &amp;c.—I 
                may come to New York &amp; see you all—We will see how the cat jumps—I still remain in 
                my sick room—tho' I have had no set back any thing worth mentioned,—but remain very enfeebled
                &amp; almost helpless in strength of legs &amp; body, without improvement at all.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—This week so 
                far the temperature has been just right here—My little booklet November Boughs is ab't 
                done—will make 140 pages—I have for the concluding one a disjointed paper on 
                "Elias Hicks"—the publication will be delayed yet a number of weeks—I 
                am sitting up in my big arm chair writing this—am comfortable—Best love to you all.</p>
