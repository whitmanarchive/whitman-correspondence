                <span class="tei_salute">Dear son,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am only able to write the same old story—since I last wrote, I have had some
                pretty bad spells—suffered at intervals all last week, &amp; yesterday, with
                the strange &amp; painful distress in the head, I have had so much of—But I
                feel better to-day—Every time I feel better, I find myself much
                encouraged—I still stick here, as I dont dare to trust myself in a strange place, if I can help it. </p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01743.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01743.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01743.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter telling me you was too late to get any chance for the letter
                carrier's position—&amp; about Mr. Noyes' friendliness—Are things just the same, as far as
                you and your crew, are concerned?—I think about you every night—I reproach
                myself, that I did not fly around when I was well, &amp; in Washington, to find some
                better employment for you—now I am here, crippled, laid up for God knows how
                long, unable to help myself, or my dear boy—I do not miss any thing of
                Washington here, but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your visits</span>—if I could only have a
                daily visit here, such as I had there—</p>
            
            
            
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01743.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01743.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01743.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I go out very little here—there is not much convenience here, for me to go
                out—one car line, passing about two squares off, consists of 4 cars, running
                semi-occasionally—and another line, about 3½ squares the other way, has
                I believe 6 or 7 cars—I get out &amp; take a ride in them sometimes—my
                best jaunt is going in them to the ferry, &amp; crossing on the boat to
                Philadelphia, to &amp; fro, several times—But a great portion of the time I do
                not feel able to go out alone—fortunately I do not have any dizzy spells, nor
                any symptoms of them, so far,—so I am not worried about that, when I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">am</span> out—As I write this, it is a very pleasant cool
                    afternoon, &amp; I am sitting here by the window in a big easy chair</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete I hope this will find you feeling well, &amp; in good spirits—Write me a
                good long letter, &amp; tell me every thing—it will do you good——how does
                the new time go on the road, since Baltimore tunnel connection?—how about
                Washington—Tasistro—everybody?—get a good sheet of paper, &amp;
                sit down in the park, with your lead pencil—I send you an envelope—also
                some one cent stamps—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Love to you dear boy—Keep up a good heart—I do yet—though it is a
                long &amp; hard pull sometimes with me lately. </p>
