            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I still remain well—Am out here in Concord on a visit—spent last evening with Mr Emerson very pleasantly indeed—am to take dinner with him
                to-day—Every thing very agreeable here—I am at F B
                Sanborn's—(the little picture at the top is the house)—as I write (Sunday forenoon 11 o'clock) I look out
                on the Concord river—something like the Schuylkill—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The book is almost finished—I am on the last pages of the proof—will be
                ready in the stores <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  last of October—will be issued first in England, to secure the
                copyright there—as that is required, &amp; I consider it important—Shall
                leave here (Boston) in about ten days—(perhaps less)—expect to stop in New York probably a week or so, &amp; then on
                home—I sent your letter to Mrs. Gilchrist—I have not written
                yet—it is so sudden &amp; dreadful—I thought
                I would wait a while—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter &amp; as always was glad to get it—it is a sunny, Indian
                summery spell of weather here now, cool enough, but just suits me—I go back to
                Boston probably to-morrow—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Yes I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  the wedding invitation cards from Mr [&amp;] Mrs Elverson for Alice &amp; the happy (proposed)
                bride groom—I think him a lucky man—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well I must close at once, for here comes a fine lively team of white horses to take
                me out to ride, to be driven by the owner, Miss Mann,
                herself—With love as always—</p>
