                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">When I arrived home yesterday I found my brother worse than I had anticipated.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> It is a case of malignant erysipelas, with great swelling,
                sores, &amp; for a while complete blindness, now partially relieved. There are
                spells also of lethargy &amp; flightiness—all bad enough, yet, as far as the
                case stands at this present writing, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">he will come out safe</span>, I
                somehow feel <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">certain</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother is well as usual—defers every thing else, &amp; does the nursing,
                &amp;c. for George. When I came, yesterday, I found her standing with a cup of warm
                tea, feeding slowly with a spoon, to some one wrapt in a great blanket, &amp; seated
                in an arm chair, by the stove—I did not recognize my brother at
                first—he was so disfigured, &amp; the features out of all proportion &amp;
                discolored. Mother put down the cup, &amp;c. &amp; began to cry—this affected
                poor George—yet I preserved my composure, though much distrest, as you will
                understand.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The rest of the family are well. Jeff leaves to-morrow evening for St. Louis. It is
                cold here, with raw easterly wind. I met Henry Clapp<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> in Broadway yesterday—he has a $1500 clerkship in a public office
                in New York—I met Edward H. House
<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>—also other of my young men friends—they are all very, very
                cordial &amp; hospitable—I shall go over &amp; make Mrs. Price a short visit
                this afternoon. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">They all talk of you here—as of the good person, the desired one, exhilarating,
                whose presence gives sun, &amp; whose talk nourishes—(I think you must have
                laid yourself out that evening.)<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, I send you my love—also to Charles Eldridge—shall probably
                remain here the ensuing week. </p>

                    that George Washington Whitman was not well, but was still able to go to work;
                    she did not indicate the gravity of his illness. She was upset by all the
                    turmoil involved in Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's moving. Martha, Jeff's
                    wife, somewhat impulsively, sold all the furnishings "and spent the money as
                    fast as it came in for clothes to go in the country." Under the circumstances,
                    since the family desperately needed some one who could "take things coolly," it
                    is understandable that Walt Whitman decided to hurry to Brooklyn. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00263_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00263_n4"><span>
                    <p class="tei_p">Henry Clapp (1814–1875) was one of Walt Whitman's intimates from the
                        Pfaffian days. Restless and adventurous, Clapp roamed to Paris, returned in
                        the 1840s to Lynn, Massachusetts, to edit the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Essex County
                            Washington</span> (later <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Pioneer</span>), and
                        eventually went to New York, where he became "king of the Bohemians." As
                        editor of the short-lived <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>
                        (1858–1860; 1865–1866), he printed <a href="per.00071">"A
                            Child's Reminiscence"</a> ("Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"),
                        and, in 1860, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00035.html">praised <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span></a> when others
                        condemned it; see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary
                            Singer</span> (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1955), 242–244,
                        260–261. "Henry Clapp," Walt Whitman said to Horace Traubel, "stepped
                        out from the crowd of hooters—was my friend: a much needed ally at
                        that time (having a paper of his own) when almost the whole press of America
                        when it mentioned me at all treated me with derision or worse. If you ever
                        write anything about me in which it may be properly alluded to I hope you
                        will say good things about Henry Clapp" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.63.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996], 1:236).
                        In his reply to Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.01812">May 9, 1867</a>,
                        O'Connor was amused that Clapp was "becoming a respectable citizen. When
                        once a man enters upon the downward path, &amp;c.…one can see as the
                        guilty result of Bohemianism, a place in the Common Council or Board of
                        Aldermen!"</p>

                        referred to in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00267">September 15, 1867</a>

                    <p class="tei_p">Edward Howard House (1836–1901) was music and drama critic of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Courier</span> from 1854 to 1858, and was appointed
                        to the same post on the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> in 1858.
                        Walt Whitman evidently knew House as early as 1857, for, in his "Autograph
                        Notebook—1857" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                        Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), he pasted
                        a calling card signed by House. During the Civil War, House was a war
                        correspondent for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">At this time House was not with the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>;
                        he was engaged in theatrical management in New York and London.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00263_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00263_n6"><span>O'Connor, much flattered
                    by this paragraph, compared himself to "a young girl finding herself beloved or
                    admired by some one unsuspected before." In the same letter of <a href="loc.01812">May 9, 1867</a>, he went on to describe how deeply
                    Whitman's mother "affected" him: "Her cheerfulness, her infinite gentleness and
                    tenderness, were like the deep smile of the evening sky. As I saw her that
                    night, with the children on each side, and each leaning a head upon her, I
                    thought of the Madonna grown old." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
