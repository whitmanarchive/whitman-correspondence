                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">When I arrived home yesterday I found my brother worse than I had anticipated. It is a case of malignant erysipelas, with great swelling,
                sores, &amp; for a while complete blindness, now partially relieved. There are
                spells also of lethargy &amp; flightiness—all bad enough, yet, as far as the
                case stands at this present writing, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">he will come out safe</span>, I
                somehow feel <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">certain</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother is well as usual—defers every thing else, &amp; does the nursing,
                &amp;c. for George. When I came, yesterday, I found her standing with a cup of warm
                tea, feeding slowly with a spoon, to some one wrapt in a great blanket, &amp; seated
                in an arm chair, by the stove—I did not recognize my brother at
                first—he was so disfigured, &amp; the features out of all proportion &amp;
                discolored. Mother put down the cup, &amp;c. &amp; began to cry—this affected
                poor George—yet I preserved my composure, though much distrest, as you will
                understand.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The rest of the family are well. Jeff leaves to-morrow evening for St. Louis. It is
                cold here, with raw easterly wind. I met Henry Clapp in Broadway yesterday—he has a $1500 clerkship in a public office
                in New York—I met Edward H. House
—also other of my young men friends—they are all very, very
                cordial &amp; hospitable—I shall go over &amp; make Mrs. Price a short visit
                this afternoon. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">They all talk of you here—as of the good person, the desired one, exhilarating,
                whose presence gives sun, &amp; whose talk nourishes—(I think you must have
                laid yourself out that evening.)
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, I send you my love—also to Charles Eldridge—shall probably
                remain here the ensuing week. </p>
