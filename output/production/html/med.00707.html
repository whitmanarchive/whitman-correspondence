            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I arrived here last night, ill and exhausted. The parting at
                Providence was hard. I fear I shall never see Jeannie
                well again.</p>

                time in the cars reading the
                proof, which I herewith return corrected. I have followed your wishes, and made only
                verbal corrections, which I wish you would see carried out carefully by the printer,
                as I know you will.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Of course I yield about the paragraphs, although I can't think I shall ever like
                them. No

                matter: the text is the main thing, and every consideration is swallowed up
                in the consciousness that you like what I have written—that you feel that my
                utterance has power, and fills the bill. I hope, for your sake, that the public will
                think so also.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My principal corrections—the ones I feel specially desirous to have

                made are as follows:</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I. Page 78. Small k in the word "knights. The obstinate printer has twice made this
                a large <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">K</span>, the effect of which is absurd.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">II. Page 82. "Quaternion," not "qua<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>ternion."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">III. Page 82. "Irresponsible." The allusion, which is one George William will keenly
                feel, is to Tennyson's "O irresponsible, indolent reviewers,"
                which is very witty, and sticks to the tribe like a burr.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">IV. Page 86. "And it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span> grand." I think italicising "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span>," helps the sense.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">V. Page 92. I hope I don't bother the printer, but the change here is necessary, for
                this is the passage I wrote you about, and I don't want to be picked up by some
                malevolent reviewer. Please see to this yourself, if you can. It should read "to
                ride with bared head in the warm and perfumed rains of Spring that he might feel
                upon him, he said, the universal spirit of the world." (How this anecdote reveals
                the poet in Bacon!—how it allies him to the Shakespeare literature!)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">VI. Page 94. I am not sure I understand the printer's mark here. But there should be
                a paragraph—which I think the fiend tried to abolish.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">VII. Page 95. "Furthest," not "furtherest," good printer-devil!</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Good Gray Poet.</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">VIII. Bucke sent me my foot-note, and I have made the change
                (Page 100.). I think it better, and the five words which commence it, are a blow at
                    Lowell, planted straight home.</p>

                out Munro's name. I don't
                know how I ever made such a blunder. Munro's translation (prose) is really admirable
                for courage and fidelity, so far as I can judge</p>
            <p class="tei_p">X. Page 124. For heaven's sake, make the diabolical printer-man restore the two
                articles—"the" and "the"—to their proper places! The effect of the
                sentence is ruined by their elision.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The remaining corrections are trifles.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I'll write again soon. This is hurried, to go off

                with the proof, which I don't want
                to delay.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Bucke wrote me to find an epigraph for the appendix—leaving the matter entirely
                to me!!! So you didn't make anything by soliciting him. As yet I have not been able
                to think of anything—in fact, I have been in too much trouble to think
                effectually—that is to give my mind to it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">More anon. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Have</span> you seen Grant White's article in the Atlantic
                for April on the Bacon-Shakespeare craze? It is rich. Supercilious ass!</p>
