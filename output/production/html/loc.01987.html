            <p class="tei_p">your letter of the 10<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> of January
                was received more than a week ago and should have been answered before this time but
                I have not been in the humor of writing and have kept putting it off till some more
                convenient season but I will try to be more punctual in the future.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Father is staying with me again and he borrowed "Leaves of
                Grass," for me of Dr. Hawley for a few days and was very
                much interested in it, but I <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01478_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01478_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01478_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> will be candid with you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think on the start I was more interested in it because it was your work, than for
                the good sentiments it contained, but as I got more acquainted with it I liked it
                for its own value, although I can not understand all of it I can not find anything
                indecent about it. But my kind Old Friend you must not think that because I wrote to
                you and mentioned it, that I wish you to send me the Book for that is not what I
                intended for you to think.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I wrote to you a year and more ago that I was married but did not receive any reply

                Business with a partner at manufacturing Parlor Brackets a little over a year ago
                and continued at it about six or Seven months and lost about one thousand dollars
                and found myself in debt six hundred dollars and finally came to the conclusion that
                it was time I closed up my business, so I did so about the first of July last, and
                am now at work at my trade in a Piano Forte &amp; Melodeon
                Manufactory and find that it pays me better than business on my own book. Now I
                think I have given you a good statement of my situation and hope it will be to your
                satisfaction</p>

                had any History except what we have got in the house, because I have not had access
                to the Libraries, but if you will write what history I shall get, I will get a
                library ticket and try to get them. History is my favorite reading</p>
