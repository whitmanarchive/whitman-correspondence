            <p class="tei_p">Thanks, thanks indeed, dear friend—to yourself, Mr Roberts, Bessie and Isabella
                Ford, C R Ashbee, Wm Thompson, &amp; brother &amp;
                sister, for the kind &amp; generous birthday gift—for your letter with the
                £45 which has just reached me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have fine weather here, &amp; I am enjoying it—My health remains nearly as
                usual, but there is a little decline &amp; additional feebleness every successive
                year—as is natural.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Staffords are all living and well—I drive down there Sundays &amp; they
                often speak of you. Harry (at Marlton, New Jersey)—and Ruth (in Kansas) are some time married, &amp; have
                children.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you &amp; to B[essie] and I[sabella] F[ord]—</span>
