                have probably seen the card lying about since you sent the letter) yet I judge from
                the tenor of what you say that your O'C. is very sick. You will
                feel bad about it I know and it is very natural you should still it is my decided

                gladly see O'Connor well yet (that being out of the question, I fear) the next best
                thing I think will be for him to leave us. Poor fellow! it will only be a very
                little while untill we rejoin him and we will settle then whether the whole thing
                was or was not well planned! I am glad to hear that they are looking up a chair <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00580.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00580.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00580.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>for you. If (having a chair) you were living in a cottage with a
                lawn, trees &amp;c &amp;c. and living on the ground floor (as might all be arranged
                well enough) there is no reason why you should not spend a good part of your time
                during the summer in your chair on the grass, under the trees, among the flowers.
                You are not tied to one house (and that about the worst house and the worst situated
                that could be found for you) and there is no reason at all why you should not go
                where you would have the surroundings you need. Why not
                get Horace to look about for a good cottage for you? I hope to
                see you before a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very</span> great while</p>
