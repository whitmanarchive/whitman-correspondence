                    George Chainey, the publisher of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">This World</span> (Boston), in
                    Boston in 1881. On December 22, 1881, the poet sent one of Chainey's sermons to
                    Susan Stafford (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                    the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                    D.C.). Chainey printed on June 17, 1882, "Keep Off the Grass," a lecture which
                    he had delivered on June 11, as well as "To a Common Prostitute." Chainey
                    printed Whitman's letter and one from O'Connor on July 1. Interestingly,
                    O'Connor deplored Chainey's stupidity in a letter to Whitman on <a href="loc.03061">July 13</a>, although he had been furnishing Chainey
                    with information; see Chainey's letter to O'Connor, dated July 11 (Trent
                    Collection, Duke University). Chainey discussed the censorship on July 1, July
                    6, and November 4; see Roger Asselineau, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">L'Évolution de Walt
                        Whitman</span> (1955), 250–251n. Chainey lectured on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1884 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, June 23). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
