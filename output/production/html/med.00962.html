            <p class="tei_p">During the last six days every body here has been agog
                with the Buffalo Convention, and matters thereunto
                appertaining. It seems that seventeen States had delegations there—Ohio by
                hundreds, and New York by thousands.—From the reports, there were some fifty
                thousand person assembled, about one-third of whom were delegates. Judge McLean withdrew in the beginning. Senator Hale's friends, however, rallied a very respectable vote for
                him, but not quite enough to take the game; whereupon they gave in with a good
                grace, and Van Buren was ratified by acclamation.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Much astonishment is felt, however, at the nomination for
                the Vice Presidency. Very few people had hitherto heard of Charles Francis Adams—except, perhaps, in the demesnes of Boston, where
                he has occupied, for years past, a position among the editorial corps. What the
                reasons of bringing him forward are, do not as yet appear upon the surface. The
                managing men at Buffalo, however, had some good reasons in their own minds, no
                doubt. McLean or Hale had been generally fixed upon for the station.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">O, what a ferment we are in! The impetus from Buffalo has
                come five hundred miles to us, and little is talked of in the streets and public
                places generally, but the three tickets. Taylor has
                many firm friends here, notwithstanding the heavy ground-swell that sets in from
                certain quarters against him. Cass, I judge from what I
                hear and see, is least likely to carry New York of any of the candidates. Indeed,
                the shrewdest politicians do not count this State for the regular Democratic
                nominees at all.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Very many of the "good society" of the town are off to
                watering places, and spots all along shore, and some of them in the woods. They are
                having high times, I see, at Saratoga. Down at Rockaway, and off at Newport, also,
                balls, pic-nics, jollity, courting, promenading, etc., form the happy employment of
                some five thousand, probably more, happy dogs. Happy did I say? Well, who knows that
                they are any happier than we who are comfortably staying at home, and don't stir out
                during the three hours on each side of meridian line?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is a report in town that Gen. Worth has arrived—he of the "waving plume." He should
                have come hereafter, or else a couple of months earlier. Just about now, he won't
                find people disposed to pay anybody much attention, except he come to them talking
                politics. The gallant General wrote a gratuitous letter to act on the Baltimore
                    Convention, in which the desire for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">something</span> stood out so prominently that even he who ran might
                read what he, the General, so very much wanted. This letter-writing has killed
                better men than Worth; and it has cooled the ardor of the friends of the latter
                exceedingly. It is every way to be hoped, however, that the gallant General will be
                received by his fellow citizens with due honor and courtesy; for he bore himself
                valiantly and wisely in the field.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Trist's violent and
                passionate attack on the President does not receive much serious attention. The
                Ex-Commissioner overleaps the mark in his fury, and charges too much on his
                extensively abused Excellency of the White House. Probably Trist is a little
                demented—at least at times. What do you think about it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Every body is anxious to hear what they have done in
                Ireland. Heaven grant it may be good news for Freedom!</p>
