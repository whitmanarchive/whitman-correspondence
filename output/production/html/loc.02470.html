            <p class="tei_p">This morning I recd a letter from J.W.W. inviting me to spend
                the afternoon with him &amp; enclosing a facsimile of your kind p.c. of the 14<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst to him. Your reference

                across the deep blue empyrean. At times the entire sky became overcast &amp; we had

                Evening" when Fred Wild read a short paper &amp; selections
                from Ingersoll's Oration upon you.
                The reading provoked a good deal of criticism—some of it very shallow—to
                which Fred replied in a vigorous table speech. I also took part in the discussion,

                the flags of different nations—English, French, German, Swiss &amp;c. Fred
