                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Herbert Gilchrist</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The book</span> came two days ago, &amp; I have been looking over
                all of it, &amp; reading a great part minutely—Surely it has been done well,
                &amp; is a beautiful &amp; (in one sense) sufficient memorial of the noblest mother
                &amp; woman. It appeals to my printer-sense too—is a handsome &amp; generous
                piece of typography &amp; mechanical book making, with its excellent paper &amp;
                press work—Thank you indeed dear H. for sending me an early copy—George and Susan Stafford are
                still at Glendale—Debby and Jo have gone to
                Kansas—I was there last Sunday afternoon—they are well as
                usual—Harry has had a surgical operation on his throat. He now comes up from
                Marlton, (or Glendale) every day, to have the doctor watch &amp; dress it—is a
                little reduced in flesh &amp; blood, but is getting along well—Ed and Van and George are
                    well—Mont is married—(I went down Sunday to G to take him Harry home, at his request)—I am
                still here in my shanty in Mickle street—probably <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">let
                    down a peg or two</span> from when I saw you last, but not much
                different—mentally the same—physically a sad wreck—I am reciting my
                "Death of Abraham Lincoln" lecture when I get a call—(as this is the
                season)—go on to New York for that purpose April 14, if I can get
                there—had a good visit from Chas Rowley of
                Manchester yesterday—I am well as usual—Love to you—Spring is
                tardy here—My canary is singing blithely as I write—</p>
