                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
                    "Mattie" Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00617_n11 note" id="duk.00617_n11"><span>See Helen Price's March 27,

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. He married Louisa Orr Haslam in
                    spring 1871, and they moved to 722 Stevens Street in Camden. At the time of this
                    letter, George was already or would soon be inspecting pipe for Moses Lane at

                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
                    Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
                    Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
