      <p class="tei_p">I have had one or two quite good spells—but am not feeling well just now—have
        got over to the office, &amp; am now sitting at my desk—it is a rainy day here, not
        very cool—Mother, I have nothing particular to write to-day either—but thought I
        would send just a few lines, as you might like to get something—The season is quite
        advanced here—pleasant the past few days, I have been out in the cars every day. I
        have not written very lately either to Jeff<a href="#n0710" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0710">2</a> or Hannah<a href="#n0285" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0285">3</a>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, Mammy dear, how are you getting along at Camden<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a>—&amp; how are Lou<a href="#n0368" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0368">5</a> and George<a href="#n0700" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0700">6</a>—I often wish you were here,
        mother dear, as it would be such a relief to me to have you where I could see you, &amp;
        talk a while—I think there is no doubt that, take the time right through, I gain
        steadily, though very slowly indeed—but I get many tedious spells, both of head &amp;
        limbs—there seems to be great deal of paralysis—I hear, or read of cases, every
        day—One man here to-day told me of his father, who had a very bad stroke at 70 years
        of age, but got over it after all, and lived 17 or 18 years after, by great care—So I
        hear of many cases, some good, some unfavorable—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As to myself, I do not lose faith for a moment, in my ultimate recovery—though, as I
        said, I have some bad hours—sometimes very bad—Well, mama dear, I have scribbled
        out this sheet nearly, such as it is—I sent you a letter last Monday<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">7</a>—I have changed the address on the envelopes to you, mother,
        as you see<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">8</a>—is it right?—I am feeling better—my
        head is some easier—Love to you, dear mama, &amp; all—</p>

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"

                    infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of

                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
