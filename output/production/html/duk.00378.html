               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Brother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter come to-day. Every thing with us is pretty much the same. Mother is pretty much the same. Some days she [is] better, and some not so well. She has taken a good many sulphur vapor baths. She takes one every other day. She goes down in the cars to the baths, in Willoughby street near the City Hall. Sometimes Mat goes with her, [and once in] a while she goes [alo]ne. They are rather agreeable to take—they make one sweat extremely. Mother goes about the same, around the house. She has better use of her arms and wrists than she did there one time—but an hour or two, now and then, generally in the morning, she has bad pains. Her appetite is pretty good. The weather here lately has been awful—three days the heat was as bad as I ever knew it—so I think that had something to do with mother's feeling weak. To-day it is much cooler.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff and Martha and Cis and Eddy are all well. Jess is the same as usual—he works every day in the yard. He does not seem to mind the heat. He is employed in the store-house, where they are continually busy preparing stores, provisions, to send off in the different vessels. He assists in that.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all very glad the 13th is coming home—mother especially. There have been so many accounts of shameful negligence, or worse, in the commissariat of your reg't. that there must be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">something</span> in it—notwithstanding you speak very lightly of the complaints in your letters. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span>, of course, makes the worst of it, every day, to stop men from enlisting.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">All of us here think the rebellion as good as broke—no matter if the war does continue for months yet.</p>
