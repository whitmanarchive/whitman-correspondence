            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter come to-day. Every thing with us is pretty much the same. Mother is pretty much the same. Some days she [is] better, and some not so well. She has taken a good many sulphur vapor baths. She takes one every other day. She goes down in the cars to the baths, in Willoughby street near the City Hall.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Sometimes Mat goes with her, [and once in] a while she goes [alo]ne. They are rather agreeable to take—they make one sweat extremely. Mother goes about the same, around the house. She has better use of her arms and wrists than she did there one time—but an hour or two, now and then, generally in the morning, she has bad pains. Her appetite is pretty good. The weather here lately has been awful—three days the heat was as bad as I ever knew it—so I think that had something to do with mother's feeling weak. To-day it is much cooler.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff and Martha and Cis<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> and Eddy are all well. Jess is the same as usual—he works every day in the yard. He does not seem to mind the heat. He is employed in the store-house, where they are continually busy preparing stores, provisions, to send off in the different vessels. He assists in that.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all very glad the 13th is coming home—mother especially. There have been so many accounts of shameful negligence, or worse, in the commissariat of your reg't. that there must be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">something</span> in it—notwithstanding you speak very lightly of the complaints in your letters. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span>, of course, makes the worst of it, every day, to stop men from enlisting.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">All of us here think the rebellion as good as broke—no matter if the war does continue for months yet.</p>

                    indicates, Walt Whitman wrote frequently. For the list of these letters, see

                        1861</a>, to which Walt Whitman referred, George, writing to his mother
                    from Camp Brooklyn, near Washington, had said: "Well Mother the three Months is
                    going fast and I shall soon be with you again. I see some very foolish articles
                    in the papers about us sutch as not haveing any thing to eat for 36 hours and
                    being almost naked but you must not believe any thing of the kind as we are as
