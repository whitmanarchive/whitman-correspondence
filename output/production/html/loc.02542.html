                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February

                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
