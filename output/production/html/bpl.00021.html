                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for

                    was committed to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with
                    Whitman's more experimental form. Still, as editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at
                    Ralph Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham
                    Lincoln titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
                    contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
