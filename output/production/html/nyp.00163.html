                    as a private in Company F, 4th Vermont Infantry, at Brattleboro on September 21,
                    1861 and reenlisted on December 12, 1863. At the Battle of the Wilderness in May
                    1864, the 4th Vermont sustained extraordinary losses; nearly half of the
                    regiment of 550 men were killed or wounded. Harris was among those wounded and
                    was sent to Armory Square Hospital. In his notebook, Whitman recorded Harris's
                    arrival: "Charley H Harris co F. 4th Vermont bed 35—ward A May 13 '64"
                    (Edward F. Grier, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose

                    Harris was finally discharged for his wounds on December 31, 1864. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00163_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00163_n2"><span>Garaphelia ("Garry") Howard
