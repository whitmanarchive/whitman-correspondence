            <p class="tei_p">I posted you six copies of the last circular this afternoon; I think that John Fraser
                has printed them beautifully, and I told him so. </p>

                friend of Dowden) which I enclose herewith;— "You will kindly
                consider it annual &amp; I hope not only to increase the sum but have great
