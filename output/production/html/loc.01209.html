                "Leaves of Grass." Being a confirmed and rather melancholy invalid myself—something

                    Cummings (1838–1914), originally from Bowdoinham, Maine, was the daughter
                    of Rachel Pennell and Isaac Purington. She married the Civil War veteran Amasa
                    F. Cummings (1822–1898; also known as "Amos"), who was also a native of
                    Maine, and the couple had two children, Leroy and Francis ("Frank"). The family
                    moved to San Diego, California, around 1890 and lived on Kearney Avenue until
                    1910, according to city directories. The directories also indicate that Amasa
                    Cummings was a joiner, while Leroy and Frank worked as printers. Mary and Amasa

                    Whitman's correspondence. This date is supported by Bucke's reference to
                    Cummings's letter in his letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.07356">August 17,
                        1890</a>. Bucke's letter indicates that Whitman had enclosed Cumming's
