            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks, dear Walt, for the two bundles of papers received yesterday and
                to-day—the one containing "Liberty" "N.Y. World" and cuttings and the other
                the "Critic" of 21 Dec. 89. All welcome but especially the "World" with its curious
                "obituary" of Walt Whitman "the American Dante, Aeschylus or Shakespeare" printed in
                '71<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a> and which I had never seen before or even heard of. It is a most valuable item
                for my collection and will be valued beyond most old newspapers. How is the abdominal pain? wearing away I hope? or have
                you seen any doctor about it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well here—beautiful weather most of the time—has been a
                charming day and is now a lovely moonlight night</p>

    <div class="editorial_notes"><hr/><p><em>Correspondent:</em><br/><span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0119 note" id="n0119"><span>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span> published a two-column obituary for Whitman.
                    The paper had recently received a telegram indicating that a "Walter Whitman"
                    had been killed in a railroad accident in Croton, New York. The writers of the
                    obituary confused the victim of the railroad accident, "Walter Whitman," with
                    Walt Whitman the poet, who, at the time the obituary was printed, was alive and
                    well in Washington, D.C. For more on the obituary and the circumstances leading
                    to it, see Todd Richardson, "<a href="https://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol15/iss1/2/">Walt Whitman's 'Lively
