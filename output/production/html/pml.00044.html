                    she wrote to one of her English friends on December 23, "a somewhat severe
                    operation (under ether) to cure an injury received at the birth of one of my
                    children which has always troubled me—The success depended largely on skilful nursing afterward and this Bee accomplished" (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.). In the same letter Mrs. Gilchrist made an interesting comment
                    upon her stay in America: "I rejoice that we came—to see it all with our
                    own eyes, but I also rejoice very much that I do not feel as if I ought to
                    stay—as I should have done if it had offered manifestly better advantages
                    and opportunities for Herby and Bee than England." Not a word about her
                    disillusionment with the person who, not mentioned by name, was simply "an
                    American poet." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
