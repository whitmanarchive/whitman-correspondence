				Mr. Donnelly Aids a Worthy Cause.
			</h3>
				<p class="tei_p">
				
					Hon. Ignatius Donnelly 
				will lecture on "The Authorship of Shakespeare's Plays" 
				at the Academy of Music, on Monday night next, in aid of St. Agnes' Hospital. 
				As this will be the first appearance here for years 
				of a Philadelphia scholar and orator who, in addition to his literary fame, 
				is recognized as one of the 
				most gifted speakers in the West, and as the object is most worthy, 
				it is safe to predict a crowded 
				house and a substantial addition to the resources 
				of one of our grandest local charities.
