        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I will write you a few lines as I sit here, on a clump of sand by the sea shore—having some paper in my haversack, 
        &amp; an hour or two yet, before I start back. Pete, I wish you were with me the few hours past—I have just had a splendid swim &amp; souse in the surf—the waves are slowly rolling in, with a hoarse roar 
        that is music to my ears—the breeze blows pretty brisk from south-west, &amp; the sun is partially clouded—from where I sit I look out on the bay &amp; down the Narrows—vessels sailing in every direction in the distance—a great big black long ocean steamship streaking it up toward New York—&amp; the lines of hills &amp; mountains, far, 
        far away, on the Jersey Coast, a little veiled with blue vapor—here around me, as I sit, it is nothing but barren sand—but I don't know how long I could sit here, to that soothing, rumbling murmuring of the waves—&amp; then the salt breeze—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Pete, if you are still working, and all is going on smooth, you can send me that $50—you might get Mr. Milburn to send it to me by post-office order—give it to him, with this envelope, 
        &amp; ask him to go to p. o. &amp; send a p. o. order to me—it will save you the trouble—But Pete, dear boy, 
        if any thing has turned up in mean time, you needn't send it, as I can get along otherwise<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am doing very well, both in health &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">business prospects</span> here—my book is doing first rate—so every thing is lovely &amp; the goose hangs high—Your loving comrade &amp; father
      </p>

        </p>
        
        <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I wrote the preceding nearly a week ago, intending to finish &amp; send it then—Nothing very new or special with me—Mother has been quite unwell, gets better, &amp; then worse again—I have applied for a few days further leave—The weather here remains nearly perfect—we have had but three or four uncomfortably hot days the past five weeks—every day a fine breeze smelling of the sea—</p>
