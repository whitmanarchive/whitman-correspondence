            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter of the 9th<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—&amp; am real glad to hear from you, &amp; that you are well &amp; in good spirits, as appears by your letter. You speak how much you would like to see me, &amp; we could be together a while. I too, dear friend, would be so glad if we were near each other where we could have each other's company often.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am still working here in the same office—We have lately a new Attorney General<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—One of the first things he did was to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">promote me</span>!—Sensible man, wasn't he?—May the Lord reward him. I have been absent on leave the past summer two months—went to New York—spent most of the time with my mother, in Brooklyn—I have been well since I last wrote to you, mostly—only the last six weeks have had rather a bad time with neuralgia—but am getting over it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Things with friend Hiram Frazee<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> have gone poorly. He went from Harewood hospital here, to Brooklyn, to the City Hospital there—he had a terrific operation there that nearly cost him his life, &amp; after all did no good—it was a pay hospital, &amp; his stay in it cost him $300—The last I heard of Frazee was about two months ago—he was then home—his address is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hiram W. Frazee, Camden, Oneida Co. New York</span>—he wrote me, &amp; said he was as comfortable as one in his condition could be—he spoke about you in his letter, &amp; wanted much to know about you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Wood I have not heard from.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Here in Washington Congress is in session, &amp; rather lively times—I suppose you see the acc'ts in the papers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Comrade, you don't give me the particulars what you are doing, &amp;c. you must, when you write again—you speak of not being overburdened with green backs, &amp; profits &amp;c.—Well, boy, one can bear that, if one only keeps hearty &amp; fat &amp; in good spirits, as I guess you are.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I keep about as stout as ever, and my face red &amp; great beard just the same as when I used to see you—I eat my rations every time, too—I am writing this in the office by a big window with a splendid view of the Potomac &amp; Arlington Heights—Well I find I must close—I send my love to you, darling boy, &amp; I want you always to keep me posted wherever you go, dear Comrade.</p>

                    (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General on July 23, 1866, and served
                    until March 12, 1868, when he resigned to serve as President Johnson's chief
                    counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the conclusion of the trial,
                    Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to confirm him. Failing

                    Speaking to Horace Traubel in 1888, Whitman affirmed his fondness for Stanbery
