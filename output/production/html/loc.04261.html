                    was the father of Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in
                    Camden. Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White
                    Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several
                    occasions. For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G.

                    1.
                    Apparently he changed his mind suddenly, for Whitman wrote in his Commonplace
                    Book on March 8: "Harry S. left London, Canada—now in Detroit," but later
                    interpolated after "Canada"—"for home in N.J." (Charles E. Feinberg
