            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 21st <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  this forenoon, with slip from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nation</span> (herewith
                enclosed, returned)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I am glad you sent it me</span>, as I do
                not see the N.—The eye-works have resumed operations pretty nearly same as
                before—I see out of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">both</span> now &amp; a great blessing in
                my imprisoned condition—A friend has sent me Stedman's book, &amp; I have
                looked it over—it seems to me a dissertation &amp;
                biographies on very grand themes &amp; persons by an amiable "clerk with a pen
                behind his ear"—as Warren Hastings or Macaulay, or Canning or Sheridan or
                somebody said—("By God, sir, if I am to have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a master</span>,
                don't let it be a mere clerk with a pen behind his ear")—I heard from John
                Burroughs ten days since—he was well &amp; every thing right—I hear from
                Dr Bucke pretty often—he is not well himself—(though not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">down</span>)—&amp; there has been bad sickness in his family
                &amp; the hospital staff—his last letter <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  yesterday is dated at Sarnia,
                    Canada—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am getting along comfortably—the weather has been bad as can be &amp; the
                traveling ditto, for three weeks past, my old nag has nearly given out too, &amp; I
                have not been out of the house—which tells on me—great torpor of the
                secretions—I am very clumsy &amp; can hardly get up or down stairs—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The English "offering" (through Rossetti and Herbert Gilchrist) will <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="amount​ ">am't</span>​  to over
                $500—the principal part of which has been already sent me—&amp; on which I am really living this
                winter—write oftener—My last half-annual return of royalties for both my
                books just <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —$20.71cts—the death of Mrs.
                Gilchrist has been a gloom to me, &amp; has affected me ever since—I am not
                sure but she had the finest &amp; perfectest nature I ever met—Glad to hear
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  the Channing's—Give them my love—I am
                scribbling in my little front room down stairs—the parrot has been squalling
                &amp; the canary singing—I write hardly at all—</p>
