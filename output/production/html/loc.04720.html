                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).

                    clerk and one of Whitman's Bolton admirers, frequently hosted annual
                    celebrations of the poet's birthday. In his March 9, 1892, letter to Traubel,
                    Greenhalgh wrote that "Walt has taught me 'the glory of my daily life and
                    trade.' In all the departments of my life Walt entered with his loving
                    personality &amp; I am never alone" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/9/med.00009.172.html">Sunday, March 20, 1892</a>). James Wallace described Greenhalgh as
                    "undoubtedly a rich, royal, plain fellow, not given to ornate word or act" (<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.229.html">Sunday, September 27, 1891</a>). For more on Greenhalgh, see Paul

                    (1863–1929) was an English landscape artist. On <a href="loc.04720">June 19, 1891</a>, Wallace sent to Whitman four watercolor sketches of
                    Rivington by Cooper. In a postscript he wrote "If Traubel fancies any of them I
                    shall be glad to arrange with Cooper for a painting . . . I wanted to send T.
                    something &amp; can think of nothing better." This picture of the lakes at
                    Rivington, near Bolton, was commissioned by the members of the Bolton Whitman
                    Fellowship for presentation to Horace and Anne Traubel in 1892. Cooper, then
                    resident in Bolton, was a friend of the English physician Dr. John Johnston and
                    Wallace, and he later gained fame for his Lakeland paintings and book
                    illustrations. In 1948 Anne Traubel presented it to the Bolton Public Libraries
                    as being of special interest to the Bolton Whitman Fellowship. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
