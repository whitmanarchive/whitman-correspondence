            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very pleased and proud yesterday morning to receive the stitched copy of "Good
                Bye" you sent me, &amp; the enclosed profile photo.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Of course I have seen Johnston's copy of "Good Bye," but I only
                had it for one evening's hasty reading. So that I am very glad to have a copy that I
                can read at leisure &amp; absorb fully.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01234_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01234_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01234_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> And I am very proud to receive it

            <p class="tei_p">The profile photo. pleases me immensely. It's strong contrasts of black &amp; white
                (no half tones) &amp; the peculiar disposition of the lights are very striking,
                &amp; give it a strange effect—as of a half materialized <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">spirit</span> (one of Ossian's ghosts—or some antique prophet) grand &amp;
                pensive, brooding over unfathomable mysteries, sad &amp; tender.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01235_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01235_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01235_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> The majestic dome
                of the head is better shewn than in any other portrait I have, &amp; the noble
                strength &amp; tenderness of the expression are very fine. I shall treasure it while
                I live as a precious addition to my other portraits of you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Johnston sent me copies of your P.C. of June 6<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> &amp; your
                letter of June 9<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> (recd
                today) I am glad to learn from the latter that you were "more free from excessive

                to read Traubel's good &amp; interesting letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I haven't seen Johnston for over a week!—the first time such a thing has
                happened since he returned from America. (I usually see him several times in a
                week.) But I have been very busy, &amp; out of town a good deal, &amp; when he has
                called on me I have been out.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will send the sketches from Rivington by book post this mail. (Lent them to Greenhalgh
                tonight to show to one or two of the friends) I have numbered them in pencil on the
