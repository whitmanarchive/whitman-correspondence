            <p class="tei_p">Horace has gone and I shall (do) miss him 
                much—he is a thoroughly good fellow. We took him in to the 
                11.30 train this A.M. and he ought to reach Phil<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a</span> at 7 A.M. tomorrow. 
                His visit was far too short but we had a good time
                while it lasted—Make him tell you about our drive to Delaware
                yesterday—Horace, D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. Sippi, P.E. Bucke and Self—we had a grand time. On our way to the
                station this morning I got from you a card (27<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> I guess)—tell 
                Horace I have not seen the Whitman piece mentoned in it and ask him to
                send it me—unless you send it yourself. Horace will tell you how we all are
                and what we are doing here. I have your card of 26<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>
                and Phil<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a</span> Press of same date (thanks for it) the little piece in
                it—"Whitman—Ingersoll—Death" might have been worse—but it
                also might have been a good deal better without being anything wonderful. Send and
                get "Brief for Plaintiff" Bacon vs. Shakespeare. 25<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">e</span> Rand &amp; McNally
