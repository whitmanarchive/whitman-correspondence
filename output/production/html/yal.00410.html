        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I send you Jeff's letter, rec'd this morning, as it may
        possibly be later than any you have—I had a very good day yesterday, &amp; the best
        night last night I have had for a week—Doctor Drinkard has just been in—he says
        I am progressing the very best—In a day or two more I think I shall get out—or
        to the front door, at any rate—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear sister Lou,</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter this morning—I will see how I feel, when I get better—about
        coming on—Don't think of such a thing as George's coming on here for me—You may
        be sure I shall be with you all, in as good health as every, yet—&amp; before very
        long—to-day I have been sadly pestered with visitors—every thing goes well with
        me, except the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">slowness</span> of my improvement—</p>
