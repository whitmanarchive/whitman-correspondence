               <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours received—We are all very joyful over what you wrote in regard to George—It seemed to put new life in mother—I went to see the Dr to-day—He said immediately that he would go and see Swinton and talk with him about the matter and urge him to write to Gen Grant  The Dr. thinks that Swinton will do it and that Grant will grant the request—He seemed to feel very sanguine about it—Oh I so hope that we will prove successful in getting George exchanged</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to see that Mason made a response to your asking him to send supplies to George—I intend to send a box this week if I can</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed letter came to the house for you  Mother opened it—I thought I would send it to you and you could tell me if any more of the same style came whether to send them to you or not—</p>
 
            <p class="tei_p">We are now having quite a snow storm—it looks as if it would be quite deep—I am rather sorry to see it for it looks hard for the soilders  I feel disappointed in regard to the peace talks. I was in hopes that we had had war enough  It seems almost impossible that the south can keep up the fight much longer—however I think the president showed a great deal of cuteness in going down to see them and if he only told them that the Union was all he asked [he showed] more statesmanship than I ever gave him credit for  I see that a great many here have not yet given up the idea but what there is something more to come—the desire for a peace on the basis of the Union alone seems so far as I can see meets with universal applause</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well Walt so you have gone to keeping house have you  You must be car[e]ful or you will get sick again—I fear you do not live well—I think the great cause of good health is good eating—Keep up the supply of good things—Do you have about the same experience in the Hospitals as you used to—were the men glad to see you back—were any remaining that you used to visit  if so I know they were glad to see you—and it must seem like old times for you to go among them—Do you see many of the friends that you used to know then—I suppose you visit the Hospitals once a day—are there as many in them as there used to be—I hope not—tis so long since we have had any very large battles that I should suppose the Hospita[l]s were not full
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">What is it about the Exchange of prisoners—do you know it looks to me as if they were trying to delay the exchange and yet talk about it as if they were going to do it and wished to do it all the time—I was very glad to have you write that Hichcock said Butler lied—I thought as much but did not dare to believe it either  I do hope that Grant will make an exchange—The people seem almost to demand it—Do talk it up—Walt—write it up if you have a chance—One thing I think I see and that is that whoever does delay it that they are pretty well frightened about it and want to humbug the people with the idea that they are going to exchange at once—I was almost overjoyed a few nights since to see a dispatch that the President had ordered a complete and general exchange—but alas it turned out to be nothing</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is quite well—Mat and the babies are well and all send their love—the baby often calls "Walt" to come  Write me</p>
