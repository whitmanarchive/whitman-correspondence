               <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours received<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—We are all very joyful over what you wrote in regard to George—It seemed to put new life in mother—I went to see the Dr<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> to-day—He said immediately that he would go and see Swinton<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> and talk with him about the matter and urge him to write to Gen Grant  The Dr. thinks that Swinton will do it and that Grant will grant the request—He seemed to feel very sanguine about it—Oh I so hope that we will prove successful in getting George exchanged</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to see that Mason<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> made a response to your asking him to send supplies to George—I intend to send a box this week if I can</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed letter<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> came to the house for you  Mother opened it—I thought I would send it to you and you could tell me if any more of the same style came whether to send them to you or not—</p>
 
            <p class="tei_p">We are now having quite a snow storm—it looks as if it would be quite deep—I am rather sorry to see it for it looks hard for the soilders  I feel disappointed in regard to the peace talks.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> I was in hopes that we had had war enough  It seems almost impossible that the south can keep up the fight much longer—however I think the president showed a great deal of cuteness in going down to see them and if he only told them that the Union was all he asked [he showed] more statesmanship than I ever gave him credit for  I see that a great many here have not yet given up the idea but what there is something more to come—the desire for a peace on the basis of the Union alone seems so far as I can see meets with universal applause</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well Walt so you have gone to keeping house<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> have you  You must be car[e]ful or you will get sick again—I fear you do not live well—I think the great cause of good health is good eating—Keep up the supply of good things—Do you have about the same experience in the Hospitals as you used to—were the men glad to see you back—were any remaining that you used to visit  if so I know they were glad to see you—and it must seem like old times for you to go among them—Do you see many of the friends that you used to know then—I suppose you visit the Hospitals once a day—are there as many in them as there used to be—I hope not—tis so long since we have had any very large battles that I should suppose the Hospita[l]s were not full<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">What is it about the Exchange of prisoners—do you know it looks to me as if they were trying to delay the exchange and yet talk about it as if they were going to do it and wished to do it all the time—I was very glad to have you write that Hichcock said Butler lied<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>—I thought as much but did not dare to believe it either  I do hope that Grant will make an exchange—The people seem almost to demand it—Do talk it up—Walt—write it up if you have a chance—One thing I think I see and that is that whoever does delay it that they are pretty well frightened about it and want to humbug the people with the idea that they are going to exchange at once—I was almost overjoyed a few nights since to see a dispatch that the President had ordered a complete and general exchange—but alas it turned out to be nothing</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is quite well—Mat and the babies are well and all send their love—the baby often calls "Walt" to come  Write me</p>

                    in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles

                    Julius W. Mason, a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry, had sent a box to

                    Lincoln and his Secretary of State Wiliam H. Seward met with Vice-President of
                    the Confederacy Alexander H. Stephens on the Union transport <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">River Queen</span> lying in Hampton Roads. All through 1864 Lincoln had
                    insisted that he would consider any peace plan that included restoration of the
                    Union <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">and</span> the emancipation of all slaves; he now also
                    demanded a complete end to the war, refusing to consider a temporary cessation
                    of hostilities. Lincoln's last requirement frustrated the Southerners' desire
                    for an armistice, which would, they hoped, allow for a cooling of passions
                    before the beginning of negotiations. The meeting ended with no agreement
                    reached. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00436_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00436_n7"><span>In his letter of <a href="loc.00838">January 30, 1865</a>, Whitman briefly described the
                    comfortable room he rented from "a very friendly old secesh landlady whose
                    husband &amp; son are off in the Southern army." </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00436_n8 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00436_n8"><span>The hospitals were
                    fairly full because, as Whitman noted, some soldiers remained with "bad old
                    lingering wounds" while others were moved to Washington as field hospitals were
                    dismantled. See Whitman's letter to Abby H.

                    Allen Hitchcock (1798–1870), military advisor to Lincoln and U.S.
                    commissioner for the exchange of prisoners, had long feuded with Butler (see
                    Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00434">January 31,
                        1865</a>) over the question of exchanging prisoners. He may have pointed
                    out to Whitman that Grant was not solely responsible for the exchange policy
                    because Stanton and Lincoln shaped it also. </span></span> [<a href="#r9">back</a>]</li></ul>
