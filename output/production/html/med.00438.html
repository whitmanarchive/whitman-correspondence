        <span class="tei_salute">Robert Carter,</span>
        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Thinking that possibly I might be itemised or briefly biographised in the Cyclopaedia I thought I would send you, 
        (or to Mr. Dana,) the accompanying sketch—some authentic statistics, (as I find I am beginning to be noted, 
        &amp; they make sad work of it sometimes.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Leaving of course the whole thing in your hands, I should like you to get the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">statistics</span>, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fact-basis</span>, 
        right—(&amp; should you think proper can be further consulted here, or proof sent, &amp;c.)—My book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> 
        as now printed, is in its permanent form—My other Vol. of equal size <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span>, (i.e. of Real and Ideal) 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">will comprise all my other writings, Prose &amp; Verse</span>, &amp; is now being put into type. I am still prostrated with 
        Cerebral &amp; liver affection, but work occasionally.
      </p>
