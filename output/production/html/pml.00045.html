            <p class="tei_p">After a couple of weeks in New York, Mr Burroughs has brought me up here, where I am to stay for a few days—Every thing goes well—I am very comfortably situated, &amp; it is not only a great change from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​ —but a great relief—I mean the excitement of so much company—every thing is quiet &amp; secluded here—all winter too, the snow white &amp; deep in every direction—as I look from my window, river &amp; mountains &amp; trees &amp; rocks—far &amp; vast—</p>
