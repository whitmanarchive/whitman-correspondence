            <p class="tei_p">I don't feel that I should apologize for writing to you. I have wanted to do so for
                years. I have loved you for years with my whole heart and soul. No man ever lived
                whom I have so desired to take by the hand as you. I read Leaves of grass, and got
                new conceptions of the dignity and beauty of my own body and of the bodies of other
                people; and life became more valuable in consequence. After a year or
                two—always carrying you in my thoughts—holding imaginary conversations
                with you and dreaming of you day and night—I came across a lady who knew you, Mrs
                Lizzie Denton Seybold, now Baker. She had your portrait painted

                in oil. I made
                every effort to induce her to let me have the picture but she would not. Since that
                time—I was living in glorious California then—I have read with deepest
                interest every word about you in the papers and magazines, as well as every thing you
                have written. Sometimes I have been furious at what immodest people—idiots, have
                dared say of you and have longed to write my own pure and true convictions of you.
                But I cannot. I am too impetuous; I feel my subject too deeply. And yet I am a
                writer and make my living by my pen. Now that I have come east this far, where I am
                employed as editor on the Saturday Express,  I have the hope that I may sometime see
                your dearly beloved face, touch with my hand your beautiful grey hair, and possibly
                feel your arm about my waist. Because I love you so I have

                written these
                lines. It is nothing to me who sees them; I am proud of my feeling for you. It has
                educated me; it has done more to raise me from a poor working woman to a splendid
                position on one of the best papers ever published, than all the other influences of
                my life.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I know you must have many letters from strangers, and so I will not take any more of
                your time in reading what I have to say. Of course I have no hope of receiving an
                answer to this. But I thought it no harm to let you know that my love went with you,
                and perhaps in some unknown way was a blessing to you all these years.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Good bye dear Walt Whitman—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my beloved</span>, and may every
                influence in life contribute to your happiness.</p>
