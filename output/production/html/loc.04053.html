            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">2</a> has told you of our difficulties in getting comfortable quarters here—and also that we seem now to have succeeded—not indeed in the way I most wished &amp; hoped we had—in 19th St., taking rooms &amp; boarding ourselves—so that we could have a friend with us when &amp; as we pleased. It seems as if that were not practicable unless we were to furnish for ourselves. Certainly our experiences there of using another's kitchen were discouraging—it was so dirty and uncomfortable that we were glad to take refuge in a regular boarding house again before one week was out. It seems to me more difficult to get anything of a medium kind in New York than elsewhere I have been—if it isn't the best, it is very uninviting indeed. Herby is enjoying his work and companionship at the League very much. We stand the cold well—how does it suit you? Is your arm free from rheumatic pains? When you come to Mr. J. H. Johnstons,<a href="#n0336" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0336">3</a> which will be very soon I hope, we shall be quite handy, and have a pretty, sunny room—a sitting room by day!—with a handsome piece of furniture which is metamorphosed into a bed at night—and a large dressing closet with hot &amp; cold water adjoining—all very comfortable. O how wistfully do I think of one evening in Philadelphia, last winter. I shan't begin really to like New York till you come and we have had some chats together. I have news from England which makes me rather anxious. The Blaenavon Co., to which Per.<a href="#n2000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2000">4</a> is chemist, has gone into liquidation—&amp; I don't know whether it will continue to exist—or how soon in these dull times he may find a good opening elsewhere. Should things go badly for him, either Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">5</a> and I will return to England to share [our] home with him there, or else I want him to take into serious consideration coming out here, instead of our going back. Of course it would be a risky thing for him to do with wife<a href="#n3006" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3006">6</a> &amp; child, in these times, unless some definite opening presented itself, but I cannot help thinking that, being an expert in his profession, with first rate training &amp; experience, and iron work &amp; metallurgy promising here to have such enormous developments, he would be sure to do well in the end; and meanwhile we could rub on together somehow. However, we shall see. I have laid the matter before him, he &amp; his dear little wife wrote me a very brave, cheery letter when they told me the bad news—&amp; I shall have an answer to mine, I suppose, by the end of the month. Kate Hillard<a href="#n0302" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0302">7</a> read an amusing paper on Swinburne<a href="#n0610" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0610">8</a> at a meeting of the Woman's Club in Brooklyn—&amp; we had some fine music too. For the rest, I have not yet presented any introductions here.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Have had some beautiful glimpses of the North &amp; East River effects of the shipping at sunset, &amp;c.—Have subscribed to the Mercantile library,—&amp; are beginning to feel at home. Herby &amp; Giddy had been to hear Mr. Frothingham<a href="#n1504" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1504">9</a> this morning, &amp; were much interested. Bee<a href="#n0260" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0260">10</a> missed us sorely at first—but writes—when she does write, which is but seldom—pretty cheerily. Friendly remembrance to your brother &amp; sister. I wonder where Hattie<a href="#n0911" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0911">11</a> &amp; Jessie<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">12</a> are spending their holidays.

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
                    Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
                    writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his <a href="duk.00657">June 23,

                    To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can

                        A Critical Essay</span> (1868), Swinburne pointed out similarities between
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His
                    famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs
