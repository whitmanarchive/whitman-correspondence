                    Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Whitman in
                    Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
                    corresponded with him. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24, 1864,
                    he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was
                    renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On March 5, 1875,
                    Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I
                    would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore.
                    what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on August 16,
                    1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California. Eleven
                    letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection at Duke University. He is also
                    mentioned in Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During War</span>; Richard
                    Maurice Bucke, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span>
                    [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134. The year is confirmed by the
                    reference to Farwell's letter of March 5, 1875 (Trent). (For Farwell's
