                    with Wilson,a former soldier, can be reconstructed from Wilson's letters in the
                    Feinberg Collection. On July 18, 1869, Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory
                    Square Hospital (see Whitman's <a href="loc.00802">8-9 November 1863</a>),
                    "when your kind face &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won
                    their hearts. I never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp;
                    I got there. We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's
                    first letter, written on <a href="loc.00611">November 11, 1865</a>, he
                    began: "I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time
                    but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be
                    forgotten by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on <a href="loc.00614">December 16, 1866</a>: "I wish if aggreable to yourself
                    to keep up a regular correspondence between us . . . I think it will be of
                    benefit to me morally and perhaps will not be of any detriment to you." In this
                    letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Whitman was a poet. On
                    January 27, 1867, he informed Whitman that he had been reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago
                    that I was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
                    displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever your | Boy
                    Friend | with Love | Benton H. Wilson." Whitman replied (lost), and sent William
                    D. O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span>, which Wilson
                    acknowledged on February 3. On April 7, 1867, after he informed Whitman that his
                    wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child was to be
                    named Walt Whitman), he complained: "I am poor and am proud of it but I hope to
                    rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am not happy for my
                    disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I love her dearly but I
                    seem to lack patience or something. I think I had ought to live alone, but I had
                    not ought to feel so." On April 21, Wilson acknowledged Whitman's reply of April
                    12: "I do not want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my
                    Situation &amp; feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be
                    more guarded in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how
                    I was situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is
                    your advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I
                    wish you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
                    freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On September 15, Wilson wondered why
                    Whitman had not replied. See also Whitman's letter to Benton H. Wilson from
                    April 15, 1870 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–69],
