               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">My idea is a book of the time, worthy the time—something considerably beyond mere hospital sketches—a book for sale perhaps in a larger American market—the premises or skeleton memoranda of incidents, persons, places, sights, the past year (mostly jotted down either on the spot or in the spirit of seeing or hearing what is narrated)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>—(I left New York early last December, &amp; have been around in the front<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> or here ever since)—full of interest I surely think—in some respects somewhat a combination in handling of the Old French Memoires, &amp; my own personality (things seen through my eyes, &amp; what my vision brings)—a book full enough of mosaic, but all fused to one comprehensive thing—one of the drifts is to push forward the very big &amp; needed truth, that our national military system needs shifting, revolutionizing &amp; made to tally with democracy, the people<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>—The officers should almost invariably rise from the ranks—there is an absolute want of democratic spirit in the present system &amp; officers—it is the feudal spirit exclusively—nearly the entire capacity, keenness &amp; courage of our army are in the ranks—(what has been done has been unavoidable so far, but the time has arrived to discuss the change)—</p>    
            <p class="tei_p">I have much to say of the hospitals, the immense national hospitals—in them too most radical changes of premises are demanded—(the air, the spirit of a thing is every thing, the details follow &amp; adjust themselves). I have many hospital incidents, [that] will take with the general reader—I ventilate my general democracy with details very largely &amp; with reference to the future—bringing in persons, the President, Seward<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>, Congress, the Capitol, Washington City, many of the actors of the drama—have something to say of the great trunk America, the West &amp;c &amp;c—do not hesitate to diffuse <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">myself</span>—the book is very rapid—is a book that can be read by the five or ten minutes at (being full of small parts, pieces, paragraphs with their dates, incidents &amp;c)—I should think two or three thousand sale ought to be certainly depended on here in hospitals in Washington, among departments &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My idea is a book of handy size &amp; form, 16 mo or smallish 12 mo, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">first rate paper</span> (this last indispensable), ordinary binding, strongly stitched, to cost including copyright not more than 35 or 40cts or <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">there-abouts​ </span></span> to make, to retail for a dollar. It should be got out <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediately</span>. I think an edition, elegantly bound, might be pushed off for books for presents &amp;c for the holidays, if advertised for that purpose. It would be very appropriate. I think it a book that would please women. I should expect it to be popular with the trade.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Of course I propose the affair to you publisherially as something to invest in, to make out of (for both of us)—I take it it would be a very handsome speculation. Only it is to be done while the thing is warm, namely <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">at once</span>. I have been &amp; am in the midst of these things, I feel myself full of them, &amp; I know the people generally now are too (far more than they know,) &amp; would readily absorb &amp; understand my mem[oranda]. Wherefore let us make &amp; publish the book, &amp; out with it so as to have it for sale by middle or 20th of November.<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">5</a>

                    an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
                    author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</span> (Boston:
                    Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                        Tribune</span> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
                    met Whitman in Boston in 1860, and he remained an enthusiastic admirer; see
                    Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.65.html">Friday, January 4, 1889</a>. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on
                        <a href="loc.01012">June 25, 1860</a>: "I love you, Walt! A conquering
                    Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
                    managing editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The North American Review</span> in 1886. See

                    Redpath as the publisher of his proposed book because earlier in the year he had
                    printed Louisa May Alcott's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hospital Sketches</span>, which
                    relates the experiences of Tribulation Periwinkle in a military hospital in
                    Georgetown. (Periwinkle, actually the author, had expected to go to Armory
                    Square Hospital, but at the last minute was sent to "Hurly-burly House.") In his
                    reply on <a href="med.00320">October 28, 1863</a>, Redpath said that there
                    was "a lion in the way—$. I could easily publish a small Book, but the
                    one you propose...implies an expenditure that may be beyond my means." Whitman's
                    proposal was not to be realized until the publication of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During the War</span>. Accompanying Whitman's draft letter is his
                    sketch of the title page. An editor fully sympathizes with Traubel's remark
                    (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>
                    [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953], 4:416) when he received
                    this letter from Whitman: "It made me sweat to look at it." It is a maze of
                    interlineations. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_yal.00093_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="yal.00093_n3"><span>Once again Whitman

                    with Ben in Ward A about tyrannous and unnecessary exposure of the
                    soldiers—how many officers there are who dare not go into engagements nor
                    even out on picket with their men, for fear of their lives from their own
                    men—the 8th N Y Cav Col Davis, (killed afterward) who . . . made the poor
                    sick men (sick with diarrhea) dismount &amp; mount 13 times to make them do it
