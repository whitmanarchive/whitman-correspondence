                as well as this indicates. I do not like the title of the new book as well as the one you proposed 
                last spring—namely "Songs &amp; pieces Leftover" This sounds like you, the other does not. 
                We have had a very dry season here till just now. My berry crop &amp; other crops were 
                much injured.</p>
