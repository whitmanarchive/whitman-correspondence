                without tiring you. They can speak of divine things without mockery. They can speak
                of tenderness, without annoying you. They can talk with you of "India"—of
                "more than India"—and you will understand each other. I do not know what
                flowers you love best. If I were arranging flowers for your room, I should have

                miracles, quite a variety of them, might enable you to fancy you had left your room,
                and were picking them as you walked. I wanted to see them put in the box, but the
                kind hearted man who held them in his care assured me they had better remain
                unpacked till just before the express train left Boston. The dear little crocuses I
                picked from my own tiny spot of earth, and sent each one laden with
                loving wishes. May they carry their messages safely.</p>

                busy, but am anticipating the pleasure soon. How good it will be to speak with her

                    née Pearsons, was a socialite and active member of various reform movements

                    and was a member of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. She married
                    Ebenezer Spaulding, an Assistant Surgeon during the Civil War, and, later, a
                    homeopathic physician and surgeon who practiced in Boston. Ada Spaulding read
                    and admired Whitman's poetry, visited the poet, and wrote a number of letters to
                    him in his final years. For more on Spaulding, see Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="https://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol9/iss3/4/">Women's Letters to Walt
