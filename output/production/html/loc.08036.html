            <p class="tei_p">Hold out yet tho' bad days these—have had ten days of depression, worst kind,
                &amp; am now in the midst of same—Your &amp; J W W[allace]'s letters come &amp; are welcomed indeed, with the Mag's in wh' I
                find many interesting bits—Dr Bucke is sick or half sick
                in Canada—I enclose two or three pp: of the extra proofs—Dr Longaker comes faithfully, was here yesterday—fortunately I
                retain pretty fair nights—Warry gives me a good
                robust massage when I go to bed &amp; that helps muchly—pass part of the day
                lying on bed—am not writing any thing—Affectionate wishes to you
                all—</p>
