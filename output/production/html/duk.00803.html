            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours just received (with the 10—many thanks—)—the kind invitation
                    reiterated—&amp;c—I am in pretty fair
                condition generally, but unable to walk or get around, except very small stretches,
                &amp; with effort—somehow feel averse to leaving this shanty of
                mine—where I am probably getting along better than you think—</p><p class="tei_p">Mrs
                Gilchrist's essay has appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">To-Day</span>—probably
                she will send it to you—if not, I will send you mine—It is a noble
                paper—I have a little poem to appear in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Outing</span>,
                perhaps in the forthcoming number—Mary Smith &amp;
                all the family (our Germantown friends) start for Europe to-morrow to be gone over a
                year.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I write it is a delightful day—temperature perfect—I take the car to
                the ferry, &amp; get out on the river every pleasant day.</p>
