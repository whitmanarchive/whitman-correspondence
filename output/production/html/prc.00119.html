                    (1823–1912) was born in Yorkshire, England, and emigrated to the United
                    States in 1837. He became a lay minister in the Methodist church but later
                    converted to Unitarianism and preached at various churches in Chicago. Collyer
                    took over the ministry of the Unitarian Church of the Messiah in New York in
                    1879. In 1888, Walt Whitman described to Horace Traubel an argument in which
                    Collyer got the better of him, conceding "Collyer's not deep but he's damned
                    cute" and summarized him as "a kind of reduced Beecher—a Beecher with much
                    of the grace lopped off" (Horace Traubel, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
