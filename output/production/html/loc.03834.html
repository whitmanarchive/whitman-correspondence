                    (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
                    with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
                    often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
                    Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

                    on March 8—"earnest &amp; friendly, deeply so" (Whitman's Commonplace
                    Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In May, Dr. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke stayed with Smith, and during his visit there was discussion of a
                    "project for the special ed'n L of G. backed by Mr. S. and Dr. Mr S's sudden
                    &amp; peremptory withdrawal from the project (Mrs. S 'wouldn't allow the book to
                    be brought in the house')" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Evidently Mrs. Smith's
                    censure did not extend to the poet himself, since she and her daughters on his
                    birthday sent sheets and a bolster (see the letter from Whitman to Mary Whitall
                    Smith of <a href="loc.01344">May 28, 1884</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03834_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03834_n2"><span>On March 8, Whitman spent
                    "all the day &amp; evening" with Tasker Lay, who, when the poet met him in 1881,
                    was "15 or 16." The young man died on the following day and was buried on March
                    12 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). About this time Whitman gave the boy's
                    grandfather, Alfred, a laborer, various sums of money, including $16 for the
                    rent due on the house at 328 Mickle Street (see Whitman's Commonplace Book and
                    his letter to John Burroughs of <a href="loc.01150">March 27, 1884</a>).
                    The Lays rented the house at the time (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Solitary Singer</span> [1955], 516). According to entries in his Commonplace
                    Book, Whitman paid Mrs. Lay $2 weekly from April 5 to September 27. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
