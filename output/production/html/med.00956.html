            <p class="tei_p">"Through between New York and New Orleans by daylight,"
                is the feat which, I notice, by one of your contemporaries of the 19th inst., was
                accomplished the preceding day. All hail! thou telegraph—thou who puttest a
                girdle round at least a good portion of the earth, in literally, less than no time!
                Nor doth this girdle come in a bad period, either; for these are the days when
                foolish men, of various extremes of opinion, talk about "dissolving the Union," as
                they would of selling a house! Truly, a ligature of lightning will be one of the
                sovereignst things on earth to hold what they would so madly unloose. As it is, I do
                not think, in sober seriousness, there is any reality of danger to the integrity of
                our Republic; but lace the States thoroughly together with magnetic wires, and no
                human power could ever break asunder the bundle. This I solemnly believe.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">But about
                this dissolution talk; does not most of it seem to you excessively foolish? As a
                last resort—as an escape from insult, wrong, and oppression—as a means
                of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">something better</span> than the fruits which the union of these States has thus far
                produced—dissolution might be talked about with less puerility. But, as things
                are, it seems to me that all sensible men, South and North, must feel disgust at the
                way the point is bandied in Congress and among politicians.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">To-day is one of the
                dampest, darkest, and drizzliest of summer days. Everything in-doors and out, is
                pervaded by the sticky moisture. The east wind, withal, is laden with sea-fog, which
                seems to settle heavily over the citizens, and check the usual briskness and
                activity of a Monday morning. For you must know that Monday, in New York, is the day
                of days. The majority of important business transactions are effected on that day:
                the dandy and the belle put on their new attire on that day; and then the theatres
                bring out their fresh pieces; and then folks commence engagements; then, also,
                people get married. To-day, however, the briskest business appears to be done by the
                street-crossing sweepers, who are scudding across, from either side of Broadway,
                with their petticoats tucked between their legs; their "please give me a penny for
                keeping the walk clean," rarely indeed producing any effect amid the general
                sulkiness.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Considerable vexation is felt here at the culpable remissness of the
                Senate in not passing the bill for establishing a mint in New York. The idea of
                tacking on a section, for the purpose of building a mint also at Charleston, S.C.,
                is absurd. Let each tab stand on its own bottom. Congress has a very bad practice of
                mixing up two or three separate matters in one bill, and forcing the good portions to
                either carry through the bad, or let the whole be sunk. As these are days of
                improvement, it would be well if a standing rule were adopted in both Houses,
                requiring each separate subject of a law to be embodied and passed upon by itself.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Hunker<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> wing of the democracy are to 
                hold a State convention on the 5th of next
                September,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">2</a> to nominate a candidate for Governor. The Barnburners hold their
                convention about a week later.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">3</a> A week from next Wednesday, the great Buffalo
                convention<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">4</a> comes off, when we shall see exciting times, and no mistake. It is most
                probable that Van Buren<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">5</a> will be confirmed as the "free-soil" nominee for the
                Presidency. Many talk of Judge McLean<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> as likely to be put upon the same ticket for
                the Vice-Presidency. Even Clay<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">7</a> is talked of for the same station. It is by no means
                improbable that he may be nominated. There is reason to doubt, however, whether he
                would accept. Mr. Clay makes no secret of his opposition to Gen. Taylor;<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">8</a> and the
                general opinion is, that he will come out in favor of the Buffalo nominee.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A rumor
                is circulated in some of the morning papers, that Gen. Cass<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">9</a> has written a letter,
                affirming his determination, should he be elected, to veto the Wilmot proviso.<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">10</a></p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The steamer Hermann will be looked for to-morrow morning. People will not be surprised
                to see her streaking up the bay before the sun goes down. She must have left
                Southampton on the 20th inst., with some 120 passengers; that number being booked
                for the voyage. The America, from Liverpool, is probably close upon her heels,
                having left on the 22d, also for this port. The Crescent City leaves to-morrow for
                New Orleans, and will very likely be at the levee by the time you get this epistle.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Talking of steamers, I do wish you could see, as she now lies upon the stocks, the
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">largest steamboat in the world</span>, at the foot of Twelfth street. This immense craft is
                400 feet in length, breadth and other matters in proportion. She is for a day-boat
                on the Hudson, and is intended to go to Albany and back, by daylight! She is a sort
                of moving Astor House, an aquatic St. Charles Hotel! She is fitted up with
                innumerable parlors, dining-rooms, etc.; the plan being to furnish passengers with
                meals in the refectory style—not by a general <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">table d'hote</span>. She is a whopper,
                there's no denying that; and will introduce a new era in steam travel on the Hudson.
                Her burthen is 1600 tons, propelled by forty-six-feet wheels, and an engine of 15
                feet stroke. Her accommodations are for over 2000 persons.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Gen. Taylor's letter of
                acceptance appears in the papers to-day. It is written in general terms, and excites
                no feeling, either favorable or condemnatory. It is pretty evident that, in case of
                the old General's election, the Republic would not have a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">party</span> President—and
                that's more than can be said of several late ones.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Every body is pleased at hearing
                that the Senate has passed the resolution for adjourning on the 14th of August;
                without doubt, the House will confirm it.</p>

                    opposing sides of the fracturing Democratic party in New York during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
                    reflected the national divisions that would lead to the American Civil War (1861–1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00956_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00956_n6"><span>The Hunker state convention was held in Syracuse, New York.

                    is referring to the first National Free Soil Convention that
                    was held in Buffalo in August 1848. At the convention, attendees endorsed
                    Martin Van Buren (1782–1862) as the Free Soil presidential candidate
                    and nominated Charles F. Adams (1807–1886) for Vice President. Formed during the 1848 election, the Free Soil 
                    Party opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories of the western United States,
                    which included the territory that Mexico had ceded to the United States
                    in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War. When neither the 
                    Democratic nor the Whig party presidential nominees would rule out the expansion of slavery
                    into these territories, the Free Soil Party was formed in response. The Free Soil
                    Party was active for six years, from 1848 to 1854. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n11 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n11"><span>Martin Van Buren (1782–1862) was the eighth president of the United

                defeated the incumbent Van Buren in the 1840 election to become the ninth
                president of the United States. Van Buren later became an anti-slavery leader and 
                was the Free Soil candidate for president in the 1848 election; the Whig Candidate Zachary Taylor
                (1784–1850) defeated Van Buren and went on to serve as the twelfth president of the United States. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00956_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00956_n2"><span>John McLean (1785–1861) was

                    was not chosen as the Free Soil Vice Presidential nominee in the 1848 election. Instead, Charles 
                    F. Adams (1807–1886) became the running mate of Free Soil Presidential candidate
