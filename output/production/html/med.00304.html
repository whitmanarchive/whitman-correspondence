                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
                    gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry Boy and the
                        Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
                    had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the letter
                    from <a href="nar.00002">January 10, 1863</a>
                    . Though Trowbridge was
                    not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms
                    my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and greatness of
                    this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman,
                    "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>, 23
                    [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman

                        [PMLA]</span>, 63 (1948): 262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge
                    stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
                    D. O'Connor. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00304_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00304_n3"><span>At Whitman's request,
                    Trowbridge visited Babbitt (see Whitman's letter from <a href="loc.00786">September 3, 1863</a>) in Mason Hospital, and wrote on <a href="loc.00876">December 21, 1863</a>, that his discharge was delayed
                    because of Dr. Bliss's failure to send a descriptive list. "What [Babbitt] needs
                    is sympathizing friends around him. He is very lonesome lying here on his back,
                    with no Walt Whitman to cheer him up." Trowbridge's letter of <a href="med.00321">December 30, 1863</a>, informed Walt Whitman that the
                    descriptive list had arrived, and that the package contained two copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Drummer Boy, a Story of the War in Verse</span> (1862) by

                    Shillaber (1814–1890) was a celebrated humorist and newspaperman. While he
                    was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Post</span>, he invented the American
                    version of Mrs. Malaprop, and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life and Sayings of Mrs.
                        Partington</span> (New York: J.C. Derby, 1854) was a best-seller. John
                    Townsend Trowbridge was associated with Shillaber in the short-lived comic
                    journal <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Carpet Bag</span>, in which appeared the first writings
                    of Artemus Ward and Mark Twain. Shillaber wrote to Whitman about Babbitt on
