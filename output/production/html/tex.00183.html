            <p class="tei_p">Well, every thing is just about the same. I rec'd your letter New Years. I have rec'd
                a small present from Heyde—he sent me a small stereoscope,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> that is to put pictures in,
                &amp; look through it, &amp; it magnifies them, &amp; makes them look like the real
                thing—it has some beautiful views of scenes in Vermont—I forget whether
                I told you that I sent Han some gloves &amp; a $5 bill, Christmas—so I
                suppose this is in return—He says Han rec'd the parcels.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Mrs. Grayson<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> is still living—she is slightly better—I
                go [to] the hospital now oftener than usual—there are several very
                low—I just go, for an hour or so, [a] time—I had rather go than
                not—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Every thing is covered with snow here, looks wintry enough—cold weather, but
                somehow I like it—I have no fire in my room, so far, this winter—I have
                rec'd a letter from Mrs. Price. You must tell me how George is getting along with
                his business. You might ask George whether any thing could be done with $500
                cash about getting a lot &amp; moderate-sized two story house to have say 15 or
                $1600 on mortagage?—whether they could get some one to take the rest on
                mortgage, so as to save themselves<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mat, I went to the opera last [night]—went alone—I was much pleased
—the piece was Ernani<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—first
                amusement I have been to in a year, except once to hear Ristori<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>
—Good by, mother dear.</p>

                    about her procrastination, acknowledged the gifts in a letter to her mother on
