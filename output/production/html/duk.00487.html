            <p class="tei_p">You will be please to learn that Han's condition is improving—Dr 
                Binghams father is very old and failing—he has gone to see him, 
                and has supplied Han with all necessary remedies—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have grown nervous—as a consequence of this illness of Han's—I was
                allways of an apprehensive nature——</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think that Lou could come on, without detriment, to Han's convalescence, and yet
                her visit might have a prostrating effect—I will write every day—here it
                is—hopefull now—</p>
