            <p class="tei_p">I send you the latest from our dear friend O'Connor not knowing 
                whether you will get word directly—I am having one 
                of my bad spells, but it will probably pass over—I have had my breakfast, (two 
                or three stewed oysters &amp; a piece of toast)—am sitting here in the little 
                front room down stairs—the sun is shining &amp; my bird singing—I havent 
                been out in many days—pretty cold here—I recd 
                a letter from J. B. Marvin, his circular "Bureau of Information 
                at Washington" &amp;c—Washington—I am billed to read the Lincoln lecture 
                in the Unitarian Church here, April 5—See if I can get there—God bless you 
                all—</p>
