                    John Burroughs, and Richard Maurice Bucke were
                    three of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy (1850–1929) first
                    met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880, and would go on to write a book-length study of the
                    poet. Burroughs (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C.
                    in 1864 and became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also
                    go on to write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian
                    physician, was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his
                    medical advisors and literary executors. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n3">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00835_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00835_n3"><span>This letter
