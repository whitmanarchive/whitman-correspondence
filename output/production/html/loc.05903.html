                    (1833–1904) began to practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War,
                    he was in the New Jersey legislature and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned
                    actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S.
                    Treasury during Chester Arthur's administration. In the 1870s, Whitman
                    frequently went to Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast (Whitman's Commonplace
                    Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
                    these breakfasts, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</span>, ed.
                    William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
                    see George R. Prowell's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The History of Camden County, New
                        Jersey</span> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.05903_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.05903_n1"><span>Apparently this letter
                    was written on Tuesday, April 7, 1885, since Scovel on that date informed
                    Whitman that his note had arrived too late in the evening for the "promised sour
                    mash." At this time Scovel was preparing an article about Whitman for the
                    Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span>, and the poet was insisting upon
                    alterations. On <a href="loc.03744">April 7</a> Scovel suggested that "to
                    start <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">right</span> again I think you had better send me my
                    MSS—and let me do as I d—n please with it." On <a href="loc.05904">May 7</a> and again on <a href="loc.03721">May
                        12</a> Scovel asked Whitman to return the manuscript. The article, simply
                    called "Walt Whitman," was sent to the newspaper on May 22 (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book) and appeared on June 15; it detailed Whitman's financial
                    returns from the sale of articles and books with information obviously supplied
                    by the poet. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
