                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief
                    organizer. She attended Bryn Mawr College and was a graduate of the class of
                    1890. She and her family lived in Britain for two years during her childhood and
                    again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
                    chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
                    St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
                    to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
                    educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
                    Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
                    (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." </span></span> [<a href="#r7014">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07757_n5 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="loc.07757_n5"><span>Chalkley LeConey of

                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
