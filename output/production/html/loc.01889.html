                He may have told you—&amp; indeed it cannot have needed telling—that you
                were a very principal subject of our discourse, &amp; of my reiterated
                enquiries.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It interests me to see in your letter that you have a habit of taking moonlight walks
                out of Washington: I used to find walks of this kind highly enjoyable, &amp; have
                frequently indulged in them years ago. In my youth I was living in habits of daily
                &amp; brotherly intimacy with various painters (Millais,<a href="#n0771" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0771">4</a> Holman
                      Hunt,<a href="#n0317" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0317">5</a> &amp;c); &amp; from time to time we <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  all sally out, 6 or 7, say towards 11 at
                  night, &amp; pass the whole
                  night, &amp; sometimes the succeeding day 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.027_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01889.027_large.jpg</span> 
                as well, tramping about, &amp;
                enjoying the varying effects of night, dawn, &amp;c—studied of course with
                peculiar interest, &amp; directness of observation &amp; purpose, by the painters:
                sometimes, instead of walking, we <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  row up the river from nightfall to day. There is a goodish deal of
                agreeable country round London: but, unless one lives quite out in the suburbs, it
                takes miles of walking to get even to the beginning of anything green or rural. I
                can easily imagine that to walk out of Washington at night "into Virginia or
                Maryland"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a> is an experience of a very different sort, in point of grandeur &amp;
                impressiveness. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Though​ ">Tho'</span>​  indeed, from some points of view <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  you of all men realize most intensely, nothing surely can be more
                impressive than the unmeasured size

                &amp; colossal agglomeration of
                life in London—none the less felt <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="through​ ">thro</span>​ 
                the interminable streets when all
                are asleep, &amp; scarcely a passenger met athwart one's path. The interval when the
                streets are really deserted to this extent is but brief: I suppose from about 2¾ to
                4 a.m. is the most vacant time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What you say about the insulting &amp; in fact ungrateful treatment <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  your poems continue to receive in America is deeply interesting, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  painful. I suppose it is a very general if not universal experience that
                anything that is at once great &amp; extremely novel encounters for some
                considerable time much more hostility than acceptance, &amp; so far your experience
                is not surprising—rather indeed a testimonial, when properly considered, to
                the great intrinsic value of your writings. But certainly 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.029_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.029_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.029_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01889.029_large.jpg</span> 
                it does seem that in degree &amp;
                duration the obduracy of Americans <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="against​ ">agst.</span>​  your work is something abnormal &amp; unworthy—especially
                considering the spirit of intense patriotic love &amp; national insight <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  pervades your book <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="through​ ">thro</span>​  &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="through​ ">thro.</span>​  That America <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  be so wanting (in this matter at least) in large receptiveness &amp; quick
                intuition is distressing to those who love her—among whom I may humbly but
                truly profess myself. It seems as if she were even <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">less</span>
                capable than others of appreciating great work vital with the very marrow of her
                bones &amp; corpuscles of her blood: perhaps this very affinity is partly the
                reason—but at any rate a bad &amp; perverse reason. In this country there are
                of course very diverse knots of opinion, &amp; schools of thinking &amp; criticism,
                &amp; to several of these your 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.030_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01889.030_large.jpg</span> 
                works are still an exasperation &amp; an offence: but others
                accept &amp; exalt you with all readiness of love &amp; delight, &amp; I think I may
                safely say that it is these <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh</span>​  have in their holding the future of English opinion on such matters for
                some years to come.—But I will say no more on this tack. For myself (with
                others) who believe in you with the certainty of full conviction, all these
                considerations are poor &amp; slight: the one thing is the work itself, &amp; the
                maker of the work, which has a destiny as assured &amp; as limitless as that of any
                other great product of the soul or of nature.</p>

                What I saw of him I liked
                particularly. He seems an uncommonly young man to be a Professor—less than 30
                to look at; &amp; is in no common degree good–looking, pleasant, open, &amp;
                sound–minded. There are few men, I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  say, more likely to have their sympathies in literary matters sane &amp;
                right—guided also by the fullest measure of lettered cultivation. Mrs.
                    Gilchrist<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">8</a> I dined with not many weeks ago. She seems to
                have fairly recovered from a very exhaustive &amp; indeed dangerous illness that
                oppressed her of late (say from the early autumn of 1870 to the late summer of
                1871)—only that she is not so capable as she used to be of continuous mental
                or bodily strain. It was a pleasure to see her surrounded by her family,

                present a very obtuse exterior to their advances or approaches: for myself, I can

                I dare say you know) is a remarkably fine manly person to look at, with a noble

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising

                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:

                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n0523">16. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0523 note" id="n0523"><span>William Michael Rossetti edited the series <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Moxon's Popular Poets</span> from 1870 to 1875.

                    as "a rowdy," an opponent stylistically of "the small flute of the Academies,"

                    the prophet and the child." When Traubel in 1888 asked how Walt Whitman reacted
                    to the newspaper article, Whitman replied: "I can see some of the
                    features—yes. ... As to being any way associated with Garibaldi—that
                    is the crowning tribute. Garibaldi belongs to the divine eleven!" (270). </span></span> [<a href="#r0255">back</a>]</li><li id="n0432">19. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0432 note" id="n0432"><span>Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1825) was the
