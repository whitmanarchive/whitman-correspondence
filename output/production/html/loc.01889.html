                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your very interesting &amp; valued letter of 30 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="January​ ">Jan.<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">y</span></span>​  ought to have been answered before now. As you
                are willing to confess in it, however, to being an irregular correspondent, I gladly
                avail myself of so tempting an opening for saying that I am the same—&amp;
                shall feel confident that my delay is pardoned.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I read with much zeal the poem you kindly sent me, with
                its deep sonata–like alternations of emotion.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was a peculiar pleasure to me to get acquainted with Mr. Bur<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.026_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>roughs, to whom <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  you please remember me with great cordiality whenever the chance occurs.
                He may have told you—&amp; indeed it cannot have needed telling—that you
                were a very principal subject of our discourse, &amp; of my reiterated
                enquiries.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It interests me to see in your letter that you have a habit of taking moonlight walks
                out of Washington: I used to find walks of this kind highly enjoyable, &amp; have
                frequently indulged in them years ago. In my youth I was living in habits of daily
                &amp; brotherly intimacy with various painters (Millais, Holman
                      Hunt, &amp;c); &amp; from time to time we <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  all sally out, 6 or 7, say towards 11 at
                  night, &amp; pass the whole
                  night, &amp; sometimes the succeeding day 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.027_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                as well, tramping about, &amp;
                enjoying the varying effects of night, dawn, &amp;c—studied of course with
                peculiar interest, &amp; directness of observation &amp; purpose, by the painters:
                sometimes, instead of walking, we <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  row up the river from nightfall to day. There is a goodish deal of
                agreeable country round London: but, unless one lives quite out in the suburbs, it
                takes miles of walking to get even to the beginning of anything green or rural. I
                can easily imagine that to walk out of Washington at night "into Virginia or
                Maryland" is an experience of a very different sort, in point of grandeur &amp;
                impressiveness. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Though​ ">Tho'</span>​  indeed, from some points of view <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  you of all men realize most intensely, nothing surely can be more
                impressive than the unmeasured size

                &amp; colossal agglomeration of
                life in London—none the less felt <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="through​ ">thro</span>​ 
                the interminable streets when all
                are asleep, &amp; scarcely a passenger met athwart one's path. The interval when the
                streets are really deserted to this extent is but brief: I suppose from about 2¾ to
                4 a.m. is the most vacant time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What you say about the insulting &amp; in fact ungrateful treatment <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  your poems continue to receive in America is deeply interesting, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  painful. I suppose it is a very general if not universal experience that
                anything that is at once great &amp; extremely novel encounters for some
                considerable time much more hostility than acceptance, &amp; so far your experience
                is not surprising—rather indeed a testimonial, when properly considered, to
                the great intrinsic value of your writings. But certainly 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.029_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.029_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.029_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                it does seem that in degree &amp;
                duration the obduracy of Americans <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="against​ ">agst.</span>​  your work is something abnormal &amp; unworthy—especially
                considering the spirit of intense patriotic love &amp; national insight <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  pervades your book <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="through​ ">thro</span>​  &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="through​ ">thro.</span>​  That America <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  be so wanting (in this matter at least) in large receptiveness &amp; quick
                intuition is distressing to those who love her—among whom I may humbly but
                truly profess myself. It seems as if she were even <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">less</span>
                capable than others of appreciating great work vital with the very marrow of her
                bones &amp; corpuscles of her blood: perhaps this very affinity is partly the
                reason—but at any rate a bad &amp; perverse reason. In this country there are
                of course very diverse knots of opinion, &amp; schools of thinking &amp; criticism,
                &amp; to several of these your 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.030_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                works are still an exasperation &amp; an offence: but others
                accept &amp; exalt you with all readiness of love &amp; delight, &amp; I think I may
                safely say that it is these <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh</span>​  have in their holding the future of English opinion on such matters for
                some years to come.—But I will say no more on this tack. For myself (with
                others) who believe in you with the certainty of full conviction, all these
                considerations are poor &amp; slight: the one thing is the work itself, &amp; the
                maker of the work, which has a destiny as assured &amp; as limitless as that of any
                other great product of the soul or of nature.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have not met <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Professor​ ">Prof.r</span>​  Dowden since last summer (or spring perhaps): he is
                seldom, I think, out of Ireland. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.031_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.031_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.031_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                What I saw of him I liked
                particularly. He seems an uncommonly young man to be a Professor—less than 30
                to look at; &amp; is in no common degree good–looking, pleasant, open, &amp;
                sound–minded. There are few men, I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  say, more likely to have their sympathies in literary matters sane &amp;
                right—guided also by the fullest measure of lettered cultivation. Mrs.
                    Gilchrist I dined with not many weeks ago. She seems to
                have fairly recovered from a very exhaustive &amp; indeed dangerous illness that
                oppressed her of late (say from the early autumn of 1870 to the late summer of
                1871)—only that she is not so capable as she used to be of continuous mental
                or bodily strain. It was a pleasure to see her surrounded by her family, 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.032_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.032_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.032_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                the type of a true mother, guiding &amp; nurturing all aright in her children, mind &amp; body.
                The eldest son bids fair to have a distinguished &amp;
                prosperous career as a mining engineer: a younger son is
                greatly set on being a painter. One of the daughters is just
                about grown up, the other, I suppose, 10 or 11 years of
                age.—Mr. J. A. Symonds I don't know personally; but,
                about the time when my selection from your Poems came out, he
                wrote to me (2 or 3 letters) showing himself to have been for some while past one of
                your very ardent admirers. Tennyson I have known for years,
                &amp; like much: I think him deep–hearted &amp; high–minded, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho</span>​  it may be true (as has often been said, &amp; sometimes not in a kindly
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.033_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01889.033_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01889.033_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                present a very obtuse exterior to their advances or approaches: for myself, I can
                truly say my experience is the direct contrary. I think you &amp; he <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  understand each other, &amp; feel on a very friendly footing. Tennyson (as
                I dare say you know) is a remarkably fine manly person to look at, with a noble
                mould of face, &amp; very powerful frame. He must be 6 foot 1 in height, I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  suppose—but not now so erect as in his prime.—If you do at
                any time come to England, to see Tennyson or others, I need not say what a delight
                it <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  be to me to know you personally—&amp; several of my friends <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w.d</span>​  amply

                    sorrow is not fully the right word, nor the right

                    the lovers of Italian unity are beholden. It is often a pleasure to me to
