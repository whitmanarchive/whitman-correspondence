            <p class="tei_p">—I have put together the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Elias Hicks</span> fragments &amp; last night sent off the "paper" to
                the printer—not knowing how it will look in print—but with some fear
                &amp; trembling—then three or so pages (all done now) on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">George Fox</span>—evolutionary on the E[lias] H[icks]

                make from 120 to 130 (or possibly 135) pages—(those solid long primer pages
                eat up the copy at a terribly rate!)—I have not worried at it—&amp; do
                not—indeed it has probably been more benefit to me than hurt—I have been
                unspeakably helped by Horace Traubel—&amp; by the best printers I have ever
                yet had—The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> people have just sent me again
                my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army Hospitals &amp; Cases</span>
                proof—I judge it is intended for the October number—bowel movements
                continue every day or other day—I take no drugs at all—have not moved
                from my room yet—keep good spirits—young Dr. Mitchell has just
                come—weather pleasant continued—warmish but I am satisfied—Tom Harned comes every day, often bringing his nice always welcome children—</p>
