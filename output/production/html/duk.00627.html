            i have not felt very well lately i am
            troubled very much lately with the dispepsy
            which makes me feel pretty bad we have
            lived quite poor lately as they thought
            george wouldent get the boston work
            but yesterday he got a letter from davis
            giving him the work i dont know as
            it will make any difference but i doo
            feel sometimes if i could have something
            except the regular fare i should like it
            as my appetite has been not very good
            but i beleive people cant change
            when they get in such ways of saving
            to hear the talk you would think they were
            very much put to it george has had
            work for mr Lane he expects to get
            6 dollars a day for it all and 8 a day for
            the new york
                and he will get 5 per
                day for boston but mr Lanes work
                will be
            done before long i beleive)</p>
