                    1873 on the letter surface, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date

                    consistent with Louisa's living in Camden, New Jersey, with Walt's payment for
                    Edward Whitman's board, and with Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and daughters

                        he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began
                        working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through
                        the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St.

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917), who was the city engineer there from
                    1871 to 1880. Davis had worked with Jeff Whitman in Brooklyn, had joined Jeff in
                    St. Louis, and had served a brief stint in Lowell, Massachusetts
                    (1870–1871), before becoming the city engineer of Boston. Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman was also quite friendly with Davis, who had shared the Pacific
                    Street home before Jeff's departure in 1867 and had stopped by her house in
                    Brooklyn when working in Lowell (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00596">June 22,
                        1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman). Davis completed his career at American
                    Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see

                    served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
                    designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
                    engineer. George Washington Whitman's original connection to Lane was through
                    his brother Jeff Whitman: "jeff says as long as lane is in the [Brooklyn] water
                    works georgey will be" (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="tex.00178">June 15 or 16, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman). Lane resigned as Chief
                    Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works in 1869, and he soon became City Engineer
                    of Milwaukee ("Moses Lane," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Proceedings of the American
                        Society of Civil Engineers</span> [February 1882], 58). Like Joseph P. Davis
                    (above), Lane was loyal to George as a pipe inspector. The employment
                    opportunity for George in Milwaukee that Walt mentioned in his <a href="pml.00035">January 23–24, 1872</a> letter to Louisa was

                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
