            <p class="tei_p">Among the choice sights of those
                diggings, few are prettier than that of a fine ship, on a fine day, dashily entering
                or departing from our noble harbor! I saw the Hendrik Hudson come up yesterday
                afternoon, in beautiful trim, and her decks swarming with passengers. How pleasantly
                they must have been impressed with their new home—those of them who were emigrating
                here. Almost every day you can see these vessels coming in, with their human
                cargoes; and sometimes, two or three ships at once......The weather still continues
                beautiful; and it is said, from the country, that the late rains have furnished
                additional grazing to the cattle, which comes very welcome, after a long drought.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Hecker, a German republican, who has suffered some for free principles in the
                Grand Duchy of Baden, was received complimentarily here yesterday. New York, you
                know, opens her arms, and gives a "treat" to every visiter of the least distinction;
                and I like the practice. Mr. Hecker receives his friends in the Governor's room
                to-day....The Taylor meeting of the New York Cartmen at Vauxhall, last night, was a
                rouser indeed! David Paul Brown, W. H. Seward and Ogden Hoffman held forth. The
                Whigs, at least the prominent ones, are generally falling into the Taylor ranks....I
                notice a capital suggestion in one of the city papers: that the new line of Collins
                &amp; Co.'s ships be named, individually, after Irving, Prescott, Bancroft and 
                Bryant. Why are not our great writers as deserving of such honors as third rate politicians?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">During the last year there have been built in this city, about 50 large sewers, 30
                new piers, 115 new streets, including some which have been re-graded and paved: of
                the new public and private edifices, ships, and numerous such like enterprises,
                there could hardly be a catalogue made. We shall soon wrap Harlem and Manhattanville
                in our mantle; besides stretching an arm to Brooklyn, Jersey City and Williamsburg
                .... Mrs. Bishop is singing at the Park Theatre; but it is an up hill job there. The
                audiences are slim. Mr. Lover sailed for home in the Europa the other day. A band of
                25 musicians, a recent importation from Berlin, are giving concerts here....Among
                the boarders now at the Astor House is Gen. Harney. Military fame is, however, at a
                less grade, in the public estimation, here, than usual. This is noticeable at the
                theatres, where the appearance of the biggest military characters attract no
                attention......That story going the rounds of the papers, (from the Buffalo
                Commercial,) about a "man going over the falls," smacks too much of the
                penny-a-liner. It is a very pretty story as it stands; but one has no spare sympathy
                to expend these days....It is estimated by "E. M." the celebrated Brooklyn
                weather-man, who is up all night watching the clouds and thermometer, that the rain
                of the late storm here fell to the unusual depth of 5¾ inches....Korth, (Brooklyn,)
                whose case I have described in former letters, has been pronounced <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">guilty</span>, of
                assault with intent to murder, and will in all probability receive a pretty severe
                sentence....The mails for the Acadia, which left Boston on the 3d inst., did not get
                in from New York in time—including the great Southern mail. They will go out by the
                next steamer.</p>
