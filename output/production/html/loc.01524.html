        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I received your second letter to–day, also the Star. I sent you a letter
        Tuesday evening, which I suppose you have received. As I am now sitting in my room &amp;
        have no desire to go to bed yet, I will commence another. Give my best respects to George
          Smith—also to Pensey Bell &amp; his brother George—also to Mr. Shedd—and in
        fact to all my railroad friends, whenever they inquire after me—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I can almost see you drowsing &amp; nodding since last Sunday, going home
        late—especially as we wait there at 7th st. and I am telling you something deep about
        the heavenly bodies—&amp; in the midst of it I look around &amp; find you fast asleep,
        &amp; your head on my shoulder like a chunk of wood—an awful compliment to my
        lecturing powers. All the talk here now is either the war on the Rhine, or the murder of old Mr. Nathan, or
        some other murder—for there are plenty of them—I send you a couple of papers
        with pieces about them. Say whether they come safe. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I believe that is all for to–night, as it is getting late—Good night,
        Pete—Good night, my darling son—here is a kiss for you, dear boy—on the
        paper here—a good long one—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Thursday—4th—I have been out all the forenoon &amp; until about 2
        o'clock—had some business in New York, which I attended, then came back &amp; spent an
        hour &amp; a half on the river, with one of the pilots, a particular friend of
        mine—saw the yachts, several of them, including the America out practising, for the
        great race that comes off Monday—the Dauntless was out
        yesterday—&amp; the Cambria went down three days ago—the America is the
        handsomest little craft I ever laid eyes on—I also saw Henry Ward Beecher &amp; had some talk with him—I find myself going with the
        pilots muchly—there are several that were little boys, now grown up, &amp; remember me
        well—fine hearty fellows—always around the water—sons of old
        pilots—they make much of me—&amp; of course I am willing—</p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">10 o'clock at night</span>—As this is lying here on my table to be
        sent off tomorrow, I will imagine you with your arm around my neck saying Good night,
        Walt—&amp; me—Good night, Pete—</p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Friday morning Aug 5</span>. All well—fine weather &amp; I feel in
        good spirits—I am just going out, &amp; across to New York. </p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt.</span>
      </span>

      
        <p class="tei_p">We had a heavy shower here yesterday afternoon, 4th—the weather is not too hot
          here. </p>
