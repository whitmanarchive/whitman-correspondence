        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I received your second letter to–day, also the Star. I sent you a letter
        Tuesday evening, which I suppose you have received. As I am now sitting in my room &amp;
        have no desire to go to bed yet, I will commence another. Give my best respects to George
          Smith<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—also to Pensey Bell &amp; his brother George<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—also to Mr. Shedd<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—and in
        fact to all my railroad friends, whenever they inquire after me—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I can almost see you drowsing &amp; nodding since last Sunday, going home
        late—especially as we wait there at 7th st. and I am telling you something deep about
        the heavenly bodies—&amp; in the midst of it I look around &amp; find you fast asleep,
        &amp; your head on my shoulder like a chunk of wood—an awful compliment to my
        lecturing powers. All the talk here now is either the war on the Rhine,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> or the murder of old Mr. Nathan,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> or
        some other murder—for there are plenty of them—I send you a couple of papers
        with pieces about them. Say whether they come safe. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I believe that is all for to–night, as it is getting late—Good night,
        Pete—Good night, my darling son—here is a kiss for you, dear boy—on the
        paper here—a good long one—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Thursday—4th—I have been out all the forenoon &amp; until about 2
        o'clock—had some business in New York, which I attended, then came back &amp; spent an
        hour &amp; a half on the river, with one of the pilots, a particular friend of
        mine—saw the yachts, several of them, including the America out practising, for the
        great race that comes off Monday<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—the Dauntless was out
        yesterday—&amp; the Cambria went down three days ago—the America is the
        handsomest little craft I ever laid eyes on—I also saw Henry Ward Beecher<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> &amp; had some talk with him—I find myself going with the
        pilots muchly—there are several that were little boys, now grown up, &amp; remember me
        well—fine hearty fellows—always around the water—sons of old
        pilots—they make much of me—&amp; of course I am willing—</p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">10 o'clock at night</span>—As this is lying here on my table to be
        sent off tomorrow, I will imagine you with your arm around my neck saying Good night,
        Walt—&amp; me—Good night, Pete—</p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Friday morning Aug 5</span>. All well—fine weather &amp; I feel in
        good spirits—I am just going out, &amp; across to New York. </p>

          here. </p>
