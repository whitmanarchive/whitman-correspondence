            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I met Mr. Whitman a few evenings since. 
                He has received your letter of December 16th. 
                He duly received the previous ones also, making three letters from you. 
                He is entirely satisfied with your action, &amp; with Mr. Hotten's, 
                in regard to the London selection &amp; reprint, and seems pleased with 
                the condition into which that enterprise has been shaped. 
                He spoke with deep appreciation of you &amp; your letters.
