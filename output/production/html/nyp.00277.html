                He has received your letter of December 16th. 
                He duly received the previous ones also, making three letters from you.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> 
                He is entirely satisfied with your action, &amp; with Mr. Hotten's,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> 
                in regard to the London selection &amp; reprint, and seems pleased with 
                the condition into which that enterprise has been shaped. 
                He spoke with deep appreciation of you &amp; your letters.

                    <p class="tei_p">Perhaps because O'Connor's correspondence with William Michael Rossetti had
                        preceded his own, Walt Whitman encouraged his friend to reply to Rossetti's
                        letter of <a href="loc.01878">December 16, 1867</a>. When O'Connor
                        wrote to Rossetti on January 20, 1867, he included Whitman's paragraph with
                        only a few unimportant alterations; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti

                    when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a furor. Perhaps because
                    he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten introduced to an
                    English audience such writers as Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
                    and Bret Harte. After his death, his business was purchased by Chatto and
                    Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested
                    Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that
                    prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). Whitman consented to the sale of
                    Hotten's English edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/rossetti.html">Leaves of Grass</a></span> in his <a href="col.00001">February 17,
