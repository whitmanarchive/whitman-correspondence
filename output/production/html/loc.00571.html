                    daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
                    the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat

                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"

                    mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death
                    in 1873. During his mother's final illness, George Whitman and his wife Louisa
                    Orr Haslam Whitman took over Eddy's care, with financial support from Walt

                    fought Tom Sayers, the British Champion, in the "World Championship." The fight
                    was called by police before a knockout by either fighter. This fight would have
                    been of particular interest to the crowd at Pfaff's as Heenan was newly married
                    to Adah Isaacs Menken, a Pfaffian actress, writer, and admirer of Whitman. The
                    Democratic National Convention opened on April 23, 1860, in Charleston, South
                    Carolina. Northern and Southern Democrats were locked in a heated debate about
                    whether or not to officially add a pro-slavery plank to the platform. By April
                    30, Northern Democrats had won the argument, but fifty Southern delegates
                    stormed out in protest. Japan's first envoys to the United States—referred
                    to as the Japanese Embassy—arrived in San Francisco in March 1860. Their
                    progress cross-country was covered extensively in the press. The city-wide
                    celebration for the embassy's arrival in New York would serve as the subject of
