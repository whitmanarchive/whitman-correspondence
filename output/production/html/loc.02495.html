            <p class="tei_p">What a grand selection of portraits you have sent me! And oh, how I prize them not
                only for their intrinsic value &amp; interest but chiefly because they have come
                from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>. But I fear that you must have despoiled yourself
                in parting with some of them. Thanks to you all the more for your munificent
                kindness!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wallace called here for a few minutes last night, &amp; shewed
                me your p.c. to him. I gave him the duplicates &amp; a facsimile copy of your letter
                to me. I am having some of the portraits mounted; &amp; as the large head is fading
                I shall copy it so as to preserve it. That &amp; O'Connor's
                favourite are my favourites in the "budget"; but each of them is characteristically
                interesting &amp; I like &amp; value them all very much indeed.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I read the proof over hurriedly &amp; sent it on at once to Wallace &amp; I could not
                but admire its fidelity &amp; vivid portrayal of the actual event &amp; much credit
                is due to H.L. Traubel &amp; the reporter for so admirably

                &amp; for all the good words you said about Wallace &amp; the Boys. My only fear is
                that, after the laudation we have received, Dr Bucke will be
                disappointed when he sees us!</p>
