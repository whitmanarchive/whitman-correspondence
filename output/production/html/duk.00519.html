                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. The
                    connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
                    under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
                    Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
                    in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her <a href="duk.00547">July 8,
                        1868</a> letter reported Jeff Whitman's confidence that George's
                    connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. George's position
                    with the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous in 1869 after the
                    reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners in April: Lane
                    resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00578">April 7, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman). Lane later designed and
                    constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer, and he
                    again employed George to inspect pipe in Camden, New Jersey ("Moses Lane," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</span>

                    the Browns and the Whitmans was often strained, especially in regard to the
                    noise made by Jeff and Mattie's daughter Hattie, but the Browns remained in the

                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
