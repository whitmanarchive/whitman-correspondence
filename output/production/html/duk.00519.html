                has written to the pension bureau
                and got an answer that there

                from Jeff

                he is very busy he says they have moovd
                and are all better than they were at the
                hotel)

                heyde what i wrote about hans
                coming
                has stirred him up this letter is much
                better than the others he wishes you and
