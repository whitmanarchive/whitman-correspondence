            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours I received yesterday  I also had a lettr from Mat to-day<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>  As you can imagine I am very glad to get news from home—I was glad you sent me Mothers letter—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In regard to the house I think too that it is far better to do as you propose and build on George's lot—twill be a home and a good one too I think for Mother<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—I see from Matts letter that they are going to be turned out from their place there—that Olmstead<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> and all the rest are a mean set of cusses as ever lived—there is no need of their wanting the house</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hav'nt written to Kingsly<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> yet—am thinking of perhaps some other way of raising the money—anyway I am pretty sure—indeed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">am</span> sure that it can be had—how soon will you want it? write me about it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad you went home<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>  I guess it did Mother and all of them a great deal of good—Mat writes that she is going out to hire rooms as soon as she can  It seems to me d—m mean that they manage to want the whole of that big house  It looks more like being a little ugly than anything else—I wish Mattie would be a little stiff with them—the Bullards<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I mean the people that are going to move in—the d—m cusses shant have my water pipe unless the[y] behave decent—yet I suppose the Park people are mean enough to prevent my taking it up—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Matters are beginning to get into shape with me—I am in need of Davis<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> very much—I have been urging him to come as soon as possible but received a letter to-day saying that he could not possibly get here before the 15th of June if then—I hope however that he will certainly get here by that time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Kirkwood<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> left me this morning—he has been here since Saturday—The Board of Commis[sio]ners I like very much—they do just whatever I ask—at once—indeed almost too much so.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> I begin to feel as if I should get along if I have decent luck—Yet it is hard to say what will turn up—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I manage to get the N. York papers pretty regularly now. I had the Times of Friday while eating my Breakfast on Sunday—that is pretty well isnt it. The weather is quite cool—but nevertheless vegetation is getting forward fast—and just out side the city—where we are to build part of our new works, matters look perfectly beautiful. I hope you will be able to come on here and make me a visit if I stay here long—I begin to like the city better—Yet it dont come up to B[rooklyn] by a long chalk—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my regards to Mr and Mrs O'Connor<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a>—write me as often as you can</p>

                    Walt, Jeff indicated that everything was "going abt as usual," an innocuous
                    phrase which hid the frustrations of his life. His career had stagnated, money
                    was short, and he was still living at home. His mother thought he looked "bad"
                    and needed "a month of leave from all cares and anxieties"; she noted, too, that
                    he suffered "nervous spells sometimes and is quite moody" (Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman to Walt Whitman, June 7, 1866, and January 17, 1867 [Trent Collection,
                    William R. Perkins Library, Duke University]). Jeff's depression must have
                    worsened on March 15, 1867, when he attended the funeral of his good friend Dr.
                    Edward Ruggles, whose absence he would long lament (see <a href="loc.00447">Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman, 12 July 1868</a>).<p class="tei_p">In the
                        month following this low point, Jeff's life changed abruptly. On March 26,
                        James P. Kirkwood, his former boss in Brooklyn, recommended that Jeff
                        replace him as chief engineer of the new St. Louis Water Works, a system
                        Kirkwood had designed for the state Board of Water Commissioners and the
                        city council. By April an offer had been made and Jeff discussed it with
                        William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor quickly relayed this information to Walt
                        who urged his brother "to accept the offer, &amp; go, by all means" (Edwin
                        Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                        New York University Press, 1961-77], 1:326).</p><p class="tei_p">Jeff reported for work in
                        St. Louis on May 7, 1867. He was initially uncertain whether this would be a
                        permanent move: he left Mattie and the children in the East and asked Walt
                        to visit only "if I stay here long." But he liked the energetic young city,
                        the companionship of prominent men like Henry Flad, the excitement of a
                        large project, and the improved salary—in Brooklyn he made two hundred
                        dollars per month, in St. Louis three hundred and thirty. Quickly he assumed
                        the responsibilities that would dominate the next twenty years of his life,
                        the task of building and supervising a waterworks as extensive as that in
                        Brooklyn.</p><p class="tei_p">The plans called for drawing muddy water from the
                        Mississippi, allowing it to settle in reservoirs, and then pumping it into a
                        sprawling distribution system. Partly because the city council had rejected
                        Kirkwood's original location for the works and insisted on a less expensive
                        site nearer the city, Jeff was plagued with such problems as poor soil for
                        foundations and periodic flooding from the river. By drawing freely on the
                        expertise of his old friend Joseph P. Davis and the government publications
                        sent him by William Douglas O'Connor, he overcame these obstacles and
                        completed the job on schedule in 1871.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00444_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00444_n2"><span>Walt Whitman's letter
