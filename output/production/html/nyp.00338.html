      <p class="tei_p">I will write you just a line—it is still the same with me—the same strange alternations—not perhaps quite as well, of late, (the last ten or twelve days)—&amp; yet I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dontdon't​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​

        from 10 to 12—probably overdid matters—as I came back sick &amp; have been so since—(though not enough to prevent me from eating some nice stewed oysters in moderation

      <p class="tei_p">When you write tell me about my dear Mr &amp; Mrs. Ashton—I wrote them a line off-hand,
