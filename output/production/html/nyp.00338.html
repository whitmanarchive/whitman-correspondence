        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I will write you just a line—it is still the same with me—the same strange alternations—not perhaps quite as well, of late, (the last ten or twelve days)—&amp; yet I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dontdon't​ </span></span> abandon 
        my anchorage of heart &amp; hope—<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dontdon't​ </span></span> <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">feel to</span>, which is a main thing with me—I have a good deal of pain, more or less steady, in my left side—in addition 
        to the bad spells in the head—To-day has been pleasant, &amp; I was out hobbling around 
        from 10 to 12—probably overdid matters—as I came back sick &amp; have been so since—(though not enough to prevent me from eating some nice stewed oysters in moderation 
        for my dinner, a half hour since)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">So <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dontdon't​ </span></span> be needlessly apprehensive, Nelly dear—for I shall get better, &amp; we will meet yet—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">When you write tell me about my dear Mr &amp; Mrs. Ashton—I wrote them a line off-hand, 
        which I suppose they <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ . Tell me all the news—tell me about Charles Eldridge—&amp; all my other friends.
