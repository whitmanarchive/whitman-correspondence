                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

                    though, not especially perceptive—the response of an idolator who admired
                    the person as much as the poet: "With 'November Boughs' the work of Walt Whitman
                    may be considered finished. The age of the poet (he was born in 1819), his
                    infirmity, the suggestive title of the volume, and the character of its contents
                    all indicate that it is the final word, the last farewell, of one who awaits
                    death with the tranquil mind and the clear vision of the prophet. . . . It is
                    impossible to contemplate the life of this man, with a thorough knowledge of his
                    work or even with an imperfect realization of it, without experiencing a feeling
                    of profound and reverential respect. But we are too near him now to get other
                    than an imperfect view of him: his personality is so great that it crowds the
                    narrow field of our vision; to be adequately grasped and appreciated he must be
                    seen in the perspective of at least one hundred years. His figure then will be
                    sharply outlined against the background of history, and the future will see with
                    unshaded eye and in a light softened and tempered by time that of which the
                    present can get but a partial view." (Edwin Haviland Miller credits the Newberry
