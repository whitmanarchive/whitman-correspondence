                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am delighted with a great rain storm which has 
                just come up &amp; has forced us to send the horses back to the stable,
                because it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">gaves​ </span><span class="tei_corr">gave​
        
      </span></span> me a chance of sending a note to thee by this mid week's post 
                to <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">thamk​ </span><span class="tei_corr">thank​
        
      </span></span> thee for thy postal card of 
                Aug. 4th, with its good news of strength to stand "The hottest day of the season."</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish we could import a little of our cool, not to say 
                cold, weather to the other side of the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Allantic​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Atlantic​
        
      </span></span>. 
                The newspapers all speak of it as the 'bleak weather of July &amp; August' &amp; we have all
                been really suffering with cold almost ever since we came up to Wales. Still we have so many out-of-door 
                pursuits that we like it better than very hot weather. We have discovered a boat on the lake, &amp; have 
                found out that the water is not too cold for bathing, &amp; we have put the tennis court in order, so that 
                in the brief intervals between the showers, we have a great many things to do. This week, however, the 'children'
                have deserted us: They have all gone off to Cornwall to be with a party of young Quakers who always assemble at 
                Falmouth for the month of August. So 
                Papa &amp; the baby &amp; Frank &amp; I are left to our own devices.
                I cannot say we have done anything that savours of marked originality so far, as Frank &amp; I have spent nearly 
                our whole time doing work on the markets commission. I am engaged in a fierce contest with this typewriter, but
                I think I shall soon have conquered it far enough to write a respectable letter. At present I have to spell 
                every <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">wordl​ </span><span class="tei_corr">word​
        
      </span></span> laboriously though, so I cannot say anything, I am afraid, 
                to interest thee. But at any rate I can 
                send warmest love from Papa &amp; myself &amp; tell thee that we <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">think&amp;​ </span><span class="tei_corr">thank 
                    &amp;​
        
      </span></span> talk constantly of thee.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Thy loving friend,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Mary Whitall Costelloe</span>
            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">
                The rain has just cleared away, so I shall drive with this to the post.  
                </p>
