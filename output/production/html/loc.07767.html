                    (1833–1912) was the distinguished editor of the Variorum Shakespeare, and
                    was one of the honorary pallbearers at Whitman's funeral. See also Horace

                        1890</a>, Whitman sent Furness a copy of "O Captain! My Captain!"
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See also
                    Whitman's <a href="pml.00066">April 30, 1890</a>, letter to Dr. Silas Weir
                    Mitchell, a physician specializing in nervous disorders. Furness was somewhat
                    snide in a letter he wrote to English poet Edmund Gosse on March 29, 1892, three
                    days after the poet's death: "Let us hope that he is now more favourably
                    situated than erstwhile for giving a 'yawp over the roofs of the world.' I
                    should be sorry to think that the yawp would reverberate through our cellars.
                    I'm not sure that the very best of Walt was not his Jovian looks. Latterly when
                    I used to see him in his room, with that majestic avalanche of a beard flowing
                    in snowy luxuriousness over his broad chest, it was not hard to convert his blue
                    wrapper into blue sky and the vast &amp; innumerable newspapers piled knee deep
                    around him in[to] the clouds of Olympus. And, oh, the lot of funny stories about
                    him, gossip pure &amp; simple but nourishing, which 'twould take too long to
                    write &amp; must be reserved for the pleasant time when you &amp; I can ha'e a
                    crack thegither." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n3">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07767_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="loc.07767_n3"><span>This correspondence card
                    apparently accompanied a transcription of "O Captain! My Captain!," which

                    Henry Furness (1802–1896), a Unitarian minister in Philadelphia, visited
                    the poet on April 10, 1890. See Whitman's letter to the Canadian physcian
