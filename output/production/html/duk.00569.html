                        August 13–16, 1863. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman received George
                        Washington Whitman's <a href="duk.00343">July 23, 1863</a> letter from
                        Milldale, Mississippi, and she forwarded it to Walt Whitman with this brief
                        note. Edwin Haviland Miller dated Louisa's letter "after" July 23?, 1863
                        (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1961–77], 1:373), but this brief note from Louisa
                        must date to mid-August 1863. In his <a href="loc.00783">August 18,
                            1863</a> letter to Louisa, Walt acknowledged "George's letter." Miller
                        associated that letter loosely with George's <a href="duk.00344">August
                            16, 1863</a> letter from Kentucky—at least insofar as it
                        indicates George's location—but the forwarded letter from George that
                        Walt received in mid-August is almost certainly this one. Walt's August 18
                        letter cannot acknowledge George's August 16, 1863 letter because Louisa
                        postponed forwarding that letter for several days while she awaited an
                        express packet (see her <a href="duk.00570">August 22 or 23?, 1863</a>
                        letter to Walt).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">George's July 23 letter had been long delayed by his extended expedition from
                        Kentucky to Mississippi with Ambrose Burnside's Ninth Corps (see Jerome M.
                        Loving, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters of George Washington
                            Whitman</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 97).
                        According to Thomas Jefferson Whitman's <a href="loc.00419">August 4,
                            1863</a> letter to Walt, "we do not hear from George." Walt had not
                        received word from George a week later: "I feel so anxious to hear from
                        George, one cannot help feeling uneasy" (see his <a href="loc.00781">August 11, 1863</a> letter to Louisa). George's August 16, 1863
                        letter confirms that his July 23, 1863 letter to his mother was the most
                        recent he had sent.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Since Walt acknowledged George's forwarded letter and another letter (not
                        extant) that Louisa promised to send the following day (see Walt's August
                        18, 1863 letter to Louisa), this letter dates to August 13–16,
                        1863.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00569_n2 note" id="duk.00569_n2"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
                    August 14–17, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman is not extant. She shared news
                    of Andrew Jackson Whitman's continuing struggle with a throat condition (he had
                    lost his voice) and an abusive letter from son-in-law Charles L. Heyde. She
                    presumably also inquired whether Walt had written his sister Hannah Heyde,
                    Charles's wife, about George Washington Whitman's letter and informed Walt that
                    she had shared his Washington address with Emma Price, the daughter of Abby
                    Price (see Walt's <a href="loc.00783">August 18, 1863</a> letter to

                    Velsor Whitman, from Milldale, Mississippi. George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
