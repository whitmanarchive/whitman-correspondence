            <p class="tei_p">I am very glad indeed, &amp; thankful, for all the capital suggestions &amp;
                amendments you have made. I have followed them all, or am doing it. I have a good
                many little additions to make myself—things which the close work of
                concordance-making suggested to me. I will cut out everything you advise. As
                to Ballou &amp; Scovel, I will cut out nearly
                everything of Ballou's retaining only a little to put with large quotations from
                Scovel's article. I can improve that personal chapter very much by working it over,
                smoothing down &amp; melding things together more. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">How wd that MS—"Of That Blithe Throat" &amp;c—You gave me, do for a fac-simile page

                Bibliography where I speak of your typographical finesse &amp;c? Or wd you prefer 
                to send me a clean draft of something in case the publishers
                thought best to give the fac-simile? People like to see the erasures &amp;c I
                believe. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have thought that I might perhaps get more from Chatto &amp; Windus if I guaranteed
                them for three years against the republication of the book in this country. I am
                going to copyright it, here right away, or very soon. What wd you say to this—guaranteeing the British publisher the market? </p>
            <span class="tei_ab"> An error in L. of G. </span>
            <p class="tei_p">By the way I suppose of course you have noticed that the characters "§ 9" of the
                Salut are by mistake omitted in L. of G.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have a nice letter form Scovel wh. I shall answer. </p>

                <p class="tei_p"> If Morse makes a bust satisfactory to you, I shall have
