                    that "one of the things of which I am most proud is that the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> was the first publication of its class to invite Walt Whitman
                    to contribute to its pages" (see Charles N. Elliot, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman as Man, Poet, and Friend</span> [1915], 97); she was assisted in her
                    editorial tasks by her brother Joseph. For more information, see Susan L.

                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span> stated that "Walt Whitman has many
                    characteristics of Hugo. Like him Whitman began with very simple rhymes in
                    ordinary metres and in later life broke through all the rules. About 1850 Hugo
                    seems to have learned in the school of adversity the beauty of democratic
                    principles which came to Whitman naturally through his birth and education."
                    Whitman had always liked being compared to Hugo and even urged William Sloane
                    Kennedy to include a comparison to the French writer in his essay on Whitman. On
                    the latter, see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of <a href="rut.00005">May 24,
                        1885</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
