                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
                    businesses in 1881–82. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after opposition from the Boston
                    District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the original publisher,
                    to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days &amp;
