          <span class="tei_salute">My dear Edmund Yates,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Pardon me for my forgetfulness about the pictures. I send you three, to make it up. 
        I have been putting off every thing—forgetting every thing—till I feel well again—for I am still in a pretty bad way—but shall come round again by-and-by, 
        with the blessing of God—And so, (as Mr. Philp's messenger is waiting) I shake hands across—&amp; abruptly bid you good bye, for this time.
      </p>
