            <p class="tei_p"> I am going out to a small dinner party of friends, &amp;
                am sitting here in my 3d story room waiting for half an hour— </p>  
            <p class="tei_p"> —I have not heard from your folks directly—but a man at the ferry, (a
                relation of Joe Brownings) told me that "Debbie had had
                a baby, &amp; that it was buried last Sunday." I asked
                him how Debbie was getting along since, &amp; he said he believed pretty
                well—but I suppose you have heard more fully &amp; exactly from
                home—Nothing else to write about specially—we have had over three weeks
                of severe winter weather, storms &amp;c—many wrecks on the coast—I am
                glad you keep well &amp; in good spirits—pray God it may continue so, &amp;
                believe it will—Good bye for this time, dear Hank—</p>
