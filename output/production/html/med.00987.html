            <p class="tei_p">Imagine the highest state of excitement you ever saw in
                this city "on the eve of an important electtion," then multiply it by three, and you
                may realize some-thing of the California gold excitement<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">1</a> now pervading nearly all
                classes of our "society." Since the publication of the documents accompanying the
                President's message, the flames have spread with tremendous intenseness, and to a
                very wide extent. Perhaps it is safe to say that at least <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">one-third</span> of the mechanics
                and young working-men are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">trying</span> to go to California. Of course many will be unable
                to get the requisite means; for two or three hundreds dollars in ready cash is not
                as common as "common people" are themselves. Of this one-third however, a very large
                proportion will probably succeed, through dint of borrowing, begging, selling off,
                (many times at a sacrifice,) or even by more questionable means; for it has been
                discovered, in more than a few cases, that the California fever blinds some of its
                victims to the laws of strict honesty.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Gold! gold! how thou are worshipped by the
                human "critter"! What will not man undergo to clutch thee! And yet how truly have
                poets sung and philosophers said, since the world began, that thou art unable to
                make a man really happy! Still, a few drops of thee—say about a hundred and twenty
                five pounds, Troy weight, (as it is best to be specified,)—wouldn't come amiss to
                one who scribbles for his bread and butter. The pen may be mightier than the sword;
                but, candidly and without clap-trap, gold is a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">guid</span> bit stronger than both pen and
                sword. Proof: the two latter a thousand times doubled, couldn't draw folks half so
                fast toward those distant shores of the Pacific, as the sight of a few shining
                little lumps that went off the other day to the Philadelphia Mint. But I dare say
                you see the same thing exemplified, in pretty nearly the same way, in New Orleans.
                Human nature is just the same ("with a difference") all over the world. It is the
                same, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">without</span> the difference, in respect to greediness for the aforesaid gold.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thus
                far, the session of Congress has produced no sensation. Some significant moves, it
                is true, have been made in the House of Representatives; but it rarely happens that
                the Congress which sits immediately before the advent of a new Administration takes
                very important steps. We here think not much of the doings at Washington. We
                exhausted all our available sympathies during the two months preceding the election,
                and look on politics for a while yet with apathy.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Still does the cholera<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">2</a> linger at
                Staten Island, like some bore of a visiter—such <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">as will</span> come at times even into the
                editorial holy of holies. It lingers, and will not be gone, although sixty-five
                doctors have been down to see it. After this, no one knows what it will be able to
                stand, perhaps even the severest of frosts.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The destruction of the Park Theatre on
                Saturday night, still remains unaccounted for, as to the origin of the fire. Do you
                know there has long been a standing tradition that a deadly enemy of Hamblin<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">3</a> has
                pursued him for years, moved thereto by a fiendish oath to incendiarize every
                theatre the said Hamblin shall control. The insurance offices ought to offer a
                reward for that chap, as he does <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">them</span> more harm than he does "the old man." My
                impression is clearly that Hamblin's insurance will cover his losses—though the
                papers state the contrary.</p>

                John A. Sutter to build a sawmill in what is today Coloma, California. Marshall found several pieces
                of gold, and the news of Marshall's discovery was the beginning of the California
                Gold Rush (1848–1855). The Gold Rush brought hundreds of thousands of people to 
                California in search of gold. As a result of the rapid growth, California was able to enter the Union as a free state
                as part of the Compromise of 1850, while Native Californians and indigenous
                societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by those seeking their fortunes in gold. </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n5"><span>Cholera is a bacterial

                Under his management, New York City's Bowery Theatre became a successful venue for American working-class theatre. Hamblin occasionally booked opera
                and ballet events, but primarily produced melodramas, romances, farces, and circus acts that appealed to the working class Bowery B'hoy audiences
                of the Bowery district. In 1848, Hamblin bought the lease to the Park Theatre, which he renovated and reopened; however, the theatre was destroyed by fire
                a few months later. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
