            <p class="tei_p">Yours of March 29 rec'd &amp; welcomed—I sent you a
                request for two or three printed slips of the Preface, when in type—also some
                of the "additional note"—Keep your eyes open sharp to any little technical or
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sentence</span> alterations of the text of "Spec: Days in
                America" for your Ed'n—as the book was printed rather hurriedly here for the
                America area, without tho't of foreign reprint—If you have any frontispiece
                portrait, try to have a good one—else none at all w'd be best—the one in
                y'r little L of G is bad—I go on to New York (if I can get there) to deliver
                my "Death of Lincoln" lecture—</p>
