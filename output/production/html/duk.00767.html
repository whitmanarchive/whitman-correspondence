                    Stansberry, a former soldier whom Whitman had met in Armory Square Hospital,
                    wrote on <a href="duk.00765">December 9, 1873</a>, from Howard Lake,
                    Minn., and recalled "the Blackbery [Jam?] you gave me &amp; all the kindness
                    which you shown." After Whitman replied on April 27, 1874 (lost), Stansberry
                    wrote again on <a href="duk.00766">May 12, 1874</a>, about the hospital
                    visits. On <a href="duk.00764">July 15, 1874</a>, his wife informed
                    Whitman of her husband's failing health and poverty and inquired about the
                    possibility of a pension. Evidently in reply to another lost letter from
                    Whitman, Stansberry asked on <a href="duk.00768">July 21, 1875</a> for
                    "the Lone of 65$" in order to return to West Virginia, where he expected to
                    find witnesses to support his application for a pension. This was evidently the
                    last letter in the correspondence. These letters are in the Trent Collection,

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in
                    his <a href="yal.00260">January 26, 1873</a>, letter to his mother, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office. See also his <a href="med.00418">March 21, 1873</a>, letter to his mother. </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li></ul>
