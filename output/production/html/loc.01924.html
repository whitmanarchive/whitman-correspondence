                    letter to Peter Eckler). Simpson wrote on <a href="loc.01924">May 10,
                        1867</a>, that he was going into business for himself and was interested
                    in publishing Whitman's next book: "Hearing you are writing another book [I]

                    have established a Ptng &amp; Publishing House." But, in his <a href="loc.01926">July 3, 1867</a>, letter, he advised Whitman that after
                    consultation "with several eminent literary men . . . though we are favorably
                    impressed, . . . we deem it injudicious to commit ourselves to its publication

                    (1828–1900), F. S. Hoffman, and "Abe" Simpson joined with B. W. Bond (of
                    the publishing firm Moorhead, Simpson &amp; Bond) to form the Agathynian Club,
                    which printed both original works and reprints with an interest in typographical
                    innovation. The Club produced periodicals, as well as reprints of rare, curious,
                    and old American, English, French, and Latin books (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American

                    9:136). While preparing the Agathynian Club's second volume, a fire destroyed
                    the Bradstreet book-bindery, all 150 copies of the Club's second volume, and by
                    extension the Club itself, which folded in 1868 when Hammond elected to focus on
                    his medical practice. For more information on the Club, see Adolf Growell, "The
