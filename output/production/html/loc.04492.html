                    Williamson about purchasing manuscripts (see the letter from Williamson to
                    Whitman of October 6, 1888), Whitman remarked to Horace Traubel: "I would like
                    to humor Williamson but don't see how I can do it. He will have to content his
                    'happy owner' soul with patience: I can give him no hope. That whole mania for
                    collecting things strikes me as an evidence of disease—sometimes of
                    disease in an acute form: though I know Williamson for an exceptional man in a
                    bad crowd. And indeed, that is what makes a remarkable matter more
                    remarkable—that a man such as we know Williamson to be should care a damn
                    whether he was the happy owner of a manuscript—any manuscript—or
                    not. Well, give him my love: that is real: and if he is satisfied to be the
                    happy owner of my love he owns it—tell him so—and welcome, welcome"
                    (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.84.html">Saturday, 
                        October 6th, 1888</a>, 442). In 1891, however, Whitman sent Williamson
                    manuscript drafts of several poems, including "Old Age's Ship and Crafty
                    Death's" and "A Twilight Song." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
