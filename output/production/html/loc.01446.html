      <p class="tei_p">I must first render you thanks for the box of books, as they have at
        last reached me in good condition—The delay in their arrival is unaccountable. But
        they are welcome, and will all be read in due time, and with sincere gratitude to the donor.
        Both your letters also reached me, and were cordially welcomed. I should have acknowledged
        them at date, only that for many weeks I have been disabled from writing &amp; from any
        clerical work, by reason of a wound in the right hand, which is now better. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new or noteworthy in my own affairs. I still remain in the Attorney
        General's office here—still enjoying good health. I keep fashioning &amp; shaping my
        books at my leisure, &amp; hope to put them in type the current year. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">You speak of my prose preface to first "Leaves of Grass." I am unable to send it you,
        having not a copy left. It was written hastily while the first edition was being printed in
        1855—I do not consider it of permanent value. I shall send
        you, (probably in the mail that follows this—certainly very soon,) a piece written
        some while since by me on "Democracy"—in which Mr.
        Carlyle's "shooting Niagara" is alluded to. I shall also send an
        article by an English lady, put in print here, that may interest
        you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this at my desk in the Treasury building here, an immense pile, in which our
        office occupies rooms. From my large open window I have an extensive view of sky, Potomac
        river, hills &amp; fields of Virginia, many, many miles. We are having a spell of that
        oppressive heat which so much falls upon us here. </p>
