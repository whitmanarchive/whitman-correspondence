      <p class="tei_p">I must first render you<a href="#n0196" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0196">3</a> thanks for the box of books, as they have at
        last reached me in good condition—The delay in their arrival is unaccountable. But
        they are welcome, and will all be read in due time, and with sincere gratitude to the donor.
        Both your letters also reached me, and were cordially welcomed. I should have acknowledged
        them at date, only that for many weeks I have been disabled from writing &amp; from any
        clerical work, by reason of a wound in the right hand, which is now better. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new or noteworthy in my own affairs. I still remain in the Attorney
        General's office here—still enjoying good health. I keep fashioning &amp; shaping my
        books at my leisure, &amp; hope to put them in type the current year. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">You speak of my prose preface to first "Leaves of Grass." I am unable to send it you,
        having not a copy left. It was written hastily while the first edition was being printed in
        1855—I do not consider it of permanent value.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> I shall send
        you, (probably in the mail that follows this—certainly very soon,) a piece written
        some while since by me on "Democracy"<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>—in which Mr.
        Carlyle's "shooting Niagara"<a href="#n0139" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0139">6</a> is alluded to. I shall also send an
        article by an English lady,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">7</a> put in print here, that may interest
        you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this at my desk in the Treasury building here, an immense pile, in which our
        office occupies rooms. From my large open window I have an extensive view of sky, Potomac
        river, hills &amp; fields of Virginia, many, many miles. We are having a spell of that
        oppressive heat which so much falls upon us here. </p>

                        uneducated corkcutter of Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's
                        early English admirers. In 1856 he had bought copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> from a book peddler; one of these copies was later
                        sent by William B. Scott to William Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously
                        supported cultural projects and was in effect the ideal laborer of Ruskin,
                        who printed many of his letters to the corkcutter in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Time
                            and Tide</span> (1867). See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Autobiographical Notes of
                            the Life of William Bell Scott</span>, ed. W. Minto (1892), 2:32–33,

                    <p class="tei_p">On the basis of the lengthy correspondence of this impassioned man now
                        preserved in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                        Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., it seems
                        clear that Dixon must have written to Walt Whitman in 1869 or earlier and
                        asked him to inquire about the whereabouts of his sister. (Walt Whitman's
                        reply is apparently lost.) They exchanged photographs at this time, Dixon's
                        being dated October, 1869. In Dixon's first extant letter, dated <a href="loc.01445">December 23, 1869</a>, he wrote: "I love nearly all
                        the Men thou lovest, and all the Books and thoughts that seem congenial to
                        thee, long hath been so to me. I gaze at the Sea while I eat my food and
                        think of thee. . . . and often while I gaze thereon I think of thee, and how
                        thou loves that Sea, and how to thee it hath been more then to me." On
                        January 9, 1870, Dixon informed Rossetti that he was enclosing a copy of
                        Walt Whitman's portrait, and that Walt Whitman had sent "a very nice letter
                        of sympathy for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mother's death</span>, and of friendship to
                        me" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span>, 508). In June, Dixon sent books
                        which included Mazzini, Carlyle, and various works on oriental religion. He
                        asked for Walt Whitman's opinion of them on <a href="loc.01452">July 27,
                            1871</a>. The fervor of the corkcutter was evident in his letter of
                            <a href="loc.01447">September 8, 1874</a>: "Ruskin is also working
                        hard too to help on a nobler life, and one not much unlike the one you also
                        long to see. so many souls laboring for one end must someday effect the
                        accomplishment of the 'Golden Days' so long sung, so long toiled for, prayed
                        for—and fought for!!" When Walt Whitman wrote again to Dixon in 1876
                        (the letters are not known), the latter resumed the correspondence with his
                        customary intensity. "I see thee now while I write this," he wrote on <a href="loc.01460">February 16, 1876</a>. "I look into thine eyes. I
                        grasp thy hand. Thou grasps it hard, thou looks upon me with a smile. I hear
                        thee say: 'All is peace now, young man, the Storm is indeed past. I live
                        once again in the Souls and memories of these Hero's and all is Well!'"
                        Later, on <a href="loc.01462">June 17, 1876</a>, he reported that in
                        addition to selling and circulating many copies he had placed Walt Whitman's
                        poem in the town libraries at Shields, Manchester, New Castle, Warrington,
                        Liverpool, and Plymouth. "So you see," he concluded modestly, "the little
                        band's been a Working one."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n0196">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0196 note" id="n0196"><span>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
