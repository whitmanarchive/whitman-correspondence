                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> One of your always welcome &amp; ever venerated tokens has
                reached me here tonight (closely following a predecessor);
                in the shape of "The Critic" for Nov 8, containing lines by you, which show that
                the old Master has not lost his own inimitable cunning.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I also hear from a dear friend of mine Edward Clifford
                that he has been seeing you, &amp; (what is very valuable news) that he has made a
                drawing of you. This I shall get a sight of, doubtless, soon after his return to
                England—in photograph at least. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Now I want to tell you why it is I have never lately sent you tokens in the shape of
                work by me. It is not from want of love for you, not because I am not always in
                communion with you:—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> I am, &amp; so are all my
                friends; there is a fine young fellow, son of Col Brackenbury, lying dead now in my neighbor's house, whose mother
                brought <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00326_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00326_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00326_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> me back
                to day a copy of Leaves of Grass <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">h.</span></span>​  I had lent him last March &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">h.</span></span>​  had been his constant companion ever since. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> No: it is not that I do not love you, &amp; do not dwell with you, that I have sent
                no token of my work. One reason is that I judge my work unworthy of you in the first
                place, &amp; in the second place so contrary to your canons of literary production that
                I can hardly imagine you can care for it. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Now, however, I hurl from 3 several publishers three little books at your devoted
                (most sacred) head:—just to show you that the chord of sympathy <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">h.</span></span>​  finds me as disciple in soul to you is still <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_kb">glowing</span>; even though the
                conditions in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">h.</span></span>​  I have been developed, prevent me from following your precepts further
                than in the resolute endeavor to be sincere &amp; thorough. </p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00327_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00327_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00327_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p"> You will see that I have stamped my two books of Sonnets with the heraldic coat
                borne by my ancestors for the last five hundred years. The 3 trefoils signify for me
                "The Whole, the Good, the Beautiful," as is shown by the motto from Goethe. You may
                not object to the "feudalism" of these arms, if I tell you that our patriot John
                    Hampden bore them by right of his wife (my
                Maternal ancestress), &amp; that Samuel Symonds
                brought them to America in 1639 or thereabouts as <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Deputy Governor​ ">Depty Gov<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span></span>​ . of New England under Winthrop. He gave the names to Ipswich &amp;
                Toppesfield (ancestral places of England) in that state. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have made this discourse to conquer any prejudice <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">h</span>.</span>​  you might feel against books
                stamped with so effete &amp; obsolete a gimcrack as a coat of arms! One Sonnet on p:
                145 of "Vagabunduli Libellus" explains the meaning of that coat for me. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> In sections "Among the Mountains" &amp; "Envoy to a Book", you will find many
                Sonnet-references to my life up here, 5200 feet above sea-level. It is not a bad
                life. I have wife &amp; children around me, home of my own, nearly all the peasants
                for familiar <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00328_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00328_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00328_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                friends (especially young fellows, drivers, teamsters, post officials, farmers),
                &amp; have besides a heap of books &amp; plenty of literary work to do—this last,
                however, not remunerative. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I suffer from a chronic disease of the lungs, the result of breaking an artery
                seven years ago while riding a stubborn horse in England. But I find that much
                exercise in the open air &amp; regular habits give me a fair amount of physical
                vigour yet; enough to enjoy the society of simple folk &amp; to carry on the sort of
                work I have selected. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I will send you photos of my house, myself (done by Clifford), &amp; 3 of my
                daughters. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am sincerely glad to hear that you are still tolerably hearty &amp; around among
                your friends. Believe me most sincerely yours </p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p"> I always feel Calamus more deeply than any part of your work; &amp; the reason
                    why I have not published much that I have written about your poems, is that I
                    cannot get quite to the bottom of Calamus. I wish I had your light upon it! </p>
