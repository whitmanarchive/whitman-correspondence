                    <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">In New York on Thursday I saw Marvin and was glad to hear from you through him.—He said
                    you had not seen the Nation review of Dr Buckes book and had expressed a desire to do so. So having a copy I cut it out and
                    enclose it. You will see it makes some outrageously false statements about you
                    at which your friends were naturally indignant, but I am surprised that William
                    was green enough to suppose that he could get any reply printed in that organ of
                    the Philistines; and he probably made it so severe as to preclude its
                    publication <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00293.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fyal.00293.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00293.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">yal.00293.002_large.jpg</span>
                    any way even supposing them to
                    have been suddenly smitten with a conscience. A very improbable
                    supposition.—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">You have heard that I have finally received the "grand bounce" from an ungrateful
                    government. The fact is I have been rather badly treated by an uncircumsized dog
                    from Kentucky, but such a thing was bound to happen sooner or later, and better
                    now than later.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I am still in the prime of life, have health, some means and many friends, and if
                    under these circumstances I did not cheerfully accept the situation I should be
                    unworthy ever to have read Leaves of Grass, with its philosophy of hope and the
                    morning.—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I enclose you my professional card. If
                    after a fair trial I do not succeed in earning a living <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00293.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fyal.00293.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00293.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">yal.00293.003_large.jpg</span> in this way I shall probably
                    drift back into my old trade of Publishing.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I hope you are as comfortable as usual, and enjoying as much of life as you
                    describe in some of the later notes in Specimen Days.—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I should be delighted to hear from you, and believe me ever</p>
