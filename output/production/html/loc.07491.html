            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special or new with me—Still stagger under the bad cold in the head,
                indigestion &amp;c—was out driving yesterday afternoon—beautiful
                spring—enjoyed it much—rec'd a note f'm Mr Smith
                to-day that he had been ill &amp; confined for a month, mostly a badly inflamed eye,
                a pretty serious case—suffering badly—but is getting over it. Mrs. S has sailed for England—Donnelly's book I see is out—a case of "great cry &amp; little wool" I opine—</p>
