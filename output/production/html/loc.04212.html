                <span class="tei_salute">My Dearest Friend:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">You could not easily realize the strong emotion with which I read your last note and traced on the little map<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—a most precious possession which I would not part with for the whole world—all your journeyings—both in youth &amp; now. Mingled emotions! for I cannot but feel anxious about your health, &amp; if I didn't know it was very naught to ask you questions, should beg you [to] tell me in what way your health has failed—whether it is the rheumatic &amp; neuralgic affection that troubled you the last spring we were in Philadelphia, or whether the fatigues &amp; excitements &amp; the very enjoyments &amp; full life, &amp; burst of prophetic joy, as it were, had proved too great a strain. But you have accomplished another thing, that had to be done in your life &amp; I exult with you—have seen the vast magnificent theatre, the free, unfettered conditions whereon humanity will enact a new drama, with the parts all so differently cast! the rest—the moving spirit of it all—hints of this, at least—flashes, glimpses, I find in your greatest poems. But, dear Friend, I think humanity moves forward [slowly] even under splendid conditions—you must give it a century or two instead of 50 years—before at least the crowning glories of a corresponding literature &amp; art will develope themselves—Nature has got plenty of time before her, &amp; obstinately refuses to be hurried; witness her dealings with the mere rocks &amp; stones.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Bee<a href="#n0260" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0260">3</a> is at Berne, working away merrily, rejoicing in the really splendid advantage for medical study there open to her. She mastered German so as to be able to speak &amp; understand it—lectures &amp; all—with ease during the two months at Wiesbaden &amp; she has found a thoroughly comfortable home with some excellent, intelligent ladies who are fond of her &amp; see to her bodily welfare in every possible way. I have my dear little grandson with me here—as engaging a little toddler as the sun ever shone upon—so affectionate &amp; sweet-tempered &amp; bright. I wish I could see him sitting on your knee. You will certainly have to come to us as soon as ever we have a comfortable home, won't you? Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">4</a> is well &amp; as rosy as ever. She &amp; Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">5</a> send their love. I have seen Rossetti<a href="#n0522" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0522">6</a>—he was full of enquiries &amp; affectionate interest in all that concerns you—&amp; loth we were to break off our conversation &amp; hurry back—but Hampstead, the pleasantest &amp; prettiest of all our suburbs, is terribly inaccessible &amp; cuts us off a good deal from the intercourse with old friends I had looked forward to. It is on the top of a high hill (as high as the top of St. Pauls), &amp; looks down on one side over the great city with its canopy of smoke, &amp; on the other over a wide, pleasant stretch of green &amp; fertile Middlesex—has moreover pleasant lanes, solid old houses, shaded by big elms, &amp; other picturesque features &amp; such an abundance of keen, fresh air this cold weather too! We sigh for the warmth of an American house indoors often &amp; for American sunshine out of doors. Rossetti has a beautiful little group of children growing up around him—I think the eldest girl will grow up a real beauty &amp; the boy too is a noble little fellow. I meet numbers so delighted to hear about you. I believe Addington Symonds<a href="#n0615" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0615">7</a> is preparing a book which treats largely of your Poems.</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">Glad to hear that Brother &amp; Sister &amp; nieces are all well. I wish I could write to some of them, but what with needlework, an avalanche of letters, the care of my dear little man—the re-editing of my husband's life of Blake,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">8</a> to which there will be a considerable addition of letters newly come to light, I hardly know which way to turn. Per.<a href="#n2000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2000">9</a> &amp; my nephew &amp; the "Process" have made a great stride forward. Won two important law suits at Berlin, where the Bessemer ring &amp; Krupp at their head were trying to oust them of their patent rights. Also it is practically making good way in England. So by &amp; bye the money will begin to flow in, I suppose—but has not done so yet.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I trust, dearest Friend, this will find you safe &amp; fairly well again at Camden, with plenty of great, happy thoughts to brood over for the winter.</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love from us all. Good-bye.</span>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
