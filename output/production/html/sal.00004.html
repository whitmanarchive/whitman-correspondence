                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
                    Miller (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.31.html"> Tuesday, August 14, 1888</a>). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    (1851–1903) was a well-known celebrity photographer who had taken
                    photographs of Whitman when the poet was in New York to give his lecture on Abraham Lincoln (his Lincoln lecture)
                    in April 1887. "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/zzz.00105.html">The Laughing

                    Cox (1851–1903) proposed selling signed copies of his photographs of
                    Whitman. However, when the September 1887 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> appeared with an advertisement, Whitman still had not seen
                    proofs, much less signed the photographs. The disagreement Whitman describes
                    here was quickly resolved, and he signed photographs for Cox and returned them.
                    Cox had taken multiple photographs of Whitman in April, 1887, including the
                    image known as "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image103.html?sort=year&amp;order=descending&amp;page=3">The Laughing Philosopher</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n0264">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0264 note" id="n0264"><span>Jeannette Leonard Gilder (1849–1916) helped

                    was needlessly concerned about the sale of his photographs with a forged
                    signature. On September 3 he noted: "Johnston went to see Cox,
                    photographer—J thinks 'it is all right.' "Although Johnston wrote on <a href="loc.02571">September 10</a> about a suspected forgery (Whitman's

                    financial arrangements (see the letter from Whitman to Johnston of <a href="yal.00251">September 29 1887</a>), forwarded from Cox to Whitman
