            <p class="tei_p">Still here in my big chair in the sick room yet—a coolish wave to-day, but
                pleasant enough—John Burroughs has been to see me, the good hearty
                affectionate nature-scented fellow, very welcome—he left yesterday en route to visit Johnson (Century staff) at Sea Girt, on
                the N J sea coast—J B lodged at Tom Harned's, &amp; T H and Horace liked him
                muchly—J B is not so hardy &amp; brown &amp; stout as formerly—that bad
                fiend insomnia haunts him as of old—he thinks himself it affects his literary
                power, (style, even matter)—Horace told him my half-suspicion that his
                association with the superciliousness &amp; sort o' vitriolic veneering of the New
                York literati had eat into him, but he denied &amp; pooh-pooh'd it—attributed
                it to his bad health, insomnia &amp;c—said he knew himself he could not (or 
                did not) write with the vim of his better days—(probably makes more acc't of
                that by far, than really <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">is</span>)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I expect to get a specimen copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> from the
                binder this evening—Shall not feel out of the woods &amp; all safe, until I
                see the October <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>, with my Army Hospital piece
                printed—accepted &amp; paid for by them two years ago—as I consider
                myself obligated not to print from it until it has been <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">first</span>
                published by them—(But I have heard they give it—intend to—in the
                Oct. number)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-09-22"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Afternoon</span></span>—Horace comes with spec[imen] of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: B</span> bound for sample—it is satisfactory—looks
                plain, larger than expected—I give an order or two changing the lettering on
                cover, &amp;c.—the picture printing gives satisfaction—In fact <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all will do</span>—("Only think" said the Irish girl "what
                ye'd said if it was ever so worser")—I have been expecting Alma Johnston of N
                Y to-day (or yesterday)—but no sign—a dear &amp; prized
                friend—"good roots" for the meter (slang from N Y
                vagabonds, for favorable prophecy)—It gets cooler &amp; I have donn'd my big
                blue wool overgown—as I end with love &amp; thanks to you—</p>
