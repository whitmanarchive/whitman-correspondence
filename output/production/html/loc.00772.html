               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got a long letter from George, dated near Lancaster, Kentucky, May 15th<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—he seems to be well &amp; in good spirits, says he gets some letters from me &amp; papers too—At the time he wrote, the 51st was doing provost duty at Lancaster, but would not probably remain so very long—seem to be moving toward southeast Kentucky—had a good camp, &amp; good times generally. LeGendre<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is colonel—Gen. Ferrero<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> has left the service—Col. Potter<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> (now Brig. Gen.) is in Cincinnati—Capt. Sims<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> &amp;c are all well—George describes Kentucky as a very fine country—says the people are about half &amp; half, secesh &amp; union. This is the longest letter I have yet rec'd from George. Did he write you one about the same time? Mother, I have not rec'd any word from home in over a week—the last letter I had from Mr. Lane was about 12 days ago, sending me $10 for the soldiers, (5 from Mr. Kirkwood<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> &amp; 5 from Conklin Brush.)<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I should like to hear from Martha, I wish Jeff would write me about it<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>—has Andrew gone? &amp; how is your wrist &amp; arm, mother—We have had some very hot weather here—I don't know what I should have done without the thin grey coat you sent—you don't know how good it does, &amp; looks too—I wore it three days, &amp; carried a fan &amp; an umbrella, (quite a Japanee)—most every body here carries an umbrella, on acc't of the sun—yesterday &amp; to-day however have been quite cool, east wind—Mother, the shirts were a real godsend, they do first rate, I like the fancy Marseilles collar &amp; wristbands—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, how are you getting along—I suppose just the same as ever—I suppose Jess &amp; Ed are just the same as ever—when you write, you tell me all about every thing, &amp; the Browns,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> &amp; the neighborhood generally. Mother, is George's trunk home &amp; of no use, there? I wish I had it here, as I must have a trunk—but do not wish you to send it, until I send you word—I suppose my letter never appeared in the Eagle,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> well I shall send them no more, as I think likely they hate to put in any thing which may celebrate me a little, even though it is just the thing they want for their paper &amp; readers. They altered the other letter on that account, very meanly. I shall probably have letters in the N. Y. Times &amp; perhaps other papers in about a week<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a>—Mother, I have been pretty active in hospitals for the past two weeks, somewhere every day or night—I have written you so much about cases &amp;c I will not write you any more, on that subject this time—O the sad, sad things I see, the noble young men with legs &amp; arms taken off—the deaths—the sick weakness, sicker than death, that some endure, after amputations—(there is a great difference, some make little of it, others lie after it for days, just flickering alive, &amp; O so deathly weak &amp; sick)—I go this afternoon to Campbell Hospital, out a couple of miles.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I should like to have Jeff send me 20 of the large sized portraits &amp; as many of the standing figure, do them up flat. I think every day about Martha. Mother, have you heard any further about Han? Good bye for the present, dearest mother.</p>

                    George's regiment. From March 16 through March 18, 1862, George described
                    Potter's bravery in the battle at New Bern, North Carolina: "I went up to him
                    and asked him if he was struck, he said only with a spent ball that did not hurt
                    him mutch, and he got up and went into the thickest of it again and did not give
                    up untill the fighting was over which was an hour after I spoke to him, when he
                    found a ball had struck him just above the hip and passed through his side"
