        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Son,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here in my room, having just eat a hearty dinner with my mammy, (who has this
        month entered on her 76th year, but to my eyes looks young &amp;
        handsome yet.) It is a dark &amp; cloudy day, &amp; the rain is just now pouring down in
        torrents. It is a great disappointment to many, as Farragut's funeral celebration was to come off to–day, &amp; all the military, &amp;
        Departments here, &amp; hundreds of societies, orders, schools &amp;c. had prepared to turn
        out—&amp; most of them did turn out, this forenoon, only to get soaked with rain,
        &amp; covered with mud—I saw one crack battalion, all so spruce &amp; handsome, with
        white pants, &amp; silver gray coats, &amp; every thing so bright &amp; trim when they
        marched down—&amp; an hour &amp; a half afterwards, they looked like draggled roosters
        that had been pumped on—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We have had weeks and weeks of the very finest weather up to early this morning, &amp; now
        it is the worst kind to be out in. Still we want rain so very much, one dont feel to complain. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pete, I rec'd your last letter, the 26th—it was a good long, lively letter, &amp;
        welcome—you write about the Signal Corps—Allen deserves credit for persevering &amp; studying—&amp; I hope
        he will do well—&amp; think he will too—for he is sober, &amp; tries to get
        ahead—any how he is a young man I like—Thornett is a
        very intelligent manly fellow, cute, plucky, &amp;c—he has one fault, &amp; a bad
        one—that is he will drink, &amp; spree it—which spoils all—True it is none
        of my business, but I feel that it would be perhaps the making of him, if he would give it
        up, &amp; find his pleasure in some other way—Pete, should you see Allen again, give
        him my love—&amp; the same for Thornett also—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Did you mean for me to write what I think of your joining the Signal Corps? But are you
        proficient enough in studies? I heartily advise you to peg away at the arithmetic—do
        something at it every day—arithmetic is the foundation of all such things—(just
        as a good stone wall is the foundation for a house)—become a good arithmetician first
        of all—&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you surely will, if you keep pegging away a little
          every day</span>—how much leisure you have after all, that might be used for
        study—I don't mean all your leisure, but say one hour out of every three—then
        keep looking over the geography—when I come back I will bring a little pocket
        dictionary—with 15 minutes writing every day, &amp; correcting by the dictionary I
        would warrant you becoming a correct speller &amp; real handsome writer in a year or
        less—&amp; when one is a fair arithmetician &amp; spells &amp; writes finely, so many
        things are open to him. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">As things stand at present I expect to be back by or before next Sunday.
      </p>
