                    sent a "postal to Dr Bucke ab't Longfellow's autograph," which Bucke had
                    apparently requested (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
                    of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                    D.C.). On <a href="nyp.00509">February 22</a>, Longfellow wrote to
                    Whitman: "It gives me great pleasure to comply with your request"; and on
                    February 24, Whitman sent the autograph to Bucke (Whitman's Commonplace Book).
                    In 1891, Whitman recollected the incident in a conversation with Horace Traubel:
                    "Bucke once got me in a hell of a hole. Wrote asking me to interpose for an
                    autograph of Longfellow—wished it for some great lord somebody up
                    there—a man he was under—a man whose favor he particularly
                    wanted—indeed, he owned as much to me—and would have me write, which
                    I did. And the gentle amiable sweet Longfellow acquiesced. But I was ashamed of
                    myself—thousands of dollars would not have bought it. This thing with
                    Forman [another request for an autograph] amounts to about the same. I do it but
                    hate myself for surrendering" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 8:223–224). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
