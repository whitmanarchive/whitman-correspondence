                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Before any more days pass I must write and tell thee of our visit to Tennyson,<a href="#n0625" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0625">1</a> which took place day before yesterday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We sent him thy letter from Lord Mount Temple's, where we were staying. His son
                Hallam wrote to us from the Isle of Wight, asking us to come Wednesday morning. So,
                Wednesday, about half past eleven, papa and Alys and I alighted at his front door,
                where a huge, curly dog overwhelmed us with caresses. Tennyson was not in, but Lady
                    Tennyson<a href="#n0903" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0903">2</a> received us and talked with us until he came. We
                were walking in the old-fashioned flower garden when we met him, and almost the
                first thing he said was a "deep remark." He said that he was walking out one evening
                looking at the stars, so absorbed that he fell into a puddle; but he noticed
                afterward that the star was in the puddle also! Thereupon we all tried to think of
                something witty in reply. Something about poet's feet tangled among stars would have
                been appropriate, but as none of us thought of that reply till afterward, we had to
                let the opportunity slip. We walked with him and with his son all about the garden
                for about an hour. He showed us a tree planted by Gambetta,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> and talked to me about Turgeineff,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> and asked all about thee.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As we were going away, he told me to give thee his love. His home is a large,
                rambling, old-fashioned house full of interesting pictures and engravings. It has a
                look of being lived in, and all the arrangements were "casual," as English people
                say. Hats and walking-sticks were lying about in chairs and dogs raced in and out at
                their pleasure.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Tennyson's "den" is up at the top of a narrow, winding stair—a large, sunny room,
                lined with books and having a lovely view of Freshwater Bay, framed in the dark
                green branches of the cedars of Lebanon. They insisted upon our staying to lunch,
                but made us promise not to put anything in any newspaper about it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tennyson seems to have a horror of notoriety, and he told us a great many stories of
                the annoyances to which he had been subjected from curious, inquisitive, and
                gossiping visitors.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The chief impression that his conversation made upon me was of a keen and eager mind
                (he has a wonderful memory for facts) and a keen sense of humor. He tells a funny
                story as well as anyone I ever heard. We came away soon after lunch, having had a
                most interesting visit, for which we all felt very grateful to thee..., Alys<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">5</a> looks forward to going to see thee when she comes home
                in September, and to showing thee the photograph of himself which Tennyson gave her,
                with his autograph beneath.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">With much love, I am, thy friend,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Mary Whitall Smith</span>

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n0903">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0903 note" id="n0903"><span>Emily Sarah Tennyson
