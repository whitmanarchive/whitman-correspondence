                    and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller accepted
                    Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:

                    because it is consistent with a December rumor that William Strong would be
                    appointed to the office of attorney general. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00587_n4 note" id="duk.00587_n4"><span>The word may be "easy"

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
                    George, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00587_n9 note" id="duk.00587_n9"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    probably refers to a brief article that identifies William Strong as President
                    Ulysses S. Grant's potential appointment to office of attorney general ("The
                    News," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, December 18, 1869, 2).
                    Louisa's interest is that Walt Whitman served as a clerk in the office of the
                    attorney general. William Strong (1808–1895) was never nominated to office
                    of attorney general, but Grant eventually nominated him to the Supreme Court, in
                    which he served as a justice from 1871 to 1880 (Lisabeth G. Svendsgaard,
                    "Strong, William," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American National Biography Online</span>).
                    Ebenezer R. Hoar (1816–1895) remained in the office until his resignation
                    on June 23, 1870. Amos T. Ackerman (1821–1880) replaced Hoar (see Mark

                    considered Walt Whitman a regular contributor, printing several of his poems,

                    (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864.
                    After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a
                    lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving
                    or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John
                    Burroughs in 1857 and also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on

                    (1832–1889) was one of Walt Whitman's staunchest defenders, and Walt was
                    also close with William's wife Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor. Whitman dined with the
                    O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he wrote often in his
                    letters of their daughter Jean "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William
                    O'Connor would break in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to
                    emancipated black citizens, Ellen remained friendly with Whitman. For more on
