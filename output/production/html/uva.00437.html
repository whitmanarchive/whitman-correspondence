            <p class="tei_p">I keep on fairly in health &amp; strength—have been out here a few days the
                guest of Mr &amp; Mrs F B Sanborn—&amp; everything most affectionate &amp; hospitable from
                them both—&amp; from others—Have had a curiously full and satisfactory
                time with Emerson—he came to see me Saturday evening early, Mrs E also, &amp; staid two hours—Yesterday I went there (by pressing invitation) to dinner,
                &amp; staid two hours—a wonderfully good two hours—the whole family were
                very cordial, including Mrs. E. &amp; the son, Edward, a doctor, a fine, handsome,
                'cute, glowing young man, with a beautiful wife and child—I took to them
                all—I cannot tell you how sweet and good (and all as it should be) Emerson look'd and behaved—he did not talk, in the way of joining in any animated
                conversation, but pleasantly and hesitatingly &amp; sparsely—fully
                enough—to me it seemed just as it should be—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The book is about through—will appear last of October—every thing
                satisfactory—I go from here in about a week to Johnston's, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="correspondence​ ">cor:</span>​  Mott avenue &amp; 149th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Street​ ">St.</span>​
