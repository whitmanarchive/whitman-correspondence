            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been absent in New York &amp; Brooklyn &amp; only returned three days ago. 
                I have rec'd your note, &amp; wish to answer it elaborately soon. At present, 
                I can only say that if you are going into publishing &amp; if you feel like taking hold of my productions, 
                I should cordially open negotiations with you—But the papers are in error in giving the idea that 
                I am writing a book on a new subject—it is only a new &amp; far more perfected edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—which work, though printed, has really never been <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">published</span> at all. 
                I shall be happy to hear any thing from you. My address is at this office.
            </p>

                        2, 1865</a> letter to Peter Eckler), wrote on <a href="loc.01924">May
                        10, 1867</a>, that he was going into business for himself: "Hearing you
                    are writing another book, [I] would like to print and publish it for you and
                    will give you better advantages than any other publishing house.…One of my
                    reasons for securing your friendship is my appreciation for you as a man, with
                    knowing your life has been devoted to help among those most in need of your
                    assistance." In his <a href="loc.01925">May 31, 1867</a> letter, he
                    informed Walt Whitman that "we have established a Ptg &amp; Publishing House."
                    But, on <a href="loc.01926">July 3, 1867</a>, he advised Walt Whitman that
                    after consultation "with several eminent literary men,…though we are
                    favorably impressed,…we deem it injudicious to commit ourselves to its
                    publication at the present time." (These letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.) </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
