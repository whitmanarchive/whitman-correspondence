            <p class="tei_p">I have been absent in New York &amp; Brooklyn &amp; only returned three days ago. 
                I have rec'd your note, &amp; wish to answer it elaborately soon. At present, 
                I can only say that if you are going into publishing &amp; if you feel like taking hold of my productions, 
                I should cordially open negotiations with you—But the papers are in error in giving the idea that 
                I am writing a book on a new subject—it is only a new &amp; far more perfected edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—which work, though printed, has really never been <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">published</span> at all. 
                I shall be happy to hear any thing from you. My address is at this office.
            </p>
