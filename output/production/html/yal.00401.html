                    wood engraver, came to the U.S. in 1866 and settled near New Haven, Conn. He
                    illustrated the works of Whittier, Longfellow, Bryant, and others, wrote the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in America</span> (1882), and edited
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poetry of America, 1776–1876</span> (London, 1878), in
                    which appeared eight of Walt Whitman's poems as well as his picture. According
                    to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
                        1890—Recollections</span> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Walt
                    Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in
                    his <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a> letter to Peter Doyle): "I
                    liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
                    who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
