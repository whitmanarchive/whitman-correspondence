            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Weekly Tribune</span> of 21st prints the Harvest Carol on its last page, but leaves out several connecting verses indispensable to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ensemble</span> of the piece, &amp; mangling it pretty badly in several ways. This is rather too much of a liberty. Would it be worth while to attempt a correction—asking the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> folk to insert in their columns an item like the enclosed slip—for instance?—As presented by them, the Carol is very much like one of those toy caoutchouc faces, with the mouth &amp; nose utterly squeezed out—They ought by good rights to print it again in full, from the correct version in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>—but I suppose that could not be done.</p>
