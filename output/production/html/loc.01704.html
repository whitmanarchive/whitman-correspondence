            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Weekly Tribune</span> of 21st prints the Harvest Carol on its last page, but leaves out several connecting verses indispensable to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ensemble</span> of the piece, &amp; mangling it pretty badly in several ways. This is rather too much of a liberty. Would it be worth while to attempt a correction—asking the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> folk to insert in their columns an item like the enclosed slip—for instance?—As presented by them, the Carol is very much like one of those toy caoutchouc faces, with the mouth &amp; nose utterly squeezed out—They ought by good rights to print it again in full, from the correct version in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>—but I suppose that could not be done.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>

                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
                    York newspapers until he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army and Navy
                        Journal</span> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
                    he established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866. Financial control of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William
                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
                    Francis wrote for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> the unsigned piece
                    "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the

                    printed this letter, explains the situation clearly. "A Carol of Harvest, for
                    1867," which was to appear in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in September
                    1867, was printed in abbreviated form in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Weekly
                        Tribune</span> on August 21, 1867; sections five to ten and half of section
                    eleven were omitted. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Weekly Tribune</span> observed on
                    August 28, 1867: "Some of Mr. Walt Whitman's friends complain of us for
                    publishing only a part of his Harvest Carol in the last number of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Weekly Tribune</span>. We did not print the whole, first
                    because it was too long, and secondly because it was not good enough. Anybody
                    who wants the rest will find it in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>." The poem
                    was later retitled "The Return of the Heroes." See also Whitman's <a href="prc.00009">August 7</a>, <a href="prc.00010">August 11</a>,
