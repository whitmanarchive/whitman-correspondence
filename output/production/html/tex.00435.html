            <p class="tei_p">Pete, do you remember—(of course you do—I do well)—those great long jovial walks we had at times for years, (1866–<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="1872​ ">'72</span>​ ) out of Washington City—often moonlight nights—'way to "Good Hope";—or, Sundays, up and down the Potomac shores, one side or the other, sometimes ten miles at a stretch? Or when you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="worked​ ">work'd</span>​  on the horse-cars, and I waited for you, coming home late together—or resting and chatting at the Market, corner 7th Street and the Avenue, and eating those nice musk or watermelons? Or during my tedious sickness and first paralysis (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="1873​ ">'73</span>​ ) how you used to come to my solitary garret-room and make up my bed, and enliven me, and chat for an hour or so—or perhaps go out and get the medicines Dr. Drinkard had <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="ordered​ ">order'd</span>​  for me—before you went on duty?</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete, give my love to dear Mrs. and Mr. Nash, and tell them I have not forgotten them, and never will.</p>
