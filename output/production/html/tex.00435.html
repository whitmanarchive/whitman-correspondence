            <p class="tei_p">Pete, do you remember<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—(of course you do—I do well)—those great long jovial walks we had at times for years, (1866–<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="1872​ ">'72</span>​ ) out of Washington City—often moonlight nights—'way to "Good Hope";—or, Sundays, up and down the Potomac shores, one side or the other, sometimes ten miles at a stretch? Or when you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="worked​ ">work'd</span>​  on the horse-cars, and I waited for you, coming home late together—or resting and chatting at the Market, corner 7th Street and the Avenue, and eating those nice musk or watermelons? Or during my tedious sickness and first paralysis (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="1873​ ">'73</span>​ ) how you used to come to my solitary garret-room and make up my bed, and enliven me, and chat for an hour or so—or perhaps go out and get the medicines Dr. Drinkard had <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="ordered​ ">order'd</span>​  for me—before you went on duty?</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete, give my love to dear Mrs. and Mr. Nash,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> and tell them I have not forgotten them, and never will.</p>

                    the fly-leaf of a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>, sent to Peter
                    Doyle at Washington, D.C., in June, 1883. It was published subsequently in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days &amp; Collect</span> as "Note to a Friend" (see
                        <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span></a>, 443). The note is
                    significant, because it constitutes the first correspondence from Whitman to
                    Doyle since July 1880. It appears that writing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                        Days</span> stirred Whitman's memories of the times he shared with Doyle in
                    Washington, contributing to the nostalgic air of this note. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_tex.00435_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_genoways tei_note_type_editorial note" id="tex.00435_n2"><span>Mr. and Mrs. Michael
