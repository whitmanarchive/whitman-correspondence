                <span class="tei_salute">Byron Sutherland, <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>Dear young man,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter of September 12, &amp; was well pleased to hear from you. 
                I have many times thought of you—for I must tell you, Byron, 
                I retain just the same friendship I formed for you the short time we were together, (but intimate,) in 1865.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I think, at that time, I was a clerk in the Interior Department. 
                I was dismissed from there—but was appointed by the then Attorney General, 
                Mr. Speed, to a moderate place in his Dep't. I have been in that Dep't. ever since—have a pleasant situation—have been promoted—&amp; have now served under four successive Attorney Generals.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is rather dull in Washington—but I make out quite comfortably—walk &amp; ride around a good deal. Byron, I am still living in the same house, 
                472 M street, near 12th, where you staid with me a little while in 1865—and where you would be truly welcome to your old friend if you would come &amp; stop with him again.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing very new or special with me. I have excellent health, 
                eat my rations every time, and am I suppose full as fat and brown and bearded &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sassy</span> as ever.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I will send you, by same mail with this, a newspaper, with a piece written by 
                a young man, Col. Hinton, a friend of mine, some time since, about me, 
                that may interest you—but he plasters it on pretty thick.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As you see by the heading of this letter I am now in New York. 
                Your letter was sent on to me here. I am on furlough, which expires last of October, 
                when I shall return to Washington. While here I spend much of my time with 
                my dear Mother, in Brooklyn—she is hearty &amp; cheerful, though nearly 73.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My address, for some four weeks to come, will be as at the heading 
                of this letter. After that, at Washington, D. C.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I believe that is all, this time. Byron, I send you my love &amp; friendship, 
                dear soldier boy—and now that we have found each other again, let us try, 
                as far as may be, to keep together.
            </p>
