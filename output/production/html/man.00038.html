                    (1815–1900) was a suffragist and abolitionist who later founded the
                    Detroit Women's Club. She married Augustus Wright Leggett (1836–1855), and
                    the couple's home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Leggett, who was also
                    the grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
                    from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in
                    Thomas Donaldson's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: The Man</span> (New York:

                    were father and son, both artists. In a notation late in 1880 Whitman referred
                    to Percy, "age 16, a student, intends to be an artist . . . Academy of Fine
                    Arts" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
                    of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On
                    December 21, 1881, Percy made several pencil sketches of Whitman, and in his
                    letter to his grandmother, Elisa S. Leggett, on December 25, he drew a sketch
                    for her of the picture which was "in a promising condition" (Detroit Public
                    Library). His oil painting of Whitman is now in the Feinberg Collection. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
