            <p class="tei_p">I am back here in New York, stopping for a couple of days at this hotel—as Dr Bucke &amp; his sister are here (she is in poor health, &amp; they are here to
                consult a special physician)—we wanted to be together till Monday or Tuesday,
                when they start back for Canada—Then I shall go up &amp; stay with Mr &amp;

                fortnight—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I came on yesterday from Boston—As I told you in my
                last every thing went on there satisfactory—&amp;
                my treatment from Osgood has been of the best—the prospect for the book (sales
                &amp;c) seems to be fair—there are already quite a number of orders—it
                is all ready, &amp; will be delivered &amp; for sale 4<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span> <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Nov.</span>​ —There will come
                a box (or bundle) by express to me probably to-day or to-morrow from Osgood,
                contains some of the books—Lou dear you open &amp; take one out for yourself,
                as I suppose you would like to see how it looks—leave the bundle tied up in
                the dark stout paper, as it contains only some MSS and stuff—also there may
                come a roll of printed matter for me, to be put up in my room—it will be
                directed to you "for W W"—(as any thing directed to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span>
                is liable to be forwarded here from Camden p o)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am well as usual—I shall stay here in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​  ten or twelve days &amp; then home
                for a while—Lou I expect to spend a good part of
                the winter up in London, as I quite like it, &amp; they have great plenty of room,
                grub, servants &amp; every thing—I am enjoying the day &amp; time (Sunday
                forenoon) here at this big hotel—&amp; it is a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rouser</span>,
                (as you will see by the picture)—Dr B. and the Sister have gone over to church
                to Brooklyn to hear Beecher—&amp; I have been
                &amp; am having a good nice time sitting here by myself reading the Sunday <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span>,
