                    editor in 1862. After serving as a war journalist during the Civil War, he moved
                    to New York in 1865 to work at the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>,
                    which he edited from 1866 to 1868. In 1870 he established his own newspaper, the

                    in 1879. Young's knowledge of the Chinese language earned him the position of

                    (1829–1905) was an American actor and one of the most famous American
                    comedians of the nineteenth century. He was well known for his portrayal of Rip
                    Van Winkle onstage. On <a href="loc.04889">October 23, 1891</a>, the
                    American journalist and diplomat John Russell Young (1840–1899) invited
                    Whitman to an informal luncheon at the Union Club in Philadelphia in honor of
                    Joseph Jefferson and William Jermyn Florence, stage name of Bernard Conlin, a
                    dialect comedian. Whitman declined the invitation, according to his <a href="loc.07893">October 24, 1891</a>, letter to the Canadian physician

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
