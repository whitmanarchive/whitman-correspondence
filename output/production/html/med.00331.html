               <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My dear Walt</span>: I spent much time yesterday reading your poems, and am more charmed with them than ever. I think you would have done well to follow Mr. Emerson's advice, but you may have done better as it is. At any rate, the book is bound to sell, if money enough is spent circulating the Reprints and advertising it generally. It is a fundamental principle in political economy that everything succeeds if money enough is spent on it. If I could spend five hundred dollars in one week on the Saturday Press I would make five thousand dollars by the operation. Ditto you with the L. of G.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">You should send copies at once to Vanity Fair, Momus, The Albion, The Day Book, The Journal of Commerce, Crayon—also to Mrs. Juliette H. Beach, Albion, N.Y.,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a> who will do you great justice in the S.P. (for we shall have a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">series</span> of articles)—to Charles D. Gardette Esq,<a href="#n101" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r101">2</a> No 910 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, to Evening Journal, Philadelphia, and also some dozen copies to me to be distributed at discretion. Do not hereafter ask the editors to notice at any particular time or at all: for the effect is bad.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I want to do great things for you with the book, and as soon as I get over my immediate troubles will do so. But just now I am in a state of despair even in respect to getting out another issue of the S.P. and all for want of a paltry two or three hundred dollars which would take the thing to a paying point, and make it worth ten thousand dollars as a transferable piece of property.</p>

                    was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp most likely met in
                    Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan. Clapp, who founded the
                    literary weekly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span> in 1858, was
                    instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over twenty items on
                    Whitman appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> before the periodical
                    folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace Traubel, "You
                    will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know all about me."
                    For more about Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in

                    Beach," but it had really been written by her husband, Calvin Beach. Expecting a
                    favorable response, the editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>,
                    Henry Clapp, Jr., had forwarded a copy of Whitman's book to Juliette Beach for
                    review. Her husband, however, angered that Clapp had sent the book to his wife,
                    appropriated it and wrote a scathing review, which was published in his wife's
                    name. In a letter to Clapp dated June 7, 1860, Juliette Beach explained the
                    nature of the mistake and expressed her regret at not having had the opportunity
                    to publish her own favorable opinion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.
                    In an attempt to undo some of the damage, Clapp printed a notice titled
                    "Correction" in the subsequent issue of his newspaper, alongside three positive
                    commentaries on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> by women. (For Calvin
                    Beach's review of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00039.html">Leaves of Grass</a>.") Ellen O'Connor contributed her bit to the theory
                    that Beach and Walt Whitman had a love affair when she asserted that "Out of the
                    Rolling Ocean, the Crowd," published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, was
                    composed for "a certain lady" who had angered her husband because of her
                    correspondence with the poet (Emory Holloway, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</span>, [Garden City, New York:
                    Doubleday, Page and Company, 1921], 1:lviii). "Mrs. Beach's notes" may be the
                    letters to Walt Whitman, which later Burroughs vainly asked Mrs. Beach to print;
                    see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life and Letters of John Burroughs</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1925), 1:120. If these were love letters,
                    Walt Whitman hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings discreetly. See also

                    was a former reporter for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Evening Post</span> who
                    now wrote for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Evening Journal</span> and also
                    contributed frequently to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>—and
                    whenever in New York joined Clapp, Whitman, and the others at the Bohemian table
                    at Pfaff's. An accomplished parodist, Gardette achieved his greatest fame when
                    challenged by his friends to create a perfect imitation of Poe. His homage,
                    published in the November 19, 1859, issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday
                        Press</span>, was so convincing that it continued to surface in volumes of
                    Poe's collected works into the twentieth century, even after Gardette published
                    detailed accounts of its composition. Under the pen-name "Saerasmid" (an anagram
                    of "Desmarais"), Gardette published several parodies of Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span> in 1860: "Yourn and Mine, and Any-Day (A
                    Yawp, After Walt Whitman)" (January 21), "Poemet—(After Walt Whitman)"
                    (February 11), and "Saerasmid to Walt Whitman, A Greeting" (June 16). See George
