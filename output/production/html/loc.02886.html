                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    (Herbert, Beatrice, and Grace) from England to Philadelphia. The family lived in
                    Philadelphia from 1876 to 1878; Whitman visited their home almost daily and even
                    had his own room. From April 1878, to 1879, the Gilchrists lived in Concord,
                    Boston, and New York, before returning to England. Anne's son Herbert
                    (1857–1914) remained in America and lived in Philadelphia, maintaining a
                    close relationship with Whitman; after Whitman's death in 1892, he returned to
