               <span class="tei_salute">My dear sir,</span>
            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I have been much interested in a letter from you to Mr. Redpath, written some weeks ago, which I have lately seen, &amp; I am very glad to send you the inclosed check to be used for the benefit of our noble "boys" in the hospitals, at your discretion.  I have seen much of the hospitals myself, &amp; I know how much good your friendly sympathy must do them, &amp; also that even a slight pecuniary aid is sometimes very acceptable to them in their forlorn condition.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Of the enclosed check, ten dollars of the amount is contributed by my sister, Mrs. G.W. Briggs of Salem, to whom I read your letter, &amp; ten dollars by my friend Edward Atkinson.  The balance I give to the boys with great pleasure, &amp; I will very gladly give more hereafter, when I hear from you of the receipt of this &amp; find that more is needed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As your letter is not of a very late date, I do not feel certain that your address may be the same as at the time you wrote.  Please inform me how this is, as I hope to be able to send you more from other friends.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you will continue in your good work, as I am sure from your letter, &amp; from what my friend, Mr. Emerson, says of his own acquaintance with you, that your visits must give great comfort to our poor suffering men.</p>
