            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter yesterday. Pete you must be quite steady at work, &amp; no time to spare. 
                Well, perhaps it is just as satisfactory, considering all things. The cold weather has just 
                kept on here, as before—cold enough all the time—and then a spell of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">damned bitter,

            <p class="tei_p">—I am middling well, go out some every day, but not much—Best thing is my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">eating</span> &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sleeping</span>—I fall back on them altogether—I sleep splendid, have a good bed, plenty of cover—get up

                is very cheerful, looks well in the face, &amp; does more work cooking &amp;c. than most young

            <p class="tei_p">—Well Pete I believe that is all, this time. Good bye, my darling son—So the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">new shirts</span> turn out 
                a success do they? I have a great mind to be jealous—Give my love to

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
