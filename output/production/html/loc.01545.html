            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter yesterday. Pete you must be quite steady at work, &amp; no time to spare. 
                Well, perhaps it is just as satisfactory, considering all things. The cold weather has just 
                kept on here, as before—cold enough all the time—and then a spell of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">damned bitter, 
                stinging cold</span>, every now and then extra—not one single mild, warm day since I have 
                been home—six weeks—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I am middling well, go out some every day, but not much—Best thing is my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">eating</span> &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sleeping</span>—I fall back on them altogether—I sleep splendid, have a good bed, plenty of cover—get up 
                pretty early though <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01545.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01545.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01545.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>&amp; make the fire, &amp; set things a going, before mother comes out—she 
                has had some bad times with rheumatism, &amp;c—one hand &amp; arm quite disabled—still she 
                is very cheerful, looks well in the face, &amp; does more work cooking &amp;c. than most young 
                women—We have grand breakfasts, buckwheat cakes, coffee, &amp;c. eggs, &amp;c—just wish you could 
                come in mornings &amp; partake—We two always breakfast together, &amp; it is first rate—So you 
                see I fall back on sleeping &amp; eating, (as I said)—Should be glad to see Parker Milburn—hope he will call to-day—I send you a paper by mail
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Well Pete I believe that is all, this time. Good bye, my darling son—So the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">new shirts</span> turn out 
                a success do they? I have a great mind to be jealous—Give my love to 
                Wash Milburn, Adrian Jones, &amp; all the RR boys.
