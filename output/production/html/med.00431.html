      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of the 20th (for committee) has reached me here. I accept with pleasure the
        invitation to deliver a poem to your college &amp; visitors next June. Without any thing
        very definite at this moment, my idea is of a poem, fitting in not <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">unappropriately​ </span><span class="tei_corr">inappropriately​
        
      </span></span> to such an occasion, the recital of which would not occupy more than 30 minutes.
        All the pay I would want would be enough to pay my expenses, transportation &amp;c.,
        probably between 30 and $40, certainly not more than the latter sum. Please acknowledge this
        &amp; please write me more particulars about your college, where it is, specialties, if any
        &amp;c. I am stopping here, not entirely well, but able to get around, recovering from an
        attack of paralysis of over a year ago. </p>
