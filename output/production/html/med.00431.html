      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of the 20th (for committee) has reached me here. I accept with pleasure the
        invitation to deliver a poem to your college &amp; visitors next June. Without any thing
        very definite at this moment, my idea is of a poem, fitting in not <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">unappropriately​ </span></span> to such an occasion, the recital of which would not occupy more than 30 minutes.
        All the pay I would want would be enough to pay my expenses, transportation &amp;c.,
        probably between 30 and $40, certainly not more than the latter sum. Please acknowledge this
        &amp; please write me more particulars about your college, where it is, specialties, if any
        &amp;c. I am stopping here, not entirely well, but able to get around, recovering from an
        attack of paralysis of over a year ago. </p>

                    deliver, on June 17, 1874, a poem before the Mathematician Society of Tufts
                    College, a society "of young men of the Col. desiring to become more proficient
                    in the art of speaking, writing and debate." Mann replied to Whitman's queries
                    on April 2, 1874 (Oscar Lion). Whitman composed "Song of the Universal" for the
                    occasion, but, unable to deliver the poem in person, sent it to Mann on June 11,
                    1874. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
