            <p class="tei_p">The book is all sweet and sane and immortal. When I get well (I am slowly mending) I
                am going to read it carefully and slowly—not, as now, with a weak and whirling
                head. I noticed on page 317 what seemed a plate breakage—NOTES LEFT

            <p class="tei_p">Apropos of corrections, I wish, if Bucke's book comes to a second edition, that you

                poor fellow's horrible death, he does not
                deserve such commemoration. Garfield was a bad fellow. I knew him well. He was one
                of the worst types of an intriguing politician—personally and politically
                base. His death has canonized him, although the glamor is fading. Any knowing
                politician, who will be confidential with you, will tell you that Dorsey's
                allegations are strictly true. Three or four of them, I myself <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> to be true. A second reason for suppressing the piece, or relegating

                hurt the book immensely, and my article is a reply in which I take Mr. White's hide
                off, and "hang the calf-skin on his recreant limbs." Although Rice welcomes
                both sides, the Shakespeare prejudice is so strong, that I am afraid of not getting
                a hearing, and I wanted to make things even by bringing a little influence to bear
