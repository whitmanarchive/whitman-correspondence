                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
                    see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    as the "big book," was published by the poet himself—in an arrangement
                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span>—in December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made
                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    be buried in Harleigh Cemetery, in Camden, New Jersey, in an elaborate granite
                    tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of Philadelphia built the tomb, at
                    a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs with money that
                    his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a summer cottage;
                    the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor, Thomas Harned.
