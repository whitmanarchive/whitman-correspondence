         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I received your kind and welcome letter of the 13th inst and I assure you I was very
            glad to hear from you again and to hear that you are in good health and hope you will
            escape from any more attacks of Neuralgia.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I wish if aggreeable to yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us, and
            perpetuate the friendship commenced in Armory Square Hospital. I think it will be of
            benefit to me morally and perhaps will not be of any detriment to you.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">A few days ago I picked up a paper through my Friend Hamilton containing an article
            regarding Walt Whitman the Poet which was the first intimation I had of your being an
            author. I will send you the paper if you wish. I would like very much to read your works
            for I have heard my Father speak a few days ago of your Leaves of Grass and says it is
            well suited to the American People. Father has been here visiting me for a few days but
            has gone away now. he borrowed Leaves of Grass, of a friend of his here several years
            ago I believe, I have never seen any of your works. The weather has been very Cold for
            the past week and this morning it commenced to snow and has not stopped <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01487_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01487_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01487_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.01487_large.jpg</span>yet at 4 P.M. and I
            think we are going to have some sleighing for Christmas. I hope our political troubles
            will soon cease and the country get settled but I can not endorse the policy of
            President Johnson for I do not believe it is right to place the rebels in office or to
            allow them to vote until they are thoroughly repentant.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I must draw my letter to a close for this time, and hope I shall hear from you soon
            again. I hope you will have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>

   <div class="editorial_notes"><hr/><p><em>Correspondent:</em><br/><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0810 note" id="n0810"><span>The friendship between Whitman
                        and Wilson, a former U. S. Civil War soldier, can be reconstructed from
                        Wilson's letters (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                        1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On <a href="loc.01997">July 18, 1869</a>, Wilson recalled his confinement
                        in Armory Square Hospital (as mentioned in Whitman's <a href="loc.00802">November 8–9, 1863</a>, letter to Lewis K. Brown), "when your
                        kind face &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won their
                        hearts. I never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp; I
                        got there. We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's
                        first letter, written on <a href="loc.00611">November 11, 1865</a>, he
                        began: "I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this
                        time but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be
                        forgotten by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on <a href="loc.00614">December 16, 1866</a>: "I wish if aggreeable to
                        yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us ... I think it will
                        be of benefit to me morally, and perhaps will not be of any detriment to
                        you." In this letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Whitman
                        was a poet. On <a href="loc.01987">January 27, 1867</a>, he informed
                        Whitman that he had been reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, but
                        complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago that I was married but did
                        not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was displeased with it"; he
                        concluded the letter: "I remain as ever your<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> Boy Friend<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> with
                        Love<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> Benton H. Wilson." Walt Whitman replied (lost), and sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span>, which Wilson acknowledged on <a href="loc.01988">February 3, 1867</a>. On <a href="loc.01989">April 7, 1867</a>, after he informed Whitman that his wife had gone
                        to the hospital for her first confinement (the child was to be named Walt
                        Whitman), Wilson complained: "I am poor and am proud of it but I hope to
                        rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am not happy for my
                        disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I love her dearly but
                        I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had ought to live alone, but
                        I had not ought to feel so." On <a href="loc.01990">April 21,
                        1867</a>, Wilson acknowledged Whitman's reply of <a href="loc.01562">April 12, 1867</a>: "I do not want you to misunderstand my motives in
                        writing to you of my Situation &amp; feelings as I did in my last letter or
                        else I shall have to be more guarded in my letters to you. I wrote so
                        because you wanted me to write how I was situated, and give you my mind
                        without reserve, and all that I want is your advice and Love, and I do not
                        consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish you to write to me just as
                        you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as freely as you wish and will be
                        satisfied." On <a href="loc.01991">September 15, 1867</a>, Wilson
                        wondered why Whitman had not replied. In his letter of <a href="loc.01998">December 19, 1869</a>, Wilson
                        reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still selling melodeons
                        and sewing machines. On <a href="loc.01999">May 15, 1870</a>, Wilson
                        informed Whitman of his father's death two weeks earlier and related that
                        his son "Little Walt . . . is quite a boy now . . . and gets into all kinds
                        of Mischief." Evidently Wilson wrote to the poet for the last time on <a href="nyp.00398">June 23, 1875</a>, when he wanted to know "what I
                        can do to contribute to your comfort and happiness." </span></span></p></div>
