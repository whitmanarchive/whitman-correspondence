         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I received your kind and welcome letter of the 13th inst and I assure you I was very
            glad to hear from you again and to hear that you are in good health and hope you will
            escape from any more attacks of Neuralgia.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I wish if aggreeable to yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us, and
            perpetuate the friendship commenced in Armory Square Hospital. I think it will be of
            benefit to me morally and perhaps will not be of any detriment to you.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">A few days ago I picked up a paper through my Friend Hamilton containing an article
            regarding Walt Whitman the Poet which was the first intimation I had of your being an
            author. I will send you the paper if you wish. I would like very much to read your works
            for I have heard my Father speak a few days ago of your Leaves of Grass and says it is
            well suited to the American People. Father has been here visiting me for a few days but
            has gone away now. he borrowed Leaves of Grass, of a friend of his here several years
            ago I believe, I have never seen any of your works. The weather has been very Cold for
            the past week and this morning it commenced to snow and has not stopped <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01487_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01487_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01487_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>yet at 4 P.M. and I
            think we are going to have some sleighing for Christmas. I hope our political troubles
            will soon cease and the country get settled but I can not endorse the policy of
            President Johnson for I do not believe it is right to place the rebels in office or to
            allow them to vote until they are thoroughly repentant.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I must draw my letter to a close for this time, and hope I shall hear from you soon
            again. I hope you will have a merry Christmas and a happy New Year.</p>
