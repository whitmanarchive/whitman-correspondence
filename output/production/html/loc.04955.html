                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">I received the "Camden Post" on Tuesday morning, the 26<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst, and in the evening of
                the same day I received the "Camden Morning News"—the "screed" from "The
                Critic"—and your post card—in reply to which latter I wired to you at
                once.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It isn't possible for me to write much at present. I have read all the pieces you
                    sent—especially<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02165.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02165.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02165.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                the letter to "The Critic."—It suggests some points I should like to write
                about, but I must only note <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one</span>—and that is your
                remark that you are "still rejected by the great magazines" &amp;c.—Well—so
                much the worse for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">them</span>! It is only of a piece with your
                continued rejection by some of your leading men of letters and the absurdly
                inadequate recognition of those who seem friendly.—I could wish it were
                otherwise,—and that the solitude of soul in which you have lived might at
                last, in your old age, be cheered by the<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02166.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02166.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02166.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> advent of a completely intelligent &amp;
                loving recognition &amp; response. That you are still, in a great degree, "despised &amp;
                rejected of men" is, however, only the price you pay for your greatness, and
                corresponds with the experience of other great benefactors &amp; redeemers.—But
                there is a wise encompassing Love which transcends all our thinking—"Love like
                the light silently wrapping all"—which holds both yourself &amp; your work in safe
                and tender keeping—Future generations will love you all the more passionately
                for your rejection by your contemporaries, and we who have already come to partly
                understand you and to love you<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02167.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02167.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02167.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> also love you more proudly and tenderly because of it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your great kindness—most fatherly, most tender—to D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Johnston &amp; myself stirs my heart more deeply than I
                can tell you. We thought it a precious privilege to minister, in however slight a
                degree to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, and, behold! you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">load</span> us in return with the most unlooked for and unmerited kindnesses!
                Thanks to you from my heart—and God bless you!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot write more now but I think I will send you a slip I cut from a newspaper
                last Dec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">br</span>. I thought of sending it to you at the time &amp; will now do so.—</p>
