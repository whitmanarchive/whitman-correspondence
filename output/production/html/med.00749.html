                    The journalist Charles Allen Thorndike Rice (1851–1889) edited and
                    published the magazine in New York from 1876 until his death. Whitman's friend

                    managing editor in 1886. After Rice's death, Lloyd Bryce (1852–1915)
                    became owner and editor. At the time of this letter, William Rideing
                    (1853–1918) was assistant editor of the magazine. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00749_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00749_n1"><span>Since "Some War
