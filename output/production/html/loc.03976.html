Mont.<a href="#n0910" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0910">3</a> is helping me, he is as bad against as I am. Father<a href="#n0852b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0852b">4</a> went to the city with a load of straw today; perhaps he will be over in time to stop and see you. I believe the work is doing me good in some ways for it is making me eat more than ever</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mont. received your papers today, those giving the account of the execution, it went over to Glendale before he got it. He was much pleased with it.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt I have saved enough out of that dollar you gave me to come up and see you. I have been trying to find a day to come up and see you but cannot until we finish threshing. I have been thinking it all over and will be up on Tuesday, next, one week from tomorrow if nothing happens. I want to spend the day with you, and have a good talk, have some good cigars for me. (I know you will, won't you?) Debbie and Joe,<a href="#n1011" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1011">5</a> were home yesterday and stayed all day. Capt.

                too. Lizzie<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a> was over Saturday afternoon, stayed until late and of course I went home with her, had a good time with her, I told her about you sending your love to her, she sends you back the same, she says she would like to see you.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have been home ever since I was up to see you: there is but very little news about here now, everything is the same as when you left here. Father is about the same as when you were down. Mother is well and all the rest of the folks. Mont and all the rest sends their love to you. Will have to close as Ed<a href="#n0589b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0589b">8</a> wishes to close up the store. Will be up Tuesday if nothing happens.</p>

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
