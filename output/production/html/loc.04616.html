            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Though a stranger to you, in your Book you have been my friend, and so I salute you.
                I want to inform you that a literary club of young men to which I belong, and which
                is called the Melancholy Club, are to celebrate your Birthday this week on the third
                of June, Saturday, (at their rooms, 52 Lexington Ave., New York) with poems and
                addresses and music and supper. I cannot tell you, sir, how greatly we consider you.
                But we have adopted this method of expressing our love for you and appreciation of
                your noble music. We would be overjoyed to have you with us, could you come; and
                that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> would <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">also</span> be
                delighted, the sweet and beautiful Philosophy of your Book already discovers. We were to
                celebrate the occasion on the 31<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span></span> of this month, but college harness held some of us too tightly in
                check, and therefore we had to postpone it till the first convenient evening; which
                caused us some disappointment as we had been looking forward for many months to the
                Day of your Birth itself on which to meet in song and festivity to your honor,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thou "<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">measurless​ </span></span> sweet vocalist of Ages!"</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am urgently requested to invite you to attend; and as a Birthday token I send you
                some verses in your own heroic measure (or a poor attempt to imitate it) by one of

                which we hold you—we, a number of young men, students of Theology, Music,
                Poetry, Painting, &amp; Medicine, and devoted to you, your Champions &amp;
