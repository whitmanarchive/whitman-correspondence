            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I will just write you a line or two, anyhow. I am stopping the last three days here with Doctor and Jeannie &amp; having a very pleasant time indeed—only Jeannie has had something of a bad spell—but is quite bright &amp; comfortable this morning, &amp; presided at breakfast. William is here—which adds much indeed to the pleasure of my visit—William has not recovered from an annoying cold, yet does pretty well—I have seen Mrs. Whitman, &amp; like her—have seen her &amp; talked &amp;c. three times—have seen Miss Nora Perry—am going this afternoon to Thomas Davis's to stay two or three days, &amp; then return to New York—whence in two or three days more, to Washington.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is quite well for an old woman of 74—speaks of you—is now in her new quarters—much roomier &amp; pleasanter. Sister Martha &amp; her two little girls have come on from St. Louis, and are now living with mother. George &amp; Eddy are well. Mrs. Price &amp; her girls are well &amp; in good spirits—I am enjoying my vacation agreeably, but moderately—as becomes a gentleman of my size &amp; age.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to Mr. and Mrs. Ashton—also to Charley—also to dear little Jeannie—It will not be long, Nelly, before I shall be with you all again. Best love to you, dearest friend.</p>
