            <p class="tei_p"> Your two letters received this day. I think, after all, that my former objections to
                giving the English of the L. of G. with the translation were not so well-founded as
                they seemed, and it shall be done as you wish so far as I can see at present. I will
                gladly insert the extract from your letter in the preface, and will give Salut au Monde. We go for a month or so
                into the country soon, and from the time you get this till the end of June my
                address will be Liegau bei Radeberg, Saxony, if you have anything to say or send. I
                am sorry to hear you have been ill—hope this finds you still on the
                mend— </p>
