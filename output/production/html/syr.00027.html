                    <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">I have your postal card of the 17th, and enclose the article from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span>—an infamous article. I would give a great
                    deal to know <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">who</span> is the writer. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Is it not possible to find this out</span>?</p>
                <p class="tei_p">You mention it as in the N.Y. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Evening Post</span>, of which
                    the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span> is a weekly issue, though without
                    containing all its matter. So I am not sure that this libel was in both
                    papers.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I also enclose a press <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00110.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00110.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00110.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> copy of my reply, and of the note I subsequently addressed
                    with the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">MS</span> to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Times</span>.
                    Montgomery wrote me a very kind note, saying that the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Times</span> editor wouldn't print my article for "professional
                    reasons"—which simply means, I suppose, that dog will not eat dog, or that
                    one member of the journalistic <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">condottieri</span> will stand
                    by another in his iniquity.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">When I read the article over just now, it seemed a little better than I at first
                    thought it. I was quite ill and weighed down with <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00111.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00111.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00111.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> lassitude when I wrote
                    it,—spurred only by my indignation. Upon its return from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Times</span>, I had a vague wandering notion of sending it to
                    the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Critic</span>, as my blue pencil memorandum on the first
                    sheet indicates. But I suppose it is no use. I felt rather deterred by the
                    remembrance of Gilder's unfriendly spat at me when I was fighting that
                    contemptible clergyman, Chadwick, and was so clearly in the right. I had thought
                    of him previously as a friend of yours.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I also enclose a slip from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span> which shows <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00112.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00112.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00112.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Dr. William
                    Hand Browne in the noble and honorable light of trying to edit out of poor
                    Lanier's silly lectures, the little praise he had bestowed on you—an
                    effort baffled only by the right instincts of the poet's widow. What a lot of
                    helldevils the literati are, to be sure!</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Send me back the slips sometime.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I am glad you saw Marvin. He is the best of friends, and is firm in the
                    faith.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I hope to get away for a few days soon. I am still in charge of the office,
                    and much burdened. More anon. I got your curious Shakespeare letter. Is he
                    crazy? Au revoir.</p>
