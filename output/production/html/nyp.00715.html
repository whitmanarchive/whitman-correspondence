            <p class="tei_p">Here I am sitting up in the big chair—I got up ab't noon, (&amp; shall keep up
                an hour or two, &amp; send you my actual <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sign</span>

                back to Canada last Tuesday night, R.R. train—I am half thro' on my little
                "November Boughs"—&amp; am stuck of it &amp; proofs &amp;c—</p>
