                    reports of the poet's illness, O'Connor wrote for information on <a href="syr.00035">June 13, 1888</a> (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.75.html">Friday, April 5, 1889</a>). The almost fatal illness during the early
                    part of June is fully recorded in Traubel's entry of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.68.html"> Monday, June 4, 1888</a>. Fortunately Bucke had come to Camden on June
                    3, 1888 (see Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.67.html">Sunday, June 3, 1888</a>), and Nathan M. Baker became the poet's nurse on
                    June 10 (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html"> Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). At first Whitman resisted, but for the rest
                    of his life he was not without male nurses. On August 10 Traubel noted: "I have
                    started a Whitman fund—am trying to get a small monthly guarantee each
                    from a group of people to pay for the nurse and the extras required by Whitman's
                    persistent illness" (see Traubel's entry of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.27.html">Friday, August 10, 1888</a>). Among the contributors were Stedman (see
                    Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.31.html">Tuesday, August 14, 1888</a>), Richard Watson Gilder (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>), Josephine Lazarus (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.72.html">Tuesday, April 2, 1889</a>), and Andrew Carnegie (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.66.html">Wednesday, March 27, 1889</a>). When Whitman learned of the fund on March
                    20, 1889, "he was greatly touched: the tears came into his eyes" (Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n0119">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0119 note" id="n0119"><span>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
