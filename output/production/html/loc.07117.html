                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    Robert Ingersoll delivered the lecture: "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberty in

                    Bucke sent Traubel some advice about advertising the lecture: "I hope that you
                    will see that the Lecture or speech is boomed for all it [is] worth—we
                    want a big crowd and I see no reason why we should not have one. I am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">clearly</span> in favor of the dinner (or supper) to

                    might be saved—we want the speech eventually in a neat little book." Bucke
                    himself contributed to the advertising with "The Case of Walt Whitman and Col.

                    stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
                    alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of

                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    on <a href="loc.03001">June 1, 1890</a>: "Your name &amp; William's will
                    be associated in many ways, &amp; this loving word from you will be a comfort to
                    me for all time." Not having heard directly from him, she wrote about the
                    preface once more on <a href="loc.03002">June 30, 1890</a>. Three of
                    O'Connor's stories with a preface by Whitman were published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Three Tales: The Ghost, The Brazen Android, The Carpenter</span> (Boston and
                    New York: Houghton, Mifflin &amp; Co., 1892). The preface was included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1891),
