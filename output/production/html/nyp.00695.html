            <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I send Wm's picture given by him to me when last
                here—not knowing whether you have one like it, or w'd wish to use it, or favor
                it—But it is the one I like best— <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Of course I want it return'd to me here without
                fail</span>—Have you rec'd the "Liberty" Boston, dated Sept. 7?—I
                requested one sent you at North Perry a week ago—If not reach'd you get one in
                Boston—there is a good <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">memoriam</span> of dear W (by Horace
                Traubel)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new or significant particular with me—I continue pretty poorly &amp; uncomfortable
                brain, eyesight &amp; viscera—half-clear &amp; warmish here, after the week's
                storm—Sir Edwin Arnold, the English poet, was here to see
                me, very cheery &amp; eulogistic—aged ab't 40, quite a traveler, now bound
                (soon) to the Pacific &amp; round the world—I enclose you a picture or two
                besides—the one in the hat I call "the laughing philosopher"—I am
                sitting here alone in my big ratan arm chair in my den—Supper soon—I
                only eat two meals (no dinner) but relish them—</p>
