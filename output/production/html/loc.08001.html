                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    contractor and a publisher in London. His publishing firm, Walter Scott, was
                    based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and it was the imprint under which a
                    number of Whitman's books appeared in England. Walter Scott's managing editor
                    was bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major
                    promoters in England—worked with the firm. Rhys included a volume of
                    Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
                    prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. Walter Scott also
                    published Whitman's 1886 English edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
