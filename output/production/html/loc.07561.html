            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd a card f'm Rolleston, Ireland, that he had the first
                proofs of the German L of G. from the printing office—&amp; wish'd me to communicate with Dr Knortz—Your letters reach me &amp; are always welcome—I keep up—but
                gain not—am &amp; have been reading the latter two Carlyle books (Froude and
                Cabot)—not exactly you would say the cheery
                pabulum fit for me—raw, wet, cloudy weather here—H Gilchrist came this forenoon to inquire, but did not come up to my
                room—I guess Kennedy's MS is in abeyance yet—the Japanee Hartmann is going
                to try some <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">essay-readings</span> (European, great but here in
                America almost unknown persons &amp; art—productions &amp;c)—good luck
                to him!—("God help all wanderers" said the cute Irish kitchen girl, giving out
                some bread &amp; meat to the tramp at the gate the other day)—The strength of
                my arms &amp; shoulders remains good—the mentality grip ditto—spirits
                fairly ditto—we think of binding Nov. Boughs in wine colored silesia (a sort
                of linen—cheap)—&amp; entirely untrimm'd—</p>
