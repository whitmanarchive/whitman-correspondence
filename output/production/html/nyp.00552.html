            <p class="tei_p">If you feel like it write me soon as convenient after rec'ing this, as it is quite a
                while since I have heard from you, &amp; I am getting anxious. Nothing very different with me—I go out by my own
                volition not at all, as my power of walking &amp;c. is quite gone. I only get from
                one room to another in the house, with effort &amp; very slowly—I drive out
                fair mid-days—Sleep tolerably—appetite good—digestion
                so-so—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I write (prose pieces) from time to time yet—have one ab't "Burns" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">N. A. Review</span> for November—(they pay quite well, &amp;
                Redpath is very good to me)—Have a paper "My Book
                &amp; I" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's</span> for Jan. next—will send it you in printed slip—Shall
                probably get ready my little concluding book "November Boughs" this winter or next
                spring—I enclose Dr Bucke's last, just rec'd—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Heine</span> extract it is possible I rec'd from you, but think not—I found it very interesting. Best Love as always—</p>
