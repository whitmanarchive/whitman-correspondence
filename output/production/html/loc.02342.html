                    (1859–1926) was a writer, politician, and editor, working as sports and
                    drama editor of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Telegram</span> and managing editor
                    of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>. He founded <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    Whitman appeared on the cover of the magazine in the April 19, 1890, issue. The
                    publication was a weekly photographic news magazine, published at the Bible
                    House, the headquarters of the American Bible Society, devoted to printing and
                    distributing millions of bibles. The Bible House was located in a large and
                    iconic cast iron building at Astor Place and East Ninth Street in New York City,
                    which housed several publishing businesses and was a center of intellectual and
                    literary activity. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02342_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.02342_n1"><span>Whitman sent Minton lines
                    from section 16 of "Song of Myself": "One of the Nation of many nations, the
                    smallest the same, and the largest the same: / A Southerner soon as a Northerner
                    . . . Comrade of Californians: comrade of free North-Westerners: / Of every hue
                    and caste am I—of every rank and religion." Whitman's portrait appears on
                    the cover of the April 19, 1890, issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Illustrated
                        American</span>. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sacramento Daily Union</span> wrote that
                    this image was "Probably the finest pen-and-ink drawing that has been published
                    in this country," and attributed the illustration to Valerian Gribayédoff
                    (vol. 39, no. 3, 1890). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
