                up out of bed, &amp; was in a horrible plight, with only the wish to get the Vols.

                round to the printer's to get the corrections made—some more impressions
                struck off—but will do so if you have the least wish—I will soon send
                you a few copies as they are, with the accented e in Goethe scratch'd out, (wh' is

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    "An impromptu criticism." Bucke had written to Whitman on December 20, 1888,
                    registering at length his enthusiasm for Whitman's just-published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems and Prose</span>. Whitman decided to have Bucke's
                    letter printed for distribution among his friends and disciples, and he titled
                    it "An impromptu criticism on the 900 page Volume, 'The Complete Poems and Prose
                    of Walt Whitman,' first issued December, 1888." The first printing had several
                    typos, including the addition of an acute accent over the first "e" of "Goethe,"
                    so Whitman had the errors corrected in a second printing that was completed by
                    January 2, 1889. See Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in

                    (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
                    sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,
                    1893, and then he returned to the United States to commence his practice in
                    Alexandria, Indiana. For more information, see Bert A. Thompson, "Edward
                    Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Review</span>

                    tabulation, based upon his letters and his entries in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commonplace Book</span>, Whitman's income in 1888 amounted to at least
                    $925.04: royalties, $177.01; sales of books, $107.66; payments for
                    articles and poems, $277.00; gifts, $224.37; and miscellaneous,
                    $139.00. (The figures on book sales are to some extent conjectural, since
                    Miller had to assume Whitman charged uniform prices for his various books.) It
                    is probably of relevance to note that, beginning in 1888, Whitman's friends
                    contributed regularly to a nursing fund; hence he did not receive quite so many
                    gifts as in previous years. It is also of significance that as his health
                    deteriorated, recordings in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commonplace Book</span> were less
                    complete than hitherto. Thus there are very real discrepancies between amounts
                    he deposited periodically in the bank and receipts of money from various
                    sources. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
