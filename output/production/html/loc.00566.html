It is my wish it should be seen in Boston. Let me know how you propose to introduce it. It must be hung where the Fellows will see it,—you know what I mean. Let the light be an important thing, and dont allow any clap-trap surroundings. Let it be the thing wherever it is, at any price. I had intended as you are aware to put it in the Academy.—<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>

            <p class="tei_p">Tell me what you think. If I put it there I must enter it by the 31st—What shall I do? I wish to please you and feeling that you understand me I wait your pleasure. Write immediately for we have no time to loose</p>
