I went directly to my frame makers, the frame will be done to-morrow, (it is a beauty) and if you wish I will send it in a few days. It is my wish it should be seen in Boston. Let me know how you propose to introduce it. It must be hung where the Fellows will see it,—you know what I mean. Let the light be an important thing, and dont allow any clap-trap surroundings. Let it be the thing wherever it is, at any price. I had intended as you are aware to put it in the Academy.—
