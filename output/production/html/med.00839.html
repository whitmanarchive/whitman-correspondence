            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours rec'd—Yes, I will sit to Warren Davis the
                painter—w'd like to have it over with in five or six sittings—In May w'd
                suit me, as far as I see at present—W'd probably accept any time that might
                suit W D who had better write to me a little in advance—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am still living here &amp; comfortable &amp; in good spirits enough but probably
                near the end of my rope—badly paralyzed &amp; do not go out at all, except by
                being <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">toted</span>—Am real glad to hear from you once
                more—Wish you had told ab't y'r brother &amp; sister, &amp; the latter's
                children.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Best love &amp; remembrances to you &amp; them—I hear from Dr Bucke often—he is well—Still Superintendant in
                Canada—</p>
