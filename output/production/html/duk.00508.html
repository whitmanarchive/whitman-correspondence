                meals if he had been home my
                coughf is somewhat better to day
                i have had mustard plasters
                acrost my chest and i think it
                has done me good i feel the
                soreness of the mustard but the
                soreness and distress in my
                side is much better) last winter
                for all it was so very cold on
                the park
                i had to cover up my head
                to keep my ears from freezing
                i never had even a slight attack
                i had a letter from george) saying
                he arrived safe and was
                staying at present at the hotel
                but had been to phelidelphe
                and met one of his old army
                friends and went with him
                to try to get board at the same
                place with him but they were

                a room in a private house for
                3 dollar a week and has to get his meals
                as they dident furnish meals
                this is in phelidelphee they charged
                him 12 dollars per week at the hotel in camden

                he says he thinks he shall like his 
                position very well he went to
                see perbasco before he went away
                and he perbasco went home last friday
                and went out to see george and
                inform him i suppose in the ways
                you know perbasco is in mr
                Kingsly s
                emplois now at i beleive
                10 dolls a day i think mr Lane done it
                for his good will to george
                as
                there will be work there all winter

                work purbasco says Jeff
                is having
                a great quantity of pipe made about
                20 miles from camden
                and george
                could just as well inspect that
                and not neglect this in the least
                mr lane has wrote to Jeff and
                george wanted matt
                to write
                to him that george was there
                if he could put any thing in
                his way i told matt but

                whether she mentioned it to
                Jeff or not she said mr Lane had
                wrote to him but she would but
                walt if you write to Jeff you
                can speak about it) perbasko
                used to make as much as his wages
                they say inspecting for other parties

                buggy matty tells them all she
                only sleeps in next door
                i think sometimes it is pretty true
                i should think Jeff might tell
                by this time whether they will go
                or stay matt is well and real
                fat i tell her she lives so easy 
                and sleeps so much) i dont know

                feel much like it at present i 
                get along quite well now the new

                but i would rather have half a dozen
                buchers than the soap making they
                appear to be very quiet people and
                clean) well Walter this is quite a long
                letter for a sick woman to write) oh
