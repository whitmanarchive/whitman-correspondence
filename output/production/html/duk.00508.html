                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                    sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
                    pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or
