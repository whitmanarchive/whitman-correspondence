                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    advertisement, Whitman still had not seen proofs, much less signed the

                    was quickly resolved, and, as this letter indicates, Whitman signed photographs
                    for Cox and returned them. Cox had taken multiple photographs of Whitman in
