            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special—Am somewhat under the weather four or five days—cold in
                the head or malaria—I sent Shiell's the book 16th Sept.—McKay, my Phila: publisher,
                has just been over—paid me $77 for royalties for the last eight months—I
                paid the Camden taxes on my shanty to-day $26—The 
                photos come from Cox all right, &amp; I sign &amp; return them—Wm Carey, at
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> office, seems to be managing the sale &amp;
                financial part of the matter—I am satisfied with all—H Gilchrist the painter has gone back to England &amp; taken his picture
                with him—Morse the sculptor is still here (in
                    Phila)—I think the plaster head by him (the 2d head we call it) is the best
                thing yet. Cloudy &amp; rainy spell of weather here—I havn't been out of the
                house since last Sunday—have been amusing myself with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pepys'
                    Diary</span> (McKay sent it to me, good edn. 4 vols.)—When you come again,
                don't forget to bring my Stedman book <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">American Poets</span>—Love to Alma and Al and
                all of you—</p>
