                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Walt Whitman,</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have received from you lately "The Conservator" with Bucke's
                little article, a newspaper with a review of my Keats,
                your letter of 22 May, and the parcel by
                express—for all of which I thank you heartily. Your letter came on Monday the
                2nd; &amp; curiously I was going that evening to hear a paper about you read by a
                lady to some thirty or forty people, mostly ladies.
                After the paper, which was very sympathetic &amp; intelligently done, I read the
                people your letter and the poem you enclosed. The poem was greatly liked; and the
                message to "British friends" fitted several. I have sent that to the Athenaeum, so
                that all may know how you are going on. The contents of the parcel are delightful
                and will be always prized by me—I mean the photographs and the books in which
                you have written. It seems to me you have sent me, duplicates
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02099.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02099.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02099.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                and all, a great deal for the money. I will let you know the cost of expressage,
                because I presume you wish to keep a check on the agents—it was 7s/6d (not very
                dear, I think)—but this is of course my affair; for I make the parcel out to
                come to a good bit over £5..7..6 even in money; and there is much that money will not
                pay for.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Quite by chance I have just taken up at a stall the last part of a serial issue of a
                book called "Celebrities of the Century." The book was
                issued complete a year or two ago. I contributed the notice of you &amp; several
                others on the distinct understanding that I should say what I pleased. Now they have
                made this reissue without my knowledge, &amp; the conclusion of the article on you
                has been chopped off. I send you the thing as it is now, because it may amuse you to
                know what an eminently <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">respectable</span> firm will publish about
                you in the year 1890. They would not have cut off the end, I fancy, except to make
                room for something else; for they published
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02099.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02099.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02099.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                it all right in the book, which did not contain the notice on the next page, of Sir
                J. Whitworth.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Since receiving your parcel I have heard of something else that I want. It is
                described as "The Family Edition" of Specimen Days and Collect,—a few copies said to have been extra-illustrated
                &amp; extended in some way. If you had one left I would think it a great favor to be
                allowed to buy it. You might put my name in it &amp; just send a line on a postcard
                to let me know the cost. Some of those photographs you have sent me are really
                splendid—what a fortunate atmosphere! English photographs don't have half the
                sharpness &amp; detail.</p> 
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Always yours with affectionate respect</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">H. Buxton Forman</span>
