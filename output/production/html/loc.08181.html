                still both off duty, no one in their place and so I am pretty well tied up. I do not understand this
                last newspaper racket about your health. As far as I know (and I think I know as much as any one)
                you are abt. as you have been for the last three years (not getting any younger, but otherwise 
                unchanged), the paralysis either not extending at all or so slowly that it's increase is imperceptible—as
                to the paralysis "going to the heart" that is all rubbish—paralysis <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cannot</span>
                go to the heart. If you live untill the paralysis attacks the heart and so kills you you will live to be
                a thousand years old which is a fate I would not wish my best friend or worst enemy</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
