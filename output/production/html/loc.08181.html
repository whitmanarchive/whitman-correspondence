            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> Oct. just to hand and was glad to get it as also 
                the long piece re Schliemann which I shall read as soon as I find a few minutes. Ross &amp; 
                Barber
                still both off duty, no one in their place and so I am pretty well tied up. I do not understand this
                last newspaper racket about your health. As far as I know (and I think I know as much as any one)
                you are abt. as you have been for the last three years (not getting any younger, but otherwise 
                unchanged), the paralysis either not extending at all or so slowly that it's increase is imperceptible—as
                to the paralysis "going to the heart" that is all rubbish—paralysis <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cannot</span>
                go to the heart. If you live untill the paralysis attacks the heart and so kills you you will live to be
                a thousand years old which is a fate I would not wish my best friend or worst enemy</p>
