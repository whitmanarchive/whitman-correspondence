                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For

                    Christmas Greeting" was rejected by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Weekly</span> but
                    accepted by the "McClure Syndicate" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/6/med.00006.85.html">Monday, December 9, 1889</a>). In mid November 1889, Pedro II
                    (1825–1891), emperor of Brazil, was overthrown by a military coup. The
                    country became <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Republic of the United States of
                        Brazil</span>, with a general serving as its first President. Whitman told
                    Traubel that the poem was "a sort of handshake and hug, to show them we were
                    here, met them in the democratic spirit, warmed to something more than mere
                    formality. It is a trifle, put together in that sense, no other" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/6/med.00006.67.html">Thursday, November 21, 1889</a>). A printer's copy exists in the The
                    Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) with Whitman's pencilled corrections, yet
                    no printed copy has been located. Whitman later told Traubel that the poem was
                    not printed in the United States because of the line "More shining than the
                    Cross, more than the Crown"—which, in Whitman's view, caused great
                    "timidity" and ultimately "deterred the orthodox journalists" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/6/med.00006.136.html">Wednesday, January 29, 1890</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
