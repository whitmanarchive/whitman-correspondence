            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Are you never coming?<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">1</a> I do long &amp; long to see you. I am beginning to like New York better than I did and to have pleasant times. Had some friendly chats with Kate Hillard<a href="#n0302" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0302">2</a> last week, &amp; went with her to call on Mrs. Putman Jacobi,<a href="#n1508" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1508">3</a> who has a little baby 3 weeks old &amp; is still in her room, but has got through very nicely—She talks well, doesn't she? &amp; has a face with plenty of individuality in it. Also we went together on Saturday again to one of Miss Booth's<a href="#n3017" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3017">4</a> receptions, &amp; there met Mrs. Croly,<a href="#n1507" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1507">5</a> &amp; had the best talk about you I have had this long while. I like her cordiality—we are going to her reception on Sunday &amp; to one at Mrs. Bigelow's<a href="#n1509" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1509">6</a> Wednesday. It is true there is not much that can be called social enjoyment at these crowded receptions, but they enable you to start many acquaintanceships, some of which turn out lasting good. We had some fine harp playing &amp; a witty recital at Miss Booth's. Miss Selous is back in America. I should not wonder if she comes on here soon. Bee<a href="#n1512" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1512">7</a> is living at the Dispensary now, instead of in the Hospital, &amp; finds the comparatively outdoor life—&amp; the freedom from being "whistled" for all hours of the day and night as she was there—a wonderful refreshment. That coloured lady, Mrs. Wiley, whom you met once at our house, is her fellow labourer &amp; room mate at the Dispensary. Bee likes her much. I am not sure whether you know the Gilders?<a href="#n1034" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1034">8</a> We spent a couple of hours delightfully with them yesterday afternoon. She has a very attractive face, a musical voice, &amp; such a sweet smile. They are going to Europe for a four months' holiday this spring. I admire the simple, unconventional way in which they live. Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">9</a> is working away in the best spirits. He is going to paint that bowling alley subject on a large scale. Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">10</a> is sitting by me with her nose in the French Dictionary, working away at a novel of Balzac's. I have had scarcely any letters from England lately!—and the papers bring none but dismal tidings; nevertheless I don't believe our sun is going down yet awhile—we shall emerge from this dark crisis the better, not the worse, because compelled to grapple with the evils that have caused it, instead of passively enduring them. Please give friendly remembrance from me to your brothers &amp; sister. Have you been at Kirkwood lately, I wonder? I suppose Timber Creek is frozen over. Good-bye, dear Friend. Write soon, or better still Come!</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was the translator of Dante's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Banquet</span> (1889) and the
                    editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret

                        Blavatsky</span> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Whitman's 
                    close friend, the women's rights activist Abby Price
                    (see Whitman's <a href="pml.00040">September 9, 1873</a>, letter to
                    Price). According to a letter from Whitman's mother—Louisa Van Velsor Whitman—to Helen Price
                    on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
                    Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
                    writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his <a href="duk.00657">June 23,
                        1873</a>, letter to his friend, the former publisher and fellow clerk Charles Eldridge. Hillard and Whitman first met in
                    person on February 28, 1876, and Whitman sent her a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> on July 27, 1876  (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Writing
                    to Whitman on <a href="loc.01323">September 13, 1871</a>, Moncure D.
                    Conway, who acted as Whitman's agent in England, quoted from a letter he had received 
                   from Katharine Hillard: "I have made a
                    discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that I never
                    half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed it.
                    To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
                    reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and continue
                    beyond." </span></span> [<a href="#r0302">back</a>]</li><li id="n1508">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n1508 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n1508"><span>Mary Corinna Putnam Jacobi
