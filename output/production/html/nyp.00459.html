                were pretty dark, big clouds, big enemies on the horizon, some bad letters sent them
                threats from the "Society," they did not flinch but went on getting out the new

                    the ground <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that your book must pass unmolested through the

                    into libraries, and accepted by the literary class, cannot be brought under the
                    operation of the statutes respecting taboo matter. This is cheering. We owe this
                    victory to the tact, bonhomie, energy and gallantry of Ingersoll, who put the
