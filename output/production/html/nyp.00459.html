            <p class="tei_p">Yours rec'd—yes indeed it is a cheering &amp; very important victory—most important coming just at this nick of
                time—vivifies Rees Welsh much (as I saw yesterday) &amp; gives an absolute
                cement to what perhaps was not so entirely <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">set</span> as I could
                have wished—though as I get along with them, &amp; versed, I am well satisfied
                with R W &amp; Co. and my prospect with them—Though Thursday &amp; Friday last
                were pretty dark, big clouds, big enemies on the horizon, some bad letters sent them
                threats from the "Society," they did not flinch but went on getting out the new
                edition as fast as possible—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now</span> of course they feel
                entrenched &amp; good heart—The printing is done
                at Sherman &amp; Co's. cor 7th &amp; Cherry, the best printing office in
                Philadelphia. My L of G plates having been sent on there from Rand &amp; Avery's,
                Boston—&amp; I shall begin on "Specimen Days" there in about a week—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I havn't emerged from the house to-day, (it is July heat, oppressive)—but I
                shouldn't wonder if <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the L of G. officially ordered to pass
                    unmolested through the mails</span> was itemized generally over the land
                everywhere to-day, as the Telegraphic Associated Press chargé here in Phila
                told me yesterday afternoon he intended to send it generally—the Phila: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> here is very friendly—it has three short pieces
                in to-day, a first-rate acc't of the P O Dept. decision &amp; commending it
                editorially—Talcott Williams on the P[ress] is an
                ardent friend—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William, I wish you would get an authentic copy of the P. O. letter order &amp; send
                me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">soon</span>, if you can—When you see Col. Ingersoll say he
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
