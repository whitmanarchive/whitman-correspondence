                too much occupied to write. I got the paper you sent with the O.W. Holmes, "Atlantic Monthly" piece, but the

                very good specimen too) Such a book as L.of G. and the mentality that goes with such
                a book is as far as possible from his ideal. The haughty, arrogant, masterful spirit
                of the poem evidently repells him, while the insouciant freedom of L. of G. (perhaps the greatest charm
                of all) has no attraction for

                again—of course you have said it all before (and more than once) but the

                they were mixed up in and had to do with it, the work there is in starting a new
