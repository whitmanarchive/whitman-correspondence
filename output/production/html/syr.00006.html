                said Noel was very much engrossed with politics, and it is evident he is engrossed with

                see Rossetti again but I do not seem to care much about Conway. I doubt if I could ever 
                fraternize with him. He does not impress me as an eminently sincere and loveable person. It 
                may be very cruel for me to say so, but he seems to me like a kind of literary broker, ever

                a high flown literary cockney, yet I soon saw that it was of no moment 
                and that he was a genuine good fellow. He praises Prof. Dowden whom he has met and says I 
                will like him. I intend to go to Ireland if possible, though it looks doubtful now as 
                Assistant Secretary Richardson<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">8</a> has impressed me into his service here &amp; 
                proposes to retain me &amp; my party a week or two later than we had contemplated staying. I 
                am at work in the office or Branch of the Treasury Dept here with 4 or 5 other clerks and the 
                beautiful October days are slipping by and I am not tramping about Stratford or up the mountains

                as I had promised myself I should be. I have seen enough of cities, &amp; streets &amp; art 
                and pictures &amp; museums to stand me all the rest of my days, and am in a hurry to set my 
                face westward.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">9</a> I spent about a week in Paris &amp; got enough of it. I presume I was a little 
                surprised when I went from here, so that I did not relish Paris as I should have done had I 
                come to it fresh. It is certainly a very beautiful city and very clean &amp; tasteful. The ruins 
                are in excellent taste &amp; are the best behaved ruins I ever saw, and the Parisians are the 
                best mannered people I ever saw. I think the waiters in the Hotels could give lessons to princes. 
                They bring you fried eggs on a perfumed napkin, and the napkin on beautiful tissue paper &amp; 
                the whole on a china plate (my paper has got mixed up)

                and one hardly knows whether to fall to &amp; eat or to lift up his hands in admiration. Yet for 
                all that I was not deeply impressed with Paris. The aspect of the streets is very monotonous. 
                See one block &amp; you have seen it all. It all seems to have been built the same day &amp; planned 
                by the same architect &amp; the stone were unmistakably all dug from the same quarry. Hence it is 
                not picturesque or quaint or homely like London or grand either: it is brilliant &amp; correct. I 
                was much disappointed in the French soldiers; they are certainly a very inferior looking lot of men; 
                small &amp; dirty &amp; indifferent. I find this is the impression of all Americans I have talked 
                with who have seen them.

                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or

                    unlike Henry James's in a Parisian gallery: "I saw for the first time what power
                    &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I felt for a moment
                    what great genius was in this field.…I had to leave them &amp; sit
                    down.…My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these
                    things all at once…It is like the grandest organ music put into form."
                    Whitman wrote in the margin: "Splendid off hand letter from John
