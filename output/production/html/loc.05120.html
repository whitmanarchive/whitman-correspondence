                more interest here, more sympathy and more indignation felt
                about the Presidents attempted murder, than if he was a European sovereign. From
                all sides, I think, the world looks to America; we love our own lands as much as
                you, but we feel that the future of the race is being decided there. Political
                corruption and public dishonesty are instinctively felt to be far more significant,
                occurring in America than in Germany or England, and we have been hearing so much
                about them lately that everyone's mind <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01062_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01062_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01062_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>has been bent in expectation towards
                each new President, each striking turn of events in the U.S.; thinking that the time
                has come at last when something will be done to justify our hopes. We have thought
                we saw it being done since—Garfield's election—Hercules letting in the
                cleansing flood. Now, rightly or wrongly, this impression has been immensely
                strengthened. When we heard the President was dead it was as if we heard of a
                martyrdom. Now that the reports are more and more favourable everyday, it seems to
                us as if the good cause had assuredly triumphed in the first wrestle. I don't know
                how far these impressions of the state of things are true; but they have
                verisimilitude. I liked so much all I could hear of President Garfield. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01063_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01063_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01063_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>Is it not
                wonderful and inscrutable that out of the confusion and slander and insidious
                intrigue that seems to attend every Presidential election a man like that should
                have emerged? Things look to me every way
                    as if the people were awaking.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I see your friend R. M. Bucke has brought out a
                    book on 'Man's Moral Nature'—I must get it. I saw it noticed &amp; praised
                    in the 'Spectator' a few days ago—the critic said that "Mr. Bucke appeared
                    to be an ardent admirer of Walt Whitman—hence, perhaps, some of the
                    obscurities in the volume—which, we candidly confess, are beyond us." The Spectator is an excellent (weekly)
                    paper—thoughtful, honest, manly; Radical in politics, but in religion
                    belonging to <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01064_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01064_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01064_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                    that rather vapid sect, the Neo-Christian or Broad Church. Barring this latter
                    particular there is a very great deal in the 'Spectator' which might be written
                    out of you; and I have no doubt that if you had thrown your works into the form
                    of systematic treatises and written in a strictly refined cultured and
                    gentlemanlike way, you might have gained the approbation of the Spectator,
                    possibly even of the Saturday Review, to which latter journal you are still a
                    thorn in the flesh, of the first magnitude.</p>
