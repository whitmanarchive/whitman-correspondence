                all sides, I think, the world looks to America; we love our own lands as much as
                you, but we feel that the future of the race is being decided there. Political
                corruption and public dishonesty are instinctively felt to be far more significant,
                occurring in America than in Germany or England, and we have been hearing so much

                each new President, each striking turn of events in the U.S.; thinking that the time
                has come at last when something will be done to justify our hopes. We have thought
                we saw it being done since—Garfield's election—Hercules letting in the
                cleansing flood. Now, rightly or wrongly, this impression has been immensely
                strengthened. When we heard the President was dead it was as if we heard of a
                martyrdom. Now that the reports are more and more favourable everyday, it seems to
                us as if the good cause had assuredly triumphed in the first wrestle. I don't know
                how far these impressions of the state of things are true; but they have
                verisimilitude. I liked so much all I could hear of President Garfield. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01063_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01063_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01063_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01063_large.jpg</span>Is it not

                    out of you; and I have no doubt that if you had thrown your works into the form
                    of systematic treatises and written in a strictly refined cultured and
                    gentlemanlike way, you might have gained the approbation of the Spectator,
                    possibly even of the Saturday Review, to which latter journal you are still a

                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first

                    (1837–1902), a Canadian psychiatrist, became an intimate friend of Whitman
                    and wrote the first complete life of the poet (see the letter from Rolleston to
                    Whitman of <a href="loc.05148">September 27, 1883</a>). The review to
                    which Rolleston refers appeared in the June 4, 1881 issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Spectator</span> (54, 742). The reviewer presents as the main
                    thesis of Bucke's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Man's Moral Nature</span> (New York, 1879) the
                    concept that love and faith are the basic elements of all progress and that
                    Christianity is but "one step in an immense, perhaps an infinite series." The
                    exact reading of the quotation given by Rolleston is: "The author of this essay

                    his whole writing career. When Whitman sent a copy of his newly published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> to the periodical with a suggestion that
                    it be favorably reviewed, he evoked the editor's comment that "If the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> should come into anybody's possession,
                    our advice is to throw them instantly behind the fire." Representative of the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Review's</span> attitude is an article in the March 18, 1876
                    issue written in answer to a current drive by Whitman's friends to relieve his
                    financial distress. It begins, "Whitman, it may be explained, is an American
                    writer who some years back attracted attention by a volume of so-called poems
                    which were chiefly remarkable for their absurd extravagance and shameless
                    obscenity, and who has since, we are glad to say, been little heard of among
                    decent people," and continues with such descriptions of his writing as a "stock
                    of garbage," "so-called poetry," and "Whitman wares." The article even calls
                    Whitman a "dirty bird which is shunned on account of its unclean habits." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
