                slung over his shoulder—a carpenter, one who could read &amp; write, a rare
                thing for a workman in those days; soon he came to be made a land steward for a large estate,
                &amp; got on like a "house on fire" now his son Isaac Evans lives in 
                Griff house &amp; is a rich country gentleman. The character of Adam Bede is a
                portrait of her father, I will send it to you if you have not already read it? Tell
                me in your next letter. G Eliot was very fond of her father, and the only time he
                was severe with her, was

                    once, when, she was a young woman at the time, a great student,
                and I suppose after a great deal of reflection and conning G Eliot came to the conclusion that
                to go to church and mumble a creed you no longer believed in was intolerable, and so, she told her
                father, for the first time, that she could not go to church any more; so Old Mr.
                Evans said 'you shall not live in my house then' she was greatly distressed but finally
                agreed to go to church. I am sketching her house, and a bit of her garden that she was particularly fond of, it makes quite
                a pretty little picture. I wish that I could show it to you, albeit, I can't.</p>

                George Eliot's Niece) has just returned from the Highlands; a fresh, lively, candid, pleasing,
                plain woman, rather churchy, but not obtrusively so; altogether very good fun. I
                had a jolly game of tennis on their lawn,—a lawn such as you Americans dont dream of!!—with them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went to Astley church this morning, an ancient church. The church
                was nearly empty, the clergyman was late—presently, I heard a scuffle in the
                    belfry, I turned and saw a big raw
                country-bumpkin boy hastily donning his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">white surplus</span>! He strides up the aisle; buries his face in his
                hands, on kneeling, with the exception of one eye which squints at the new comer, who is busy trying to find his place in the prayer book. The <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nnk tei_unclear_cert_low">raw</span> young Rector reads with a
                musical voice a curious contradiction to his face. I afterwards learned that he
                hunts (an unusual thing for a parson.) and on occasion can swear ably.</p>
