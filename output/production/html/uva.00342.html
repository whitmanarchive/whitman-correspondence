                    New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> in 1858. Whitman evidently knew House as
                    early as 1857, for, in his "Autograph Notebook—1857" (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection), he pasted a calling card signed by House. During the Civil War,
                    House was a war correspondent for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>. See also
