                    <p class="tei_p">This letter dates to October 16 or 23, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
                        letter October 10, 1866, and Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's date
                        (see Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New
                        York University Press, 1961–77], 1:293, n. 57). Bucke and Miller's
                        date is incorrect: the letter dates just over a year later. Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman cannot date to the year 1866 because
                        Walt in his October 16, 186[6?] fragment states that "I have not heard any
                        thing from you the last week." If this letter dates October 10, 1866
                        (Wednesday), Walt would have heard from Louisa "last week," if his
                        fragmentary letter dates October 16, 1866 (Tuesday). The second, decisive
                        factor in dating this letter to October 1867 is Louisa's housing situation,
                        which though unpleasant in October 1866 did not become seriously unsettled
                        until after Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman departed for St. Louis in May
                        1867. Louisa's housing difficulties became acute in 1867, after Jeff's
                        departure, which led his wife, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman to leave the
                        Pacific Street home and stay with Gordon F. Mason's family in Towanda,
                        Pennsylvania, from June to September 1867 (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New
                        York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42). Louisa in this letter
                        conveys from George Washington Whitman a description of a Portland Avenue
                        lot that Walt could be interested in purchasing. The fragment in which Walt
                        offers to raise $2000 is in response to this letter. Miller's
                        conjectured date for Walt's fragmentary letter must be rejected in favor of
                        a few days after this letter, to a range from October 18 to October 30, 1867
                        (cf. Walt Whitman's <a href="duk.00383">October 16, 1867</a> letter
                        fragment to Louisa, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, 1:293).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Because this letter dates a year later than previously determined by Bucke
                        and Miller, to October 16 or 23, 1867, the fragmentary letter from Walt
                        Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman that Miller assigned to 1866 must be
                        reassigned, and Kim Roberts's calendar of Walt's Washington boarding places
                        must be revised as well. According to Roberts, Walt moved to 468 M Street
                        South (Graysons) in January 1865, to 364 13th Street West in February 1866,
                        and to 472 M Street South (same house as Graysons, then under Mrs. Newton
                        Benedict) in 1867 (<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00933.pdf">"A Corrected Map of Whitman's Washington Boarding Houses and Work
                            Places,"</a>

                        But the date that Roberts assigns for Walt's move from the Graysons
                        (February 1866) is incorrect. Walt in summer 1866 was boarding with the
                        Graysons: "Mrs. Grayson gives me plenty of good vegetables, peas string
                        beans, squash [...] the house is very pleasant this weather—as cool as
                        it can be any where" (see his <a href="duk.00381">June 26, 1866</a>
