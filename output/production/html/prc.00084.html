            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for your good letter—I have had my hands full the last six or eight
                weeks getting my new book in shape, seeing to every thing, and watching the proofs
                day &amp; night<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—(I have had to read the proofs at
                night all through)—But now it is over &amp; I begin to feel free
                again—(And yet I must say I kind of enjoy it, &amp; should like to go through
                the same job two or three times a year)—I have had the mighty good luck to
                keep well this summer all through—my usual bad spell (I always expect one
                after I have felt pretty good awhile) has not come on—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear boy I am glad you too keep so well &amp; are having good quiet times—I
                envy you being down there in the country—(I always thought Clementon<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> a much pleasanter spot than you[r] folks <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="appeared​ ">appear'd</span>​  to think it)—I could be satisfied to live
                there—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I got a long letter from Herbert<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—he is
                getting along well—traveling and painting—I have also <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  a letter
                from Edward Carpenter<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—he is well—he sends
                his love to you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Hank perhaps while I am writing this (Sunday noon) you are over home—I
                wish I was there with you all—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—As I finish my letter a lady opposite is singing &amp; playing the hymn
                "Nearer my god to Thee"—how beautiful it sounds—</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you my darling young brother</span>
