                the big old chair—have had something to see to in printing my books &amp; it
                has probably done me more good than harm—&amp; it all (the printing) has gone
                on &amp; is going on satisfactorily—Herbert<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">2</a> has arrived
                all right &amp; is stopping over in Philadelphia—quite busy—he is to
                have a studio there &amp; paint—rather thinks (but it has not yet been settled
                definitely) he has secured a studio already—He has been over to see me—a
                short visit this time—He looks hearty &amp; handsome, red &amp; fat &amp;
                first rate—he will come down before long &amp; see you &amp; then tell you
                more fully his plans—wh' he did not to-day—but I believe he thinks
                stopping, working &amp; painting here for a year to come—</p>

                yourself—I am sitting here alone up in my room, writing this—Mrs:
                    Davis<a href="#n6113" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6113">7</a> has been an hour or two ago out to the City Hall to

                stole a nice valuable silk sun umbrella from her—gone—Hope this will
