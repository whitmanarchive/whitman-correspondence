            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope this letter will reach you in good health and spirits—I wish I could
                share some of mine with you! I am back again at Oxford and at work once more. I
                realize more and more what a privilege it is to be here, so many chances for
                education and development. I am studying Greek &amp; Latin <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00140_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00140_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00140_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00140_large.jpg</span> literature &amp; Greek art, I want

            <p class="tei_p">Apart from one's studies there is only too much that is delightful here. I row on the
                river every afternoon, all the men in the college who do not know how to row in the
                right way and yet want to learn, go down in the afternoons &amp; sit in the barge
                that belongs to their particular college, &amp; the experienced oarsmen take them
                out, four at a time &amp; "coach" them.</p>
