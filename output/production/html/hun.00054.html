                    he was at Glendale from April 22 to 27 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.). This was his "excuse" for not replying to
                    Burroughs's (lost) letter of April 10. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_hun.00054_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="hun.00054_n2"><span>Emerson died on April 26,
                    1882. On April 29 Whitman sent to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span> "By
                    Emerson's Grave," which appeared in the issue of May 6, along with Burroughs's
                    "Emerson's Burial Day." The poet received $3 for the piece (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book). It was included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> (ed.
                    Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
                    290–291). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_hun.00054_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="hun.00054_n3"><span>With his letter of <a href="loc.01140">May 1</a>, Burroughs included a communication from
                    O'Connor dated April 28, in which the latter related how he had convinced
                    associates in his office that the Boston censorship was "the greatest outrage of
                    the century" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                    Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.51.html">Friday, December 21, 1888</a>, 351). O'Connor wrote to Richard Maurice
                    Bucke about the matter on April 29 (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
                    212). On May 1, Burroughs wrote to Gilder, probably Richard, "So far as this is
                    the wish of the city of Boston, I pray for the wrath of Sodom and Gomorrah to
                    descend upon her" (Barrus, 211). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_hun.00054_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="hun.00054_n4"><span>In reprinting Burroughs's
                    letter of <a href="loc.01140">May 1</a>, Traubel interpolated an
                    explanation of the loan: "This was money in my possession belonging to Walt. J.
                    B. 1912." (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.51.html">Friday, December 21, 1888</a>, 350). Burroughs and Traubel, however, were
                    in error, for on January 27, 1883, Whitman noted: "returned $100 to John
                    Burroughs" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). See also Barrus, 210. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_hun.00054_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="hun.00054_n5"><span>Whitman had sent the
                    article to the magazine on April 8, and on April 27 received $25 "with
                    'sincere thanks'" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
