            <p class="tei_p">I got your card of the 19th, (last Thursday's) and was greatly cheered and comforted thereby—the hand writing was so bold and vigorous. I had been feeling depressed and sorrowful—perhaps 
             my own bad state had something to do with it; but anyhow, the brave hand-writing was like Chevy Chace<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> to Sidney,

            <p class="tei_p">I have sent the "Today" to Dr. Bucke.<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">2</a> The article was pleasing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Transcripts</span> you sent, had a characteristic speech by Littlebill Winter.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Whitman commented: "Some of my enemies are malignants—for instance,
                    Littlebill Winter, as O'Connor calls him, . . . and others of that

                    the so-called "Baconian theory." Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was an English
                    philosopher, scientist, statesman, and author. Bacon's personal notebooks and
                    works came under scrutiny during the nineteenth-century because of suspicions
                    that he had written plays under the pen-name William Shakespeare in order to
                    protect his political office from material some might find objectionable. For

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
