                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Won't you do me the very great favor to write me a few lines regarding the condition of my sister, 
                Mrs. H. L. Heyde. I am sure, from what I hear, that it is mainly to your medical skill, 
                and your kindness as a good man, that she got through her late illness. 
                She seems by her letters to be left in an extremely nervous state. 
                Doctor, please write me as fully as you think proper. Though we have never met personally, 
                I have heard of you from my mother &amp; sister. I must ask you to keep this letter, 
                and the whole matter, strictly confidential, &amp; mention it to no person. My sister in a late letter, 
                wished me to write you &amp; thank you for your great kindness to her.
            </p>
