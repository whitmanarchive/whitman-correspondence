            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs came in mid-day mail—thanks—Dr B[ucke] went
                back to Canada Monday night—the practical outsetting of the meter enterprise
                collapsed at the last hour—(but it is settled that it is a genuine &amp;
                valuable invention)—O'C[onnor] recuperated from the
                epileptic fits, &amp; at last acc'ts was in bed very weak, but quite over them,
                &amp; what could be call'd (mildly) improving—you know he has no use at all of
                the lower legs (knees to feet) from what appears to be absolute paralysis,
                abnegation—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Review</span> (March 2) has a rather curious <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hot &amp; cold</span>—I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">would but dare
                        not</span> sort of notice of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: B.</span> &amp; me, in wh' O'C's
                and Dr B's names are toss'd ab't superficially &amp; with attempted
                sarcasm—(You are invited to see what <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> may be
                destined to)—Horace T continues faithful &amp;
                regular—was in here two hours ago—I sympathize too with Mr &amp; Mrs Sanborn—I count on
                    Burroughs coming out from his hole yet—Lawyer Harned &amp; wife have
                just call'd on me, both welcome (they have fine children &amp; sometimes bring
                them)—I am sitting here yet as one held by a heavy chain or coil—Yes
                wonder I get along as I do, as well upon the whole, for I understand how <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">much worse</span> all might be—Love to you &amp; to Mrs.
