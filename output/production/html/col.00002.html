                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Conway,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I send (in the mail for printed matter,) same time as this, duplicate printed copies
                of a poem I have written, "Passage to India," in which I endeavor to celebrate in my
                own way, the modern engineering masterpieces, the Pacific Railroad &amp; the Suez
                Canal—in fact the great modern material practical energy &amp;
                works—&amp; then make of them as heights &amp; apices whereby to reach freest,
                widest, loftiest spiritual fields. But you will see what I have written. It will
                make from 12 to 14, 15, or 16 ordinary pages.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Can I take the liberty of asking you to seek to dispose of the piece, if eligible, to
                some London magazine? It will not be printed here in any magazine—I reserve
                the right to print it in future book. The price, time, selection of magazine, and in
                fact all the points of that sort, I leave absolutely to you—<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">My address remains as before at this office &amp; city. Nothing new or very different
                with my affairs. I remain in good health &amp; spirits.</p>
