      <p class="tei_p">I received yours of the 9th—and was right glad to hear from you, and to get such an
        affectionate letter. We have had gay times here this week, with what they call the
          "Carnival"<a href="#n0140" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0140">3</a>—it continued two days &amp; nights. The nights were
        the best. Every thing was lit up, and it was like a scene of enchantment. The crowds of
        spectators were countless. Hundreds and even thousands mixed in, the second afternoon &amp;
        night in fancy dresses, or wore masks—&amp; went around having fun. Lots of women were
        out, some of them as full of sport as the men—The principal street here is very wide,
        I should think three times as wide as Broadway. This was the scene of operations. All the
        vehicles were turned off, then at certain hours let on again for a while, for driving &amp;
        races—there were some splendid horses—Less drinking than you would have
        supposed—No musses, &amp; no accidents. I send you a paper. Last night however was a
        murder, a man I knew well by sight, a gambler called "Sonny James"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> was killed. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">With me all goes about the same. I work about 6 hours every day, mostly writing—am
        well &amp; hearty, travel around out doors quite a good deal—&amp; keep up a cheerful
          heart.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> Johnny,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> you say you should
        like to see me—Well, no more than I should to see you, my darling<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a> boy. I wish we were together this minute, &amp; you had employment
        so we could remain with each other, if you would feel satisfied to be so.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">8</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Have<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">9</a> you got work of any kind there in Brooklyn? Write to me,
          Jack,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">10</a> &amp; let me know all particulars.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">11</a> Love to you, dear son,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">12</a> &amp; good
        bye for this time. </p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Flood was a streetcar conductor in New York, known, according to an
                        unidentified notation on his letter to Walt Whitman, as "Broadway Jack."
                        According to date entries in an address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection
                        of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #109), Walt Whitman saw
                        Flood on September 30, 1868, and October 5, 1868, and rode with him on his
                        Second Avenue car; Flood had been a conductor for ten years. After Whitman's
                        return to Washington, there was a brief correspondence, consisting of four
                        known letters from Whitman (<a href="med.00403">November 22, 1868</a>,
                            <a href="loc.01595">December 12, 1868</a>, <a href="loc.01596">February 23, 1871</a>, and <a href="loc.01597">March 8,
                            1871</a>) and one from the young man. Flood, somewhat better educated
                        than some of Walt Whitman's other conductor friends, wrote on <a href="yal.00124">January 11, 1869</a>: "Sir, It is with great
                        pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand to address a few lines to you." He
                        informed Walt Whitman that he had lost his position on New Year's Eve and
                        that he was now seeking another job: "I shall still continue to correspond
                        and can never forget your kind friendship towards me. . . . Your True and
                        Ever intimate friend." According to the first listing of his name in the New
                        York Directory, in 1872–1873, he was at that time either in the milk
                        business or a milkman.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The date of this letter is based on Walt Whitman's reference to Flood's
                        unemployment: on <a href="yal.00124">January 11, 1869</a>, Flood wrote
                        that he had been "discharged" on New Year's Eve. Walt Whitman's first
                        salutation was, "Dear boy." The frequent alterations in this letter are
                        interesting: Walt Whitman softened his affectionate terms, and attempted to
                        make the relationship that of a father and son.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n0140">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0140 note" id="n0140"><span>To celebrate the paving of Pennsylvania Avenue, the
