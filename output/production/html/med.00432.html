                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Walt Whitman:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am grieved to hear that you have been so unwell and can
                only trust that your physician is a true prophet, and that you will recover and be
                as well as ever. I have myself known a case of cerebral
                an√¶mia in a young lady living near me. She lost her mind and no one who saw her
                believed she could live; but under the superintendence of a good doctor she has
                perfectly recovered and looks plumper and fresher than ever she did before.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This is the first letter I have written for weeks, and I am afraid I write rather
                obscurely, for my hand and arm have been crippled with rheumatism (I hope it is not
                gout), and I am not yet perfectly recovered.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was beholden to you for your Democratic Vistas, and if
                I did not answer and acknowledge them I regret to have done so; but if you knew how
                great the mass of my correspondence is, and how much I dislike letter-writing, I
                doubt not, you would forgive me easily.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I next hear of or from you may the news be that you are fully re-established in
                your old vigor and body: Meanwhile believe me</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours ever</span>
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">A Tennyson</span>
