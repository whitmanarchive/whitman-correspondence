                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Walt Whitman:<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a></span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am grieved to hear<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> that you have been so unwell and can
                only trust that your physician is a true prophet, and that you will recover and be
                as well as ever.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I have myself known a case of cerebral
                anæmia in a young lady living near me. She lost her mind and no one who saw her
                believed she could live; but under the superintendence of a good doctor she has
                perfectly recovered and looks plumper and fresher than ever she did before.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This is the first letter I have written for weeks, and I am afraid I write rather
                obscurely, for my hand and arm have been crippled with rheumatism (I hope it is not
                gout), and I am not yet perfectly recovered.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was beholden to you for your Democratic Vistas,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> and if
                I did not answer and acknowledge them I regret to have done so; but if you knew how
                great the mass of my correspondence is, and how much I dislike letter-writing, I
                doubt not, you would forgive me easily.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I next hear of or from you may the news be that you are fully re-established in
                your old vigor and body: Meanwhile believe me</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson, 
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> [New York: F. P.
                    Harper, 1896], 223). Tennyson's first letter to Whitman is dated <a href="med.00410">July
                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00432_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00432_n1"><span>According to Donaldson, this letter is postmarked:

                    publish in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> magazine. Two of these essays
                    appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>: "Democracy" was published in the
                    December 1867 issue and "Personalism" in the May 1868 issue. Whitman submitted
                    the third essay, "Orbic Literature," to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>, but
                    it was not published in the magazine. For more information on this work, see
