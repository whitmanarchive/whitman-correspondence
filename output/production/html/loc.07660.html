            <p class="tei_p">A perfect day—sunny cool—I felt easier this morning when I got
                up—(anticipate better feelings when the cooler weather comes—but we
                shall see)—Mr and Mrs Edward Coates have been over to see me—a cheery
                nice little visit—her atmosphere &amp; talk were medicinal &amp;
                inspiriting—he bo't the centennial ed'n—$10—I have had a good
                letter from O'Connor—also f'm Kennedy—the
                little "Old Age's Lambent Peaks" appears in the just out <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>—Maurice, I should like you to have my mare Nettie and
                phaeton (if it should come in) as pay for the $200 I owe you—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I am deliberate ab't
                it</span>—the only thing is whether you could take them in—W'd that work
                well, &amp; be desirable? Could you have any one who w'd take the mare &amp; wagon
                &amp; see them right to deliver to you? If so I wish it so—The vols: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov Boughs</span> and the big book will be good bits of typography
                &amp; press work, I think—no special news ab't me—all
                comfortable—</p>
