                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    visited Whitman at his Camden home a number of times, and he was quite fond of
                    their company. Florence (1850–1927) was a well-known and widely published
                    poet and a friend of the English essayist and poet Matthew Arnold, who
                    frequently visited the Coates' home in Germantown, Philadelphia. Edward
                    (1846–1921) was a businessman and widely admired patron of the arts, who
                    chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
                    Arts, where he worked closely with artist Thomas Eakins. Whitman expressed great
                    admiration for Florence Earle Coates; see, for example, Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.26.html">Thursday, August 9, 1888</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r4187">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07660_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="loc.07660_n2"><span>William Douglas O'Connor

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
