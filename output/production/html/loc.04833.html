                have been a happy joyful release from the heavy cares &amp; anxieties 
                of several weeks past. Do not think us thoughtless or
                inconsiderate, or altogether selfish that we welcome your 
                partial recovery with so great a joy. The world has seemed to us,
                during your illness, half emptied of its warmth &amp; love. 
                We have learned, in bitterness &amp; grief, how much the love
                between us means &amp; how deep it goes. And it is an immense 
                joy to us to find that it is to be ours still.</p>

                    Whitman had come down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his

                    never recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel
                    Longaker of Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care
                    during his final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4b">back</a>]</li><li id="n4267">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4267 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4267"><span>Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
