                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    the poet to answer his letter on <a href="loc.02601">March 12</a>. Over
                    two months later, on <a href="rut.00005">May 24</a>, Whitman responded,
