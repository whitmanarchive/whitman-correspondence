            <p class="tei_p">Your book has come so nice and fresh like a new pot-cheese in a clean napkin—I
                have read the first piece—"Look Out"—all through and thought it fully
                equal to anything in the past, and looked over the rest of the pages—doesn't
                seem to me to deserve the depreciatory tone in which you speak of it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dr. Bucke went to England April 14—I rec'd a letter
                from Wm. O'C[onnor], and his little book.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am much the same as of late—made out very handsomely with my lecture April
                15th—$674—have seen Gilder—Early
                summer here—I have a new horse—very good—</p>
