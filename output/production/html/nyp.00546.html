                valuable, for the purpose you spoke of—(if I rightly understood
                it)—Symonds has leisure, has long been a reader of L of G.—&amp; I have
                heard has for some time been wanting to have something to say in print about
                it—If possible send him at first a copy of your complete book, in proof from
                the types, or type-written in slips, complete<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—In
                fact get two or three such copies, &amp; send me one in advance—No doubt I
                would see many important corrections to be made—or additions—or
                elisions—Maybe (though may-be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> too)—J A S
                would like the chance of giving his say, in such introduction—I dont think
                well of requesting any thing from Dowden<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>

                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    encouraged to undertake a longer study after Whitman's praise of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Poet as A Craftsman</span> (see the letter from Whitman to
                    Kennedy of <a href="rut.00003">December 2, 1885</a>). Kennedy's letter of
                        <a href="loc.02893">February 5</a> had been filled with ambitious
                    plans: "The book on you that I had been contemplating for some years is coming
                    bravely to the birth. It has burst from me as from a ripe pomegranate, its seeds
                    come from me with throes. I have been 2 weeks in a fever of parturition. . . .
                    Knortz has been at me twice to make this book, &amp; I hope you will not be
                    displeased. . . . Dr. Bucke's book is invaluable, but it lacks profundity &amp;
                    literary knack in its treatment of the work (analysis) &amp; estimate of the
                    problems involved. In fact I find it quite inadequate in these respects."
                    Kennedy of course, did not know that Bucke's book was really Whitman's book. On
                        <a href="loc.02895">April 19</a> Kennedy again lauded his book ("Walt
                    Whitman, the Poet of Humanity"): "I have completed (rough finish) my seven
                    chapters on you. They are the most stunning eulogy &amp; defence a poet ever
                    rec'd I do believe—260 pp—Have done for you what Ruskin did for
                    Turner." On <a href="loc.02899">July 10</a>, Kennedy spelled out the
                    contents of his seven chapters: "Enfans d'Adam," "Whitman's Title To Greatness,"
                    "The Style of Leaves of Grass," "Analytical Introduction To Leaves of Grass,"
                    "Democrat &amp; Comrade," "Passage To India," and "Walt Whitman and His
                    Friends," to be followed by an appendix, conclusion, and bibliography. Without
                    consulting Whitman, Kennedy had begun negotiations for publication. Frederick W.
                    Wilson, the Scottish publisher of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, was
                    not willing to undertake publication when he wrote to Kennedy on April 24, 1886,
                    because the trade "is so terribly depressed that all enterprise is knocked on
                    the head" (Trent Collection, Duke University). This manuscript was the first of
                    several drafts of what became two books, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt
                        Whitman</span> (1896) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of a Book for the
                        World</span> (1926). Part of the manuscript with Whitman's corrections is in
                    the Trent Collection, Duke University. For Whitman's conflicting opinions of
                    Kennedy's study, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in

                    introduction from Whitman to Dowden. Since Dowden always wrote sympathetically,
                    Whitman's remark is somewhat puzzling. On <a href="syr.00015">June 19</a>
                    Edward T. Potter sent an extract from Dowden's most recent reference to Whitman;
