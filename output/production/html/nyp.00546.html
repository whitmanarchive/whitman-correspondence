            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you a note of introduction to J A Symonds—whom I think most likely &amp;
                valuable, for the purpose you spoke of—(if I rightly understood
                it)—Symonds has leisure, has long been a reader of L of G.—&amp; I have
                heard has for some time been wanting to have something to say in print about
                it—If possible send him at first a copy of your complete book, in proof from
                the types, or type-written in slips, complete—In
                fact get two or three such copies, &amp; send me one in advance—No doubt I
                would see many important corrections to be made—or additions—or
                elisions—Maybe (though may-be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> too)—J A S
                would like the chance of giving his say, in such introduction—I dont think
                well of requesting any thing from Dowden—</p>
