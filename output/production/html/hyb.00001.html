                </span>

                <p class="tei_p">William O'Connor has returned, &amp; has brought me news from you all, &amp;
                    about Jeff's offer to go to St. Louis.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> I don't know what to advise
                    about it—but feel as if I was rather in favor of accepting the offer. Jeff
                    must take it cool, &amp; not get excited about it—&amp; after he has <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">decided</span> which to do, must go ahead for good, &amp; not
                    doubt his decision, or fear he has done wrong, &amp;c—I believe that's
                    about all I wish to say on it, at present. Wm. O'Connor was much pleased with
                    his visit, &amp; speaks about you &amp; all—he is a good fellow, &amp;
                    has been a good friend to me. </p>

                <p class="tei_p">Mother, I send you the Harper's Weekly, with the picture of Abraham Lincoln &amp;
                    the Drummer Boy<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a>—I think it is tip top—We are having warm weather
                    here—I am feeling very well indeed—I was down at the hospital
                    Sunday afternoon—the young man that had delirium tremens, that prayed so
                    long, has got quite well<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>—his
                    prayers seemed to be answered—at any rate, he is well &amp; gone back to
                    duty—while several others with the same complaint, are lying there not yet
                    recovered—One soldier, 12th Infantry, was dying while I was there—he had pneumonia—it was a very sudden &amp; dangerous attack, only taken
                    two or three days before—he had been in the war, &amp; had been wounded
                    badly—but sickness took him off at last—I sat by him about half an
                    hour—breathing was very oppressive indeed—It was a fine afternoon,
                    &amp; very still in the ward—&amp; off a block or so there is a big
                    Catholic church, St. Aloysius Church—they were ringing a chime of bells,
                    three or four bells playing a sort of tune, sounded loud &amp; joyful—I
                    sat and listened for a long while—the poor dying man kept looking at me
                    with such a look—</p>
