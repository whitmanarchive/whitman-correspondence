      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of Jan. 2<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> has just reached me here. I am always
        glad to get word from you. Write oftener. I have been very ill—now just a
        year—from paralysis &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cerebral anæmia</span>. I have been at
        death's door myself—&amp; during the year have lost my dear mother<a href="#n0705" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0705">3</a> &amp; a dear sister<a href="#n0707" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0707">4</a> by death. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I sent you a newspaper, with account, five months since, but as you do not allude to it I
        suppose you did not receive it. I send another by this mail. (I have sent you several papers
        &amp; magazines the past year.) I am not in bed but up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a little
        every day, &amp; shall probably get well again—But I remain paralyzed yet—walk
        with difficulty &amp; very little—have bad spells in my head—&amp; ameliorate
        very slowly—Still I write &amp; publish a little—Mental faculties not affected. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have at present no thought of visiting England.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> In a letter
        two years since Tennyson kindly invited me to come to his house<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a>—which aroused some thought &amp; wish for a time—but it has passed away. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">What have I heard about some great German University, proposing for one of its prizes, for
        some annual or bi-annual literary <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fête</span>, the question, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Has America really produced any real poet?</span> Have you heard any thing of
        such a discussion? </p>

      <p class="tei_p">What about Bjornson? Is he coming to America? If so, give him my address, &amp; tell him to
        come &amp; see me. (It is almost a part of Philadelphia, where I now live—on the
        opposite side of the Delaware river.) </p>

      <p class="tei_p">When you write, or send me (the Danish) Democratic Vistas, direct here. Write me from
        Germany,
        
                Walt Whitman
                431 Stevens street,
                Camden, N. Jersey.
                U. S. America
            
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">(I have not given up my place in the Solicitor's office, Washington—but keep up
        communication—&amp; if I get well, expect to go back there)—I want to hear all
        about Bjornson—</p>

                    introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in an 1872 essay in his magazine. He
                    wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
                    "I intend to write
                    an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
                    is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
                    liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
                    communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of

                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
