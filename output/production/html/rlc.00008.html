        <span class="tei_salute">My dear Rudolf Schmidt,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of Jan. 2 has just reached me here. I am always
        glad to get word from you. Write oftener. I have been very ill—now just a
        year—from paralysis &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cerebral anæmia</span>. I have been at
        death's door myself—&amp; during the year have lost my dear mother &amp; a dear sister by death. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I sent you a newspaper, with account, five months since, but as you do not allude to it I
        suppose you did not receive it. I send another by this mail. (I have sent you several papers
        &amp; magazines the past year.) I am not in bed but up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a little
        every day, &amp; shall probably get well again—But I remain paralyzed yet—walk
        with difficulty &amp; very little—have bad spells in my head—&amp; ameliorate
        very slowly—Still I write &amp; publish a little—Mental faculties not affected. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have at present no thought of visiting England. In a letter
        two years since Tennyson kindly invited me to come to his house—which aroused some thought &amp; wish for a time—but it has passed away. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">What have I heard about some great German University, proposing for one of its prizes, for
        some annual or bi-annual literary <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fête</span>, the question, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Has America really produced any real poet?</span> Have you heard any thing of
        such a discussion? </p>

      <p class="tei_p">What about Bjornson? Is he coming to America? If so, give him my address, &amp; tell him to
        come &amp; see me. (It is almost a part of Philadelphia, where I now live—on the
        opposite side of the Delaware river.) </p>

      <p class="tei_p">When you write, or send me (the Danish) Democratic Vistas, direct here. Write me from
        Germany,
        
                Walt Whitman
                431 Stevens street,
                Camden, N. Jersey.
                U. S. America
            
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">(I have not given up my place in the Solicitor's office, Washington—but keep up
        communication—&amp; if I get well, expect to go back there)—I want to hear all
        about Bjornson—</p>
