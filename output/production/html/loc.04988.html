             first rate—not particularly strong, but in good spirits and feel that things are 
             on the right track—that I am going to be O.K. again. I have had quite a spell of 
             it—been in bed and in my room since 10<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> say 17. 
                days—a long sick spell for me<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>—it 
                will last me (I hope) for a while—The 
             weather has turned cold and blustery but the place is looking well. My work has fallen 
             behind at the office (tho Beemer<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> has done first rate while I 
             was sick) shall have to pitch in now and catch up.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    of accidents and bouts with illness in the winter of 1890 and spring of 1891. He
                    dislocated his shoulder as the result of a fall in December 1890. See Bucke's
                    letter of December 25, 1890, to Whitman's biographer and literary executor
                    Horace Traubel, which is reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.175.html">Saturday, December 27, 1890</a>. In his <a href="loc.08134">April 13,
                        1891</a>, letter to Whitman, Bucke writes that his foot, which had been
                    sore for a couple of weeks, had become inflamed. He goes on to note that he was
                    "confined" in his room while his foot was "mending," and he also explains that
                    the "grip" he had suffered in late January seemed to have lingering symptoms
                    that he continued to experience. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07330_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07330_n2"><span>Dr. Nelson Henry (N. H.)
