            <p class="tei_p">Blessed be the fine bright sunshine! Here, after three
                days of cold darkness and rain, we have at last a clear warm day again; proving,
                that what we get of the delightful, can only be truly enjoyed after a pretty long
                taste of the disagreeable. Although the rain poured down plentifully enough, on
                Monday night, the great concert, under the direction of Mr. Strakosch,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> 
                came off according to announcement, at the Tabarnacle. Never, in New York, was
                such a performance; never, such an audience. The great area was illuminated by
                hundreds of wax-lights, in addition to the gas. Four thousand people, the tip-top of
                the city, crowded themselves upstairs and down. A band of eighty instruments, each
                of the first class of performance, rendered some of the choicest musical productions
                ever composed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The exhibition of the American Institute opened yesterday.
                Nobody there; it rained too hard. The articles are of the same old sort and variety.
                Hardly any thing new. Some of the Antiquarians hereabout are floating over a
                valuable MS. document, recently discovered, in Dutch, at the Hague, giving the
                earliest account of the New Netherlands. It has been sent hither to the New York
                Historical Society.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Irish Directory,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> (Messrs. O'Connor,
                Emmet,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> Greeley,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> J. W. White,
                T. Hayes,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> and M'Keon,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a>) have issued
                another manifesto to the American people in general and the Irish in particular, on
                the subject of the funds in their, the Directory's hands. They talk independently
                and bluntly. Their motives are commendable; but the day of their cause is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">past</span>. We had all better let the question go by default.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Macready<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> appears to-night as
                Macbeth, at the Astor Place Theatre. Hamblin,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">8</a> at the Bowery, is
                another goodly ruin of an actor, who <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">will</span> come forward and
                exhibit the mere shell of genius.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You remember the case of Korth,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">9</a> mentioned
                in a former letter, arrested for an attempt to murder Mrs. Behm,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">10</a> at
                the corner of Johnson and Adams streets, Brooklyn. The trial came on yesterday. The
                case seems to be clear enough; here is Mrs. B's testimony:</p>
            <span class="inline_quote">
                <span class="tei_floatingText">
                    
                        <p class="tei_p">"The prisoner often called at her husband's residence, and
                was on terms of friendship with him; on the evening of August 6, he called while she
                and her husband were at tea, and after some time said he would like a drink of
                water; her husband went to the pump, and while he was out Korth attacked her with a
                cane-sword and beat her with a whip until she was insensible."</p>
                    
                </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The Coroner testified that Mrs. Behm had three stabs on
                the neck and breast, besides cuts and stabs elsewhere, Mr. B. also swore to being
                attacked by North on returning from the pump, and so beaten and banged as to become
                insensible. Korth's counsel say that the blame of the attack lies on the other
                side.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The new naval officer, Mr. Bogardus,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">11</a> has
                made a clean sweep of all the Barnburners<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">12</a> in his establishment, and filled their
                places with Hunkers. Lawrence,<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">13</a> the Collector, still sticks out. Some
                more changes in the head officers here and elsewhere at the North, are every way
                likely before a fortnight elapses.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Immense numbers of immigrants continue to pour in by the
                Liverpool, Havre, and Bremen packets. Two thousand arrived, one day last week. Let
                them come and welcome—the more the better. Let them, however, not remain in
                cities, but post westward forthwith, and vote themselves farms.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Some of the Protectionists and Paper Moneyists here are
                trying to resuscitate a little of the old malignance against R. J. Walker,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">14</a> low Tariff, and the Independent Treasury. Few pay any attention to
                them, however; if they provoke public notice, so as to bring on a contest,
                "Protection" will very likely lose the ground it already retains. Walker will stand
                higher in the history of these times, than any other man of the present
                administration: he deserves to, too.</p>

                Under his management, New York City's Bowery Theatre became a successful venue for American working-class theatre. Hamblin occasionally booked opera
                and ballet events, but primarily produced melodramas, romances, farces, and circus acts that appealed to the working class Bowery B'hoy audiences
                of the Bowery district. In 1848, Hamblin bought the lease to the Park Theatre, which he renovated and reopened; however, the theatre was destroyed by fire
