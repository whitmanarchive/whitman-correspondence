            <p class="tei_p"> I have returned from New York had a pleasant visit, and took supper and breakfast
                with them—M John Alma May, Bertha Kitty Harold Calder and Albert, they all asked kindly after you and send their love,
                had supper in Brooklyn with Caleb Pink who is going to
                make his home in London Mrs Ingram was going over to see
                you today but was afraid to venture on account of so much rain, but I have been to
                the Prison in it all and had a talk to 2 poor Chinamen there, what a wretched system
                we have to treat our brothers worse than animals New York is the same only more so
                everyone seems to be striving to catch the biggest raft afloat on the uneven ocean,
                what a struggle to survive <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02361.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02361.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02361.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the stream what it all means I am at a loss to know or what it
                will lead to who is to say but it will be all right I suppose I have to take the
                next train home and send you these few lines in a hurry Mrs Ingram joins me in kind
