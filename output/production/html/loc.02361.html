                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).
