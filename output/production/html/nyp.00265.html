                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
                    York newspapers until he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army and Navy
                        Journal</span> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
                    he established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866. Financial control of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William
                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
                    Francis wrote for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> the unsigned piece
