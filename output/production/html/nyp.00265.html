            <p class="tei_p">The check for $60. arrived safely this morning. Please consider this a receipt
                for said sum.
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I received, some ten days since, the six proof-impressions of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Carol</span>—&amp; am much obliged. (No copies of magazine.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I forward herewith another poem for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>. If acceptable,
                please, after correcting, let me have a good proof in time.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The right of publishing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ethiopia Commenting</span>, in
                future book, is reserved to me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The price of the piece is $25.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have, in composition, an article, (prose,) of some length—the subject
                opportune—I shall probably name it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span>. It is
                partly provoked by, &amp; in some respects a rejoinder to, Carlyle's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Shooting Niagara</span>. I think it might be
                specially appropriate to your purposes &amp; scope. I would propose it to you for a
                leading article for January '68 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>. Please write me how
                the idea suits you. Or, as I am coming to Brooklyn in a few days, perhaps I may as
                well call personally, &amp; get your notions about it.</p>
