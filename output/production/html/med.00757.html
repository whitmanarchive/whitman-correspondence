                    with David McKay, his Philadelphia publisher, to print Bucke's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (1883). The poet personally supervised publication,
                    including proofreading. The typesetting of Bucke's biography was completed on
                    March 31 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
                    Bucke generated some of the text, but Whitman controlled every detail, altering
                    the proofs at will. On <a href="med.00703">March 20</a>, Bucke wrote: "I
                    open and read these parcels of proof in fear and trembling (you must go as easy
                    as you can, you are the terrible surgeon with the knife &amp; saw and saw the
                    patient). You left out my remarks on 'Children of Adam', I believe they were
                    good but I acquiesce—your additions are excellent as they have been all
                    through." On <a href="med.00709">May 28</a> Bucke was pleased with the
                    book he and Whitman had produced: "I believe it will do, and if it will the
                    Editor will deserve more credit than the Author—I am really surprised at
                    the tact and judgement you have displayed in putting my rough M. S. into shape
                    and I am more than satisfied with all you have done." Bucke, however, was not
                    quite so pleased with Whitman's high-handed treatment of his book as his letters
                    to the poet indicate. For in a letter on August 19 to O'Connor, who on August 16
                    objected to "several omissions and commissions," Bucke wrote: "I do not care to
                    go into these matters by letter but when you come [to Canada] I will make every
                    thing clear to your comprehension" (Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
