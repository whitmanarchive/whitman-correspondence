                    Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
                    movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
                    the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
                    1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Walt Whitman, had indicated her intent to "write to Mother." In that letter,
                    Mattie reported that Louisa had "promised" to visit her and the children in St.
                    Louis (see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of

                    Whitman's plan to visit his mother during his trip to Pittsburgh (see below).
                    Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie
                    and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867
                    to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see
