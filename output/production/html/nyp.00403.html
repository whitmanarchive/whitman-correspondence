                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Harry,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still stopping here,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> &amp; we are having quite nice times, all of us, (Mrs Gilchrist, Mr. Carpenter, Herbert and the two girls and I)—but I miss the creek, a good deal—yesterday, (Sunday) I thought if I could only go down to the creek, &amp; ramble about in the open air by myself &amp; have a leisurely wash &amp; some exercise, it would do me more good than any thing—but I staid in all day. Still it is all very pleasant here, every thing is so gentle &amp; smooth, &amp; yet they are all so jolly &amp; much laughing &amp; talking &amp; fun—we have first rate times, over our meals, we take our time over them, &amp; always something new to talk about. Mr Carpenter has travelled much in England, &amp; met many people &amp; he is one of a large family of brothers &amp; sisters, all in active life in various parts of the world, &amp; he shows us their pictures &amp; tells us about them—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Harry, not a day or night passes but I think of you—I dont suppose it would be so much fun for you here&#x97;but it suits an old man like me, (&amp; then it pleases one's vanity to be made so much of)—Harry, I suppose you get the papers I send you—I don't know whether you care about them, but I thought they might amuse you a moment there for a change—I want you always to take them home for your father—At present it is about 11½ o'clock—Herbert is down stairs painting—The girls are sewing—Mrs G is out shopping &amp; at the groceries—Mr Carpenter has gone upstairs to write some letters—&amp; I am sitting here in my front room in the great bay window at a big table writing this—a nice cool breeze blowing in—Why there it goes, the bell for 12 o'clock—right opposite us, the masons &amp;c building a big house, all knock off work, &amp; there are groups sitting down in shady places &amp; opening their dinner kettles—I too will knock off for this time—Dear son, how I wish you could come in now, even if but for an hour &amp; take off your coat, &amp; sit down on my lap—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Every thing about the same with us—was over to Camden yesterday afternoon—Mrs Gilchrist went over too, &amp; my brother took her out on a good drive about the country—My sister was up &amp; in good spirits<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—Herbert &amp; Mr Carpenter went out to the park &amp; didn't get back till 9—I came <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_miller tei_unclear_cert_medium">home</span> to Phil. by myself—The girls &amp; I had our supper together, &amp; had a jolly time—the younger daughter came out finely, &amp; she showed that she could make herself very agreeable &amp; interesting when she has a mind to—but the elder one is the noble one<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—the more I see of her the better I like her—</p>
                    
            <p class="tei_p">Harry, how are you getting along there? I suppose you are learning—&amp; I hope you are having good times<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—Something Mr Carpenter has told me about the effect working at telegraphing has on a person disturbs me a little—but I will talk with you more particularly about it when we are together again—I send you the enclosed from Mr C<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—I shall be down <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Friday</span><a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> in the 6 o'clock train—I want to see the creek again—&amp; I want to see you, my darling son, &amp; I can't wait any longer—</p>
