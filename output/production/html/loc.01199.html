                Shakspeare—and substitute Bacon; by no means a new idea, but still quite new,
                as I hold and dwell upon it. In the Sonnets I find <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the</span>
                clew to the mystery, and confirmation strong as words of holy writ of the truth, the
                grand, inspiring truth, of your own deep words. How beautifully you handle
                Tennyson—never so well, never aught like it that I have seen. The "In

                Bacon (as it may have required "Love and Death" combined to convict Tennyson) of the truth and

                some of us yet, however we come by them.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tenderness, benevolence, disinterestedness, sympathy, compassion:—Love is
                infinitely more. George Eliot knows that now. Mrs. Browning knew it while she dwelt
                in flesh. She, among women, and Bacon among men, they found their Christ and knew
                him crucified—that love, to become perfect, must needs be crucified. He, too,

            <p class="tei_p">Shakspeare? Wordsworth never felt that myth. He, like
                Mrs. Browning, felt (spite of all they knew, or imagined they knew) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">felt</span>, felt the reality—Bacon.—There is
                somewhat in the sexuality of marriage barring and dwarfing, however natural and necessary &amp;
                of course upon the whole, beneficent—Wordsworth and his sister, Renan and his,
                Charles Lamb and his, ay, Byron and his—these may be the better ideal of human
                friendship. For there is terror—desperation—in the love of one for the same
                sex.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Carlyle, like Wordsworth, had neither wit nor humor, nor the musical sense. (O
                    you have the last. I feel that! Has Emerson?) Albeit practiced
                    performers both, I do not find in either Browning or George Eliot the
                    musical sense of Mrs. Browning or even Charlotte Brontë. There are
                    deep-sea soundings of the musical <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">soul</span>, beyond
                    these ears. Carlyle not humorous, not witty? Sly, yes: and canny and superabundantly grotesque and ever wanting to be nobler than he was or could be. His
                    stomach was out of order. The sympathetic ganglia out of gear. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">That</span> ailed Carlyle.

                <p class="tei_p">Wordsworth felt Bacon. He did not feel—poet that he was—the myth Shakspeare, which so exasperated the critic's acumen in Pope and in Coleridge. Wordsworth
                    like Bacon was (or at least aimed to be) a Reformer of Poetry. To either, if
                    poetry had no <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">use</span>, to Wordsworth if it had not
                    divinest use, away with it. Why cumbereth it the ground? Wordsworth like
                    Bacon was patient, elaborate, methodical. He is <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="even​ ">e'en</span>​  content to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">plod</span> to his ends. And was not
                    Bacon? But the quick, fine, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">instinctive</span> ear for harmony was lacking in
                    Wordsworth. Bacon was all eye, all ear, all touch. Bacon was ever "mediating on that celestial harmony" he
                    felt all about him. Wit—humor—these,
                    moreover, were lacking in Wordsworth, and without them no modern poet can hope to
                    be a dramatic poet in any high sense. Had Wordsworth been the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">humanitarian</span> Bacon was, or approaching Bacon in this
                    respect, the French Revolution would have struck deeper chords in him than it
                    did; but the chords were not there to strike. Wordsworth was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nnk">selfy</span></span> as Milton was The
                    Puritanic leaven was
                    not quite out even of Wordsworth, which is so offensive in his friend Southey. Bacon, through his mother, was
                    certainly thus leavened—but the age of <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf004v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01199.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01199.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01199.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01199.008_large.jpg</span> licence and splendid pageantry and

                    reachd its grand climax crampd and sourd Milton making him 
                    austere and spiteful. Bacon was a "bashful" man. He
                    tells us so himself, and was "without arrogancy or overweening"; Most
                    devout, most Catholic, and at the same time (as Emerson says of Shakspeare, in touching upon the Sonnets—those
                    soul-and-body-tell-tale Sonnets, Mr. Whitman) "the most
                    susceptible of human beings". But do you recall Wordsworth's Preface to the
