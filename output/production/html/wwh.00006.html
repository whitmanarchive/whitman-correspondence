               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff must have got quite a long letter, (three sheets,) I wrote Thursday or Friday last<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—nothing particular. This is the fifth letter I have sent with shinplasters in—(Since George's $3 got lost I am more on the alert and mention them)—</p>    
            <p class="tei_p">The poor Frenchman d'Almeida<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>I told you about in my last, got out of the Old Capitol prison this morning—has been in a week—it was a most ridiculous thing putting him in—he was as square a man as I am—while he was in, the chief officer of the prison laughed sarcastically one day at his broken English, and d'Almeida said, "Sir you ought not to laugh—you ought much more to weep, to see a poor traveler like me in such a misfortune"—and Mr. Chief Officer immediately called the guard and sent d'Almeida to the guard-house for that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">awful offence</span> of making such an answer. The guard-house is a nasty, lousy dungeon without light—in it was a nigger with his wrists in manacles, and four white deserters—there is among the Old Capitol prisoners a little boy of seven years old—he and his father were taken as secesh guerillas in Virginia, and the government is holding on to the child, to exchange him for some Union prisoner south, in an exchange. Mother, my heart bleeds at all sorts of such damnable things of one kind or another I meet with every day—it is not the fault of the President—he would not harm any human being—nor of Seward<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> or Stanton<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—but the heartless mean-souled brutes that get in positions subordinate but where they can show themselves, and their damned airs and pomposity—they think nothing of treating a man like the worst slave-owner is supposed to treat his niggers—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Meanwhile the great officers of the government have every minute occupied with pressing business, and these wretches have full swing. It seems impossible that there could be in the Free States such tyrants, as many you see hereabout—This d'Almeida is a very modest man, a real French gentleman, poor, and quite distinguished as a traveler and man of science—and is a Professor in the Academy of France. He takes or appears to take his misfortunes very goodnaturedly—yet it must have cut pretty deep on some accounts, he suffered every humiliation.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, dearest mother, how does it go at home? I hope you are none of you going to move—I hope it is arranged that you shall stay—there would be something dissatisfactory wherever you should go. I was real glad to hear Jeff had abandoned the idea of building, this spring—to attempt it without money is winding onesself round and round in the devil's own net.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I saw Frederick Ellison here yesterday—he is a young man that used to be in Hughes's store there above Cumberland street<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—he is in the 9th N. Y. Militia—has just come from Brooklyn, where he has been on a furlough—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I would be glad to hear about Han—I must write to her very soon. I have not heard from George since. Yesterday I spent the day at Emory Hospital—a very needy place—I gave out a great many things, and about $4 in money—it was a good day. I was covered with mud, getting there. (I dont mean good <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">weather</span>, it rained hard)—</p>

            </span>
         
            
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff, I shall write a few lines soon to Mr. Rae—also to the firm that contributed the $10.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I have not yet rec'd the engravings.</p>

                    (1822–1880), a professor and author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Problèmes de
                        physique</span> (1862), came to the United States in 1862. In the Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection at the Library of Congress, there are three interesting
                    letters from d'Almeida to William Douglas O'Connor, a close friend and associate
                    of Whitman's. From Memphis, Tennessee, on January 28, 1863, d'Almeida explained
                    that because of the kindness of a Miss Rebecca Harding he had been introduced to
                        "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">la société rebelle</span>." On March 2, 1863, he asked
                    O'Connor to visit him in the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Washington National Republican</span> of this date listed
                    d'Almeida among refugees who were committed to Old Capitol Prison for
                    examination. From New York, on March 27(?), d'Almeida wrote his farewell letter
                    after he had been to Boston, where he had been entertained by James Fields, and
                    had met Longfellow, Emerson, and Agassiz: "I carry with me a little American
                    library in which the LEAVES of Grass are included." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_wwh.00006_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="wwh.00006_n3"><span>William Henry Seward

                    at 373 Myrtle Avenue. In 1861–1862, the Directory cited "house
                    furnishings," and in 1865–1866, "glass ware." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_wwh.00006_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="wwh.00006_n7"><span>On <a href="duk.00339">February 12, 1863</a>, Jeff sent to his brother $10

                    Hill, and Warren Hill were engineers; Simon Hill, Samuel Hill, and Thomas Newman
                    were contractors) and $5 "from our friend Mr. E. Rae": "I know Rae is a
                    liberal hearted man and through his friends he could do a great deal and I am
                    confident that he could be more earnestly interested in the matter if you write
                    him directly." This was probably E. H. Rae, a law copyist with an office at 16
                    Wall Street, New York. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
