            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent you a postal card yesterday that the bundle had come all right, 
                with the right things I wanted. My condition is still what may be called 
                favorable—that is I still keep up without having any of those decidedly 
                bad spells—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blurs</span> as I call them—of a while ago—&amp; in general I feel as 
                well &amp; as strong (such as it all was) as before I was taken 
                with those spells. I go out again a little.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete I told you about a young railroad man, Tom Osler, 26 years old, 
                that I met occasionally &amp; talked with, that had a felon on his hand—I took quite a fancy to him, &amp; he to me—Well, he is dead, killed instantly—(I have marked the piece in the paper already sent)—I went around yesterday 
                to where he lived, it is near here, he was married, leaves a young widow, 
                &amp; a nice little 2 year old boy—I saw them—his body, broken &amp; scalded, 
                lay in the front room—Whenever you have the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Star</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Republican</span> once 
                in a while you can send them (you can send 2 for a 1 <span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">ct</span> stamp) I dont
                mind their being a little old—I see the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Chronicle</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Capital</span> at the 
                reading room—I am feeling full as well as usual to-day, &amp; think of 
                going out &amp; across the ferry—it is so pleasant this afternoon</p></div>

                &amp; up to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, I have spoken of. Yesterday, 
                &amp; yesterday evening I felt better than usual—but am not so well to-day—the worst of my case is these <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fall backs</span>—But I have been out a little to-day. 
                My walking does not improve any at all. (Then to make things more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cheerful</span>, 
                there are many deaths hereabout from paralysis)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I quite miss poor Tom Osler. I am in the habit of sitting of the forenoon 
                by the first-floor window, reading the papers, &amp; Tom would often stop a few minutes 
                &amp; talk to me at the window, on his way to &amp; from the depot—He would never come 
                in the house, but seemed to like to stop &amp; talk that way with me. My boy<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> that had his eye hurt is doing rather badly too. About myself, my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">general strength</span> 
                not only holds out, but I think rather improves, which helps a good deal. 
                Your postal card came—also a letter from Eldridge, enclosing the key.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
