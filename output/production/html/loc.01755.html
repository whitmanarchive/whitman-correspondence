                <span class="tei_salute">Dear son,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent you a postal card yesterday that the bundle had come all right, 
                with the right things I wanted. My condition is still what may be called 
                favorable—that is I still keep up without having any of those decidedly 
                bad spells—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blurs</span> as I call them—of a while ago—&amp; in general I feel as 
                well &amp; as strong (such as it all was) as before I was taken 
                with those spells. I go out again a little.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete I told you about a young railroad man, Tom Osler, 26 years old, 
                that I met occasionally &amp; talked with, that had a felon on his hand—I took quite a fancy to him, &amp; he to me—Well, he is dead, killed instantly—(I have marked the piece in the paper already sent)—I went around yesterday 
                to where he lived, it is near here, he was married, leaves a young widow, 
                &amp; a nice little 2 year old boy—I saw them—his body, broken &amp; scalded, 
                lay in the front room—Whenever you have the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Star</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Republican</span> once 
                in a while you can send them (you can send 2 for a 1 <span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">ct</span> stamp) I dont
                mind their being a little old—I see the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Chronicle</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Capital</span> at the 
                reading room—I am feeling full as well as usual to-day, &amp; think of 
                going out &amp; across the ferry—it is so pleasant this afternoon</p></div>

            <span class="tei_dateline"><span class="tei_date"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Friday afternoon</span></span></span><p class="tei_p">—I went out yesterday afternoon—across to Philadelphia, 
                &amp; up to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, I have spoken of. Yesterday, 
                &amp; yesterday evening I felt better than usual—but am not so well to-day—the worst of my case is these <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fall backs</span>—But I have been out a little to-day. 
                My walking does not improve any at all. (Then to make things more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cheerful</span>, 
                there are many deaths hereabout from paralysis)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I quite miss poor Tom Osler. I am in the habit of sitting of the forenoon 
                by the first-floor window, reading the papers, &amp; Tom would often stop a few minutes 
                &amp; talk to me at the window, on his way to &amp; from the depot—He would never come 
                in the house, but seemed to like to stop &amp; talk that way with me. My boy that had his eye hurt is doing rather badly too. About myself, my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">general strength</span> 
                not only holds out, but I think rather improves, which helps a good deal. 
                Your postal card came—also a letter from Eldridge, enclosing the key.

            <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Good bye for this time, my loving boy.</span>
