            <p class="tei_p">What is now the status of the Rolleston translation, with reference to
                    publication? I have seen your letter of some weeks
                since to Dr Bucke—tell me of any thing new—or probabilities. I
                particularly hope it is intended to give the English text of the pieces, either on
                the left-hand page or running in smaller type at the bottom of every page &amp;
                forming one third—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you have some loose sheets (last proofs, or what not) of your new "Representative
                German Poems," send me three or four pages. (I dont want
                the book, but just want to see how it is made up, paged &amp; printed)—My
                health is about as usual, except a worse lameness—</p>
