            <p class="tei_p">I returned from Toronto (after attending, yesterday, Mrs O'Reilly's funeral) at noon today and find your long and interesting
                letter of Saturday and Sunday enclosing Mrs. O'Connor's most
                pathetic letter, to you, of 9<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>. Poor Mrs O'Connor is indeed alone, I fear the rest of her life will be terribly
                lonely. I am much pleased that you have actually been out in the chair and that you
                seemed to find it a success—I shall feel easier about you—you will not
                be so horribly dull now though you may still be dull enough. But to get out even a
                little while once or twice a day (in good weather) will undoubtedly break the
                monotony a little. It will be good for Ed, too, will give him
                something to do—some little exercise. I am glad to hear that you sweat freely

                weather has come. It is a capital thing for you and frequent baths with more or less
                massage each day will keep the skin acting and will be most beneficial to you. Do not be discouraged because you do not see good
                effects from such things (as baths, massage, getting out &amp;c &amp;c) at
                once—at your age reaction takes place slowly—but all these things will
                tell in the long run and I have good hopes that you may make a rally yet for you
                have a constitution of ten thousand. The letter containing the 1<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> prescription must have miscarried (I certainly sent it). I do not think
                very much of the dinner scheme  but all the same I should
                like to be there (have heard nothing abt. it except your letter). If there were
                some good speeches well reported it might not be amiss (I am a firm believer in all
                legitimate forms of advertizing). I should like to be there and make a speech myself
                all right enough</p>
