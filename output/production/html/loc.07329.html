            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 18, 20, 21 enclosing letters from Rhys and
                    Burroughs came to hand this afternoon and was
                welcomed as usual. I rather envy Rhys meeting Henry Harland—H.H. is a man I have considerable admiration of
                and I sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> like well to meet him. I am well pleased that you like your present
                nurse so well and hope he will stick to you and to
                the massage business which is the great thing for you. Eldridge
                (I suppose your old publisher of 1860—29 years ago!) must be a pretty old
                fellow to be getting married? But they say "there is no fool like an old fool!" He
                probably knows his own business best, any how! Is the "Harleigh Cemetery" which you
                mention that one which we used to pass driving out to the Staffords? If so it must be a pleasant place—well laid out
                and planted by now.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well Xmas is round again! I can hardly believe it. There is no time of the year I
                like to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">get over</span> so well as Xmas and New Years—thank
                goodness this week and next will fix them! I have some writing to do if I could only
                get at it but there is so much turning up all the time (all requiring to be looked
                after) that I almost despair of doing anything. Should the meter turn out O.K. I
                wonder if a poor devil would have more time or less? Well we must scratch along best
                we can while we are here. I wonder how it will be on our next stage? Shall we still
                have to toil and moil, work and fight as here? or will the Lord give us a rest?</p>
