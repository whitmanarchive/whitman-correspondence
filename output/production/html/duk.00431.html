                    <p class="tei_p">This letter dates to December 4–5, 1863. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                        began composing the letter on Friday evening, December 4, but she did not
                        complete it until the following morning or afternoon. Richard M. Bucke dated
                        this letter to December 5, 1863. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver dated

                    <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman had departed Brooklyn on December 3 (a Thursday) to return to
                        Washington. Louisa began composing the first part of this letter (numbered
                        "1") on December 4, 1863, and she conveyed to Walt a detailed account of the
                        "particulars of Andrews death," from Walt's departure through his brother's
                        decease. Andrew Jackson Whitman died on Thursday afternoon, his body was
                        brought to the Portland Avenue home on Thursday evening, and part one of
                        Louisa's letter—composed Friday evening and covering four
                        pages—closes with Andrew's body lying in his coffin on Friday
                        afternoon in the Portland Avenue house. Louisa proclaimed herself "composed
                        and ca[lm?]." The second part of the letter (numbered "2") was written later
                        that Friday evening or Saturday morning, and Louisa asked Walt to write to
                        Hannah Whitman Heyde (Walt's sister in Vermont) and informed Walt of Mrs.
                        Brown's kindness. Part two of the letter concludes. The fifth page is
                        divided into two sections by a line across the page, but the section below
                        the line does not follow immediately in reading order.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa resumed writing on Saturday morning or early afternoon after she
                        realized that Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman planned to inform Walt about
                        an episode from the night before, which she did not intend to include in her
                        letter. The night before, Jesse Whitman, Walt's brother, threatened to whip
                        Manahatta, Jeff and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's three-year-old
                        daughter. Mattie confronted Jesse, and Louisa eventually calmed Jesse down.
                        Louisa resumed her letter on page six (numbered part "3") with the intent to
                        offer her account for what she feared would be a more inflammatory account
                        were Jeff to write. According to Louisa, Jesse had called Mattie "very bad
                        names" and looked "very wild for a while." Louisa blamed Jesse's outburst on
                        seeing his brother Andrew's corpse. Jeff may have been temporarily assuaged
                        by having his mother inform Walt about Jesse's behavior, but both Jeff and
                        Mattie later sent Walt alternate accounts of Jesse's behavior. After
                        reaching the bottom of page six, Louisa turned the page and continued her
                        letter on the bottom quarter of the previous page (page 5), adding a line to
                        divide the page into two sections. Unable to complete the letter in the
                        available space, she then selected another sheet of paper and brought the
                        letter to a close on the seventh page. The part numbers are in Louisa's
                        hand, and they clarify the intended reading order of the letter. The
                        transcription is presented in order of composition and an implied order of
                        reading.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The letter's opening tone seems deliberately measured to manage unspeakable
                        sorrow and to elide Jesse's hellish outburst, from which Louisa would prefer
                        to spare Walt. Faced with Jeff's anger, she did her best to manage the
                        reshaping of the letter even as its physical layout begins to reveal her
                        mental and emotional strain.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00423_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00423_n3"><span>Andrew Jackson Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken

                    Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
                    treatment of Hannah. Walt Whitman said in his <a href="loc.00804">December

                    Whitman waited almost two weeks to write Walt Whitman, but he gave his account
                    of Jesse Whitman's violent outburst in his <a href="loc.00429">December 15,
                        1863</a> letter to Walt. Jeff's letter has essentially the same order of
                    events as Louisa's letter but provides harrowing detail. Manahatta, who was a
                    bit over three years old, set off her uncle Jesse by "shoving a chair slowly
                    toward the stove." Jesse threatened to "break her damn'd neck," and Jeff's wife
                    Mattie confronted Jesse and told him "not to dare to lay his hand on her." Jesse
                    then turned on Mattie: he threatened to "kill her," to "beat her brains out,"
                    and called her a "damed old bitch." See also Mattie's December 21, 1863 letter
                    to Walt for another account (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie:

                    two floors to her room. Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's debilitating

                    indeed. Walt is now in Washington, a volunteer nurse, going from hospital to
                    hospital, and doing good every minute of his life. We hear of him at the bedside
                    of the sick, the pallet of the wounded, the cot of the dying, and the
                    pestilential ward. He writes letters home for disabled men, bathes the feverish

                    and attends with fidelity and tact to the thousand and one necessities of those

                    Jesse Whitman's having seen Andrew's body "last night," which was Friday, Louisa
                    wrote this portion of her letter on Saturday, December 5. Therefore, "last
