                On Sunday afternoon Johnston, Greenhalgh &amp; I went to a shaded bank, where we sat amongst 
                the trees, overlooking the lake &amp; the sunlit country &amp; hills &amp; moors beyond. 
                I there talked informally for an hour or so about you &amp; more especially about your religious 
                teaching—reading extracts from L. of G.—Our seclusion, the marvellous beauty of the day
                &amp; of the widespread peaceful landscape, (entirely rural) the rustling of leaves in the breeze 
                &amp; the songs of birds—all contributed to our study &amp; talk, &amp; gave effect to your words.—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Johnston had to leave soon after tea—after which Dixon G. &amp; I went to a small wood 
                near here, where we sat, looking towards the sunset—the air balmy &amp; sweet, 
                the birds singing their evening concert &amp; a cuckoo calling near. I again led the talk—this time, 
                as befitted the hour &amp; scene, about your present condition, &amp; all that it implies—reading 
                some of your later poems. We thought of you with swelling hearts of tenderness, &amp; love, &amp; it 
                was agreed to send you some expression of our heartfelt love &amp; prayerful "God speed."</p>
