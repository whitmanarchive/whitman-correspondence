            <p class="tei_p">Painter and picture arrived in Hampstead a week ago last Friday without any
                misadventure. The Custom house offices in Liverpool gave me no trouble, and beyond
                paying heavily for overweight luggage from Liverpool to London I experienced no
                difficulty. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Before writing I wanted a few people to see the work. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">To begin with, Grace is surprised and pleased with it—the
                picture comes up closely to her recollection of you &amp; she thinks that your
                admirers will be interested and pleased with the portrait. On Sunday <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02195.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02195.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02195.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> i.e. the day
                before yesterday some dozen literary men &amp; women looked in. Miss Brooke for
                instance (author of "An Heir without a Heritage") thinks you look grand, and that the picture "emanates" a living personality,
                and that there is a peculiar light and glow about it at all, as though it was
                painted near sundown.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Bernard Shawe (a delightful Irishman who reviews books in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pall Mall</span> cleverly) it was rather
                dark—late in the afternoon when he arrived, he thought there was a joyous
                spirited look about its execution.—asked me if I was not pleased with it
                myself? </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mrs Arthur Wilson (a spirited socialist—"what a
                splendid old lion." In fact it is quite evident that the picture <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02195.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02195.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02195.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> gives people
                quite a new and vivid presentation of your personality here. Buxton Forman wouldn't hear of its being "commonplace" thought Bucke's remarks about it out of <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">a mist</span> i.e. to try &amp; give 'a youthful fire to the
                eyes.' </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Ernest Rhys took high-tea with us yesterday, he only saw
                it by lamp-light, but Rhys said it gave him a distinctly new, fresh and enlarged
                idea of your personality, &amp; that he was very glad to have seen it before
                starting for America. He intends to start in about 3 weeks time, and thinks that he
                will be in Camden about the middle of November. I have asked him to call on Talcott
                    Williams, perhaps you will give him a "leg up" among
                newspaper men? He is going out in a cargoe-boat, so <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02195.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02195.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02195.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I should fear that he will be
                pitched and rolled about a good deal.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a smooth passage across except the last two or three days when it was quite
                rough. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I look back upon my visit to the States with great pleasure—it is a lovely
                country—and I remember the jolly talks &amp; dinners that I've had at your
                house. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I find that your portrait is <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_medium">searchingly</span> carried through and that there is little more to do to
                it—except the hands.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Please give my very kind regards to Mrs. Davis &amp; With
                love to Walt. </p>

                <p class="tei_p">Rhys think this work shows more "resource" than anything I have done. I think so
                    too.</p>
