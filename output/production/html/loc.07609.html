                swear by")—still live on mutton-broth, Graham bread, coffee or tea,
                mainly—appetite fair—nights fair—no doctors, not one, now for two months—(is it
                a good sign?)—have taken a calomel powder three or four evn'gs ago, &amp; shall
                probably take another to-night—write for me plainly the proper calomel
                prescription—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a trifle stronger dose if you think proper</span>—&amp; send me in your next—(I

                ab't him—he, S, has written to Horace T. in answer to H T's to him, disavowing the
