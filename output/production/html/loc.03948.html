            <p class="tei_p">For years I have owed you a debt. I would not say it in any other way—so I am
                trying to get others to take from you just as largely. I am writing a paper for one
                of our Boston Clubs—and it is to be all about you—on your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves</span> of Grass. Of course it has all been better said,
                but I must have my chance just the same. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00350_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00350_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00350_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00350_large.jpg</span> I am defending your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Children of Adam</span>.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> All at once it occurs to me:

                differently. In a few years I may not defend them so vehemently. I had better ask
                him what I shall say." So—this letter goes to trouble you. I want more than I
                can tell, to go to you, to sit beside you and talk about death and life; I know how

                years of religious thought—and years of looking into the far future. You may
                not be able to write—but what can I do? Shall I go on and will you trust me to
                say that every line, if rightly read, will give help? </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt Whitman: For years I have wanted to write to you—but knew I had no

                    née Pearsons, was a socialite and active member of various reform movements
                    and women's clubs. She served as the President of the Home Club of East Boston
                    and was a member of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. She married
                    Ebenezer Spaulding, an Assistant Surgeon during the Civil War, and, later, a
                    homeopathic physician and surgeon who practiced in Boston. Ada Spaulding read
                    and admired Whitman's poetry, visited the poet, and wrote a number of letters to
                    him in his final years. For more on Spaulding, see Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="https://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol9/iss3/4/">Women's Letters to Walt

                    d'Adam" in the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, this
                    cluster of poems celebrating sexuality was called "Children of Adam" in 1867 and
                    thereafter. The poems, openly "singing the phallus" and the "mystic deliria,"
                    were too bold for their time and often led to trouble for Whitman. His
                    relationship with esteemed writer Ralph Waldo Emerson cooled after he refused
                    Emerson's advice in 1860 to drop the poems; in 1865, he lost his job in the
                    Department of the Interior in Washington D.C., for writing "indecent" poems; and
                    he had to withdraw the 1881 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span> from
                    publication in Boston when the Society for the Suppression of Vice found it
                    immoral. For more on "Children of Adam" and its reception, see James E. Miller,
