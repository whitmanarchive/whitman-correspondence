            <p class="tei_p">You are prolific in surprises these days! The Complete Whitman is a great
                surprise. It dwarfs everything else. That wonderful title page I look at &amp; look at,
                &amp; can't seem to get dovetailed into my mind. —it is so original—unique,
                &amp; full of speaking life.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a good time yesterday (an exciting warm dash here &amp; there) in Boston while
                getting the books to their respective destinations. Please don't mention the express <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="charge​ ">ch'g</span>​ . it was only—trifle &amp; I want you to let me pay it please. You will have
                heavy postage on so many others of yr 150. Have the other 450 McKay's imprint? I left Baxter's on his office
                table, &amp; he got it shortly, although I did not succeed in seeing him. Garland's I left with Baxter, having previously verified him
                (Garland) to be on the lookout. (He had a <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="column​ ">col.</span>​  &amp; ½ piece in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Herald</span> on single tax (Hen. Georgeism)

                of good hands. I afterwards took a long walk down to 191 Commonwealth Ave, but found

                catching disease or ailment. I was disappointed as I wanted to chat with her <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">abt</span>​  her visit to England.</p>

                fatally injured. It was the first bad accident I had ever witnessed (strange to
                say), &amp; it made me sick, haunted me all the evening &amp; night. I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="thought​ ">tho't</span>​  of you &amp; your hospital work, &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">realized</span> for the
