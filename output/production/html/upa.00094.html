                    Symphony Concert and a precious ½ hour for my soul being at my disposal I
                    feel a strong inner impulse to pour out here in the evening solitude, my heart
                    to you in a genuine heart-letter of affection, welling up out of the deeps you
                    long ago touched as no other ever did or can. Dear friend whom I have for so
                    long admired, do you not feel that all is well with you &amp; the great cause of
                    freedom for which you have laid down yr life? I do. I feel somehow that the

                    grand aspiration, right philosophy, &amp; the heart-beats of true liberty."
                    Kennedy went on to complain that he was "really ill with hard work—nerves

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
