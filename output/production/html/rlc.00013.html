        <span class="tei_salute">My dear Rudolf Schmidt,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of July 17, from near Wiemar has just reached me. I am still here in Camden,
        &amp; shall probably remain permanently. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I do not recover my
        health</span>—for over two months past have been worse than ever, but feel better to–day, as I write—(if it would only continue)—I have pretty much given up
        all prospect of going out again in the world, as an active worker—&amp; the best I
        look for is to keep up, by care &amp; moderation, &amp; have the use of my mind as so far,
        with the partial use of my physical powers, for whatever term of life I have yet to live. I
        still go out in the open air a little, talk, &amp; keep in good spirits. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just sent you a paper with a long piece in, that may give you more particulars about
          me. Write often as you can—your English I get the
        meaning of very well, &amp; I am quite lonesome here. (All the letters you have ever
        sent—&amp; papers, sheets, &amp;c—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have quite certainly reach'd
          me</span>—I have a large bundle of them.) </p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I write, I sit here by my open window—it is very pleasant, plenty of trees &amp;
        foliage, (though I live in a street, in a city) warm, but a slight rain, just now—I
        have been out, this forenoon, riding in a street car—&amp; to the printing office,
        where I am printing a little book, my War–Hospital <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda</span> of
        ten &amp; twelve years since. When finished I will send it to you. Also "Two Rivulets," you
        see mentioned in the paper. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your brief words about Wiemar, only made me want <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">more</span>. Every thing now going on about literature or authors, or subjects
        appertaining to them, in the Old World, (Denmark included of course,) is more interesting to
        me than you might suppose. I have been in hopes of hearing from Elster.
        I wonder if he got the letter &amp; papers I sent him—If any <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dane
          you know</span> is coming to America, (if convenient,) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">give him my address
          here in Camden</span>—(Philadelphia is on one side of the river Delaware, &amp; Camden
        immediately opposite on the other—ferries constantly running—I live near the
        river)—Good bye, my dear Rudolf Schmidt—write often as you can.
      </p>
