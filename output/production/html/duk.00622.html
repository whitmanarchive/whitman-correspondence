            dear walt i am glad you
            are improving although slowly
            it is tedious to stay in so long
            i know by experience
            i haven<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">t</span>
            been out except next door
            in ten weeks this street has been
            so full of ice and there is
            quite a quantity of snow in
            it yet but i shall try to go
            out soon i have been better
            of the rheumatism this winter
            untill a week or so ago i got
            quite lame in my knees so i
            could hardly get down
            stairs but i think i took cold
            going out to the privy getting
            my feet damp as the water
            stands in the path nearly all the
            time but every thing must
            be kept so scientific here
            i dont know sometimes how
            it is i hope there will never

            be any thing to annoy or
            disturb the manager i think
                sometims a person can be
            to particular Lou aint so nice
            about any thing but the appearance
            of the house that seems to be her
            hobby she has her girls come
            to see her quite often girls she
            used to work with they have
            to all be up here sometimes
            i dont feel like having them
            but there is no where else
            for them but in the kichen
            we had five here yesterday
            not all girls but 3 went away
            but one girl and her beau staid
            till 10 oclock)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">well walt i beleive that will
            doo for gossip) poor jeff i want
            to write to him to day but

            to see them but i dont know
            when i ever shall i dont
            think it would doo to invite
            them here to stay) i thought by
            hattys letter maybey they dident
            like their new home but your
            letter says you think they are
            satisfied hattie dident say they
                was dissattisfied but she said
            the last few weeks seemed like
            a dream to her
            of course no
            place can be like home to them
            poor matt it seems as if i
            can hardly realize she is
            gone as her picture hangs here
            and looks so much like
            life it brings the tears to my
            eyes but i seldom speak of 
            her i think walter dear you
            and me felt the loss more
            than any one else except
            her family of cours Jeff feels
            it more than any one else can
            but time will asswage in some
                measur if it wasent for that we
                couldent live throug our troub<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">les</span></p>
