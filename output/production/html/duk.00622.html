                    17, 1873. The letter bears no date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, aside
                    from her statement that she wrote on Monday. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
                    letter mid-March, and it is probably the letter that Edwin Haviland Miller dated
                    only to March 1873 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). A more exact date can
                    be determined from numerous contextual clues. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
                    received Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman's <a href="loc.00638">March 9,
                        1873</a> letter and echoed some of its language in this letter to Walt
                    Whitman. She had also received Walt's <a href="nyp.00315">March 13–14,
                        1873</a> letter). Mid-March 1873 is also consistent with Louisa Orr Haslam
                    Whitman's trip to Philadelphia, with George Washington Whitman's prospect of
                    Brooklyn work, and with his plan to start building a house on the lot at 431
                    Stevens Street. The only Monday that conforms to all of these contextual matters
                    is March 17, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position

                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"

                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
