                        R. Ritter, inscribed on the verso of a letter from Walt Whitman to Fanny
                        Ritter composed on February 7, 1880. At the top of her transcript Ritter
                        wrote: "Extracted the following, to give to a friend of mother's as an
                        autograph."</span>. 
                The transcription presented here is derived from  Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Ted Genoways (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004), 55.
