        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I will just write you a word (for I feel to.) I am feeling well enough to be hopeful—Whether it is because I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">am</span> hopeful—or whether the precursor of health yet, after all—tedious as it is a-coming—this deponent cannot swear—but we will think it the latter. 
        I have had a bad week since I wrote you—feel more comfortable to-day. Saw the doctor (Grier)
        day before yesterday—he made a careful ausculation of my heart—pronounced it all right there—(I have been suffering considerable pain &amp; oppression on left side)—He still thinks I will recover—says he is not disposed to recommend galvanism, (though the electric business is his specialty)—says he is sure the main trouble is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cerebral</span> anæmia—cure, great care, good surroundings, 
        time &amp; hygiene—arrives, in fact, at the same conclusions as Dr. Drinkard<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—(though an entirely different man from Dr. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Drinkard​ ">D.</span>​ , a great talker, &amp; very demonstrative)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, you needn't send the photos of my nieces back yet. Keep them a while yet.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, your last letter is very blue, mainly about political &amp; public degradation—Summer's death &amp; inferior men &amp;c. being rampant &amp;c—I look on all such states of things 
        exactly as I look on a cloudy &amp; evil state of weather, or a fog, or long sulk meteorological—it is a natural result of things, a growth of something deeper, has its uses, 
        &amp; will hasten to exhaust itself, &amp; yield to something better—</p>

        <p class="tei_p">Thanks for your letter of 20th—give my love to Mrs. Brownell—</p>
