            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">So you are back again—I heard that your folks had sent for you—How did
                you like New York &amp; your trip &amp; every thing? I got your letter &amp; was
                glad to get it—write to me again if you feel like it—I saw Bill Engle
                &amp; he told me they had sent for you, &amp; that Ed was up here in Camden in a
                store—(I have not seen Ed yet)—Van I send you a paper—read that
                story "the boy from Xenia"—it is very good—in fact there is lots of good
                reading in the little paper—I know you do not care much for reading, but I
                wish you would read more—read this paper I send any how</p>
            
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00022_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00022_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00022_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had a good deal of trouble in business lately, but I guess it is going to be
                all right—I am not altogether out of the woods, but near it surely—I
                keep about as usual in health—I got a paper from Herbert—one of his
                pictures has taken a big prize, a gold medal—(probably he has wrote your folks
                all about it though)—A big fire up here last night, the Narrow Gauge Engine
                House &amp; Depot, five engines burnt, bad luck—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Van, show this letter to your father and mother—my love to you, boy, &amp; to
                all the rest, every one—I want to come down before long—Ruth, have you
                got <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a chicken</span> ready? I will send you word—I dream'd night before last I was
                down by the old pond a long while—the old tulip tree was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">coverd​ </span><span class="tei_corr">covered​
        
      </span></span> with blossoms
                &amp; the bees humming—</p>
