            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your paper was received
                yesterday and was very much pleased with the
                Contents and also with your kindness in sending it.
                I saw in the paper the death of Mrs Johnson. I was
                very much surprised to see it and felt very sad about it
                although a stranger to me I never met one so lady
                like and pleasing as she was and made the remark
                several times what an entertaining hostess she was I thought
                she must have made your visit very pleasant for you
                while there. I am glad that your health is better
                than it has been. Our little Walter has been very sick
                since I saw you we were afraid we would lose him
                but is just well now all the rest are well, send
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">there​ </span></span> love to you hoping to see you soon.

                    Commonplace Book on September 2, 1878, Whitman wrote the following note: "Mrs
                    Sarah E Brown ?Bowen | Woodside L I | N Y | (infant little Walter)" (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.). It seems likely, however, considering Whitman's
                    uncertainty about the last name in this entry, that the sender of this letter
                    was the same Mrs. Walter Bownes who sent a letter to Whitman dated <a href="loc.05964">June 7, [1876?]</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
