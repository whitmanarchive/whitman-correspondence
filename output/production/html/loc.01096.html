                    heartily. To think that some words of mine brought a pleased smile upon the lips
                    of a great and good man, adds something priceless to the value of my life.</p> 
                <p class="tei_p">My article was hastily written and, though you do acknowledge my good intentions,
                    must seem very inadequate to you. But for years it has been my aim some day to
                    write an exhaustive essay worthy, as far as it may be in my power, of your work
                    and genius. Now your personal touch, if I may say so, has given me a new
                    impulse, and I am resolved to set to work at once. If life and strength lasts,
                    this pen of mine shall help to reveal you to the German people.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">When I wrote that paper for the "Deutsche Presse," I did not know of the
                    translation published at Zürich, of which you speak. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01096.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01096.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01096.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01096.003_large.jpg</span>But I got it since then and
                    brought it here with me. I came here, together with a medical man, Dr. Rehfeldt,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> my faithful
                    friend since our common school days, and we are staying in a retired spot which
                    belongs to the most picturesque in Northern Germany. The house is situated high
                    in a garden from which we overlook two deep, quiet lakes, surrounded by hills
                    clad with beach and pine forests. On our island between them clusters the hamlet
                    of Lagow, at the foot of an ancient castle. My friend has his wife and children
                    with him. Every evening when these my little favourites have gone to sleep, we
                    light the lamp under an old lime tree in the garden, and then we call you to
                    keep us company. The other night I translated to my friends pp. 5 to 11 from Mr.

                    Generally my friend reads the translation while I compare the English text. So
                    Messrs. Knortz<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">6</a> and Rolleston<a href="#n1027" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1027">7</a>
                    have found in us a rather critical public. In many places the rendering is
                    excellent, and faithfully mirrors the beauty and power of your thoughts,
                    eliciting warm praise from Rehfeldt and his lady. In not a few instances, however, we also
                    noticed mistakes which sometimes will make it hard to grasp your meaning, for
                    those who cannot read the original. No doubt you are aware that it is very
                    difficult to translate you; frequently the entire originality of your language
                    seems to defy its being moulded into different forms. I have often experienced
                    it in my own attempts at translating you; for I was never quite satisfied with
                    the result. In any case there is not, in the German translation, that grand
                    harmony by which the original <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01096.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01096.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01096.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01096.005_large.jpg</span>is distinguished, and it

                    poet is required, and I think that some day he will appear who will do justice
                    to you even in German. However, everything considered, it is a careful and
                    diligent book Messrs. Knortz and Rolleston have given us, and as pioneering work
                    it is most welcome.</p>

                    English novelist George Gissing, is one of my very best friends. I knew him from
                    my first coming to England, in 1878, and passed with him, in common studies and
                    aspirations, some rich and fruitful years of companionship and curious
                    Bohemianism, and our correspondence, since my coming back to Germany, was never
                    interrupted. I made him acquainted with your works, after my return from
                    America, and it is my own experience he has related in "Thyrza": his hero's

                <p class="tei_p">I spent two years in America, from 1881 to 1883, at Rugby, Tennessee, the English
                    colony of Thomas Hughes.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">10</a> My health had broken down from overwork, and making the
                    personal acquaintance of the author of "Tom Brown's School Days," I was induced
                    to join his settlement, since I urgently needed a change of air. The sea voyage
                    did me much good, and when I arrived at Rugby, I was well enough to help for a
                    month or two in nursing those English young fellows who, after coming out to
                    Tennessee, were most of them attacked by typhoid fever. A number died, and when
                    the others recovered I went into the wilderness. But though I acquired a hundred
                    acres of forest land, and got a good house erected there in a solitary and
                    romantic spot, all of which is still my property, my farming came to nothing, as
                    I longed to get back to my studies, as soon as I had got well again in the rough

                    forest life. Seven squatter's children came to me every morning with their
                    spelling-books, and I amused myself with teaching them the three R's, still snow
                    blocked the roads. Then I passed the winter in complete solitude, reading
                    Shakespeare and the ancient classics, with no companion save a fine collie dog I
                    had brought over with me from England. In the spring of 1882, the trustees of
                    the "Hughes Public Library" which, in honour of Tom Hughes, had been founded at
                    Rugby by the publishers of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, offered me the
                    post of librarian, and I accepted it for a year, during which time I had to
                    arrange and to catalogue the whole library.</p> 
                <p class="tei_p">Your works were not among the donations; but reading about you in the "Critic"
                    paper, I believe, which was regularly sent to the library, I ordered "Leaves of

                    in which hundreds and hundreds of books were new to me and attracted my
                    curiosity, I was not then in a position to enter very deeply into anything, but
                    rather tasted of everything, and I may say the seeds that fell into my heart
                    when first reading you, have grown to maturity only after my return to Europe
                    when I found time quietly to digest what I had hastily swallowed.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I did not want to stay in America, as I felt that my real work lay in Europe with
                    which I was most strongly connected by personal and intellectual ties. So in
                    June, 1883, I went back first to England, and, about a year after that, to
                    Germany. But before leaving, I spent a fortnight in New York, and there I
                    purchased "Specimen Days and Collect,"<a href="#n4121" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4121">11</a> so that your complete works, as far as
                    they were then published, accompanied me to Europe.</p>

In
                    1884 I wrote an English book, entitled "The French Prisoners",—the story
                    of a friendship between a German boy and a young French soldier. It was
                    published by Messrs. Macmillan &amp; Co., of London, and rather well received by
                    criticism. One of its chapters is headed by a motto from "Leaves of Grass",
                    orig.: "Beautiful thought, beautiful as the sky, that war and all its deeds of
                    carnage must in time for even be lost."<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">12</a> In the following year I published, at
                    Leipzig, a German translation of Montesquieu's "Lettres persanes,"<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">13</a> with
                    commentary and critical introduction. In the latter I have also mentioned
                    you.</p> 
                <p class="tei_p">But I may say I am still in the beginning of my literary career. After finishing
                    that translation, I devoted about three years to extensive studies, writing very

                    Collection, held by the Library of Congress. Whitman discussed the letter and
                    Bertz's article with Horace Traubel, remarking, "It is interesting to me to know
                    what they think of us way over there. It comes from Berlin, which is a center, I

                    also Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Abroad</span> (Syracuse:

                    Walter Grünzweig's "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects numerous
                    examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
                    readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
                    translation. A sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sonntagsblatt</span> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
                    for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
                    Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. </span></span> [<a href="#r0248">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01096_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01096_n4"><span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Thyrza</span> (1887), a novel by the English novelist George Gissing

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
