        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new with me—I am well—Mother, I feel as if I wanted to come on
        there &amp; pay you a little visit—and as I can probably get off for a few days, I
        shouldn't wonder if I come soon. I think as I am likely to come quite a good deal, I would
        like in future to pay Sister Lou $1 a day for what time I stop there—I should feel
        better satisfied &amp; come oftener. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is quite cold here. I am wearing my overcoat—You see, mother, I am likely to prove
        a true prophet about Greeley—He is not expected here at
        the White House next March. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I hope this will find you feeling comfortable—I will send you a line
        before I come—which will probably be within a week—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; to George and Lou—</span>
