      <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new with me—I am well—Mother, I feel as if I wanted to come on
        there &amp; pay you a little visit—and as I can probably get off for a few days, I
        shouldn't wonder if I come soon. I think as I am likely to come quite a good deal, I would
        like in future to pay Sister Lou $1 a day for what time I stop there—I should feel
        better satisfied &amp; come oftener. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is quite cold here. I am wearing my overcoat—You see, mother, I am likely to prove
        a true prophet about Greeley<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—He is not expected here at
        the White House next March. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I hope this will find you feeling comfortable—I will send you a line
        before I come—which will probably be within a week—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
