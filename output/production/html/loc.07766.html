            <p class="tei_p">Bad night ag'n—heavy tussel strangling spell (phlegm &amp;c) bet. 12 and
                1—&amp; more or less all night but fell asleep utterly worried &amp; tired out
                toward morning—must have had sleep of a couple of hours—A suspicion of
                better, very faint but palpable, this forenoon—ate all my breakfast (egg,
                toast, coffee &amp; dab of raspberry) for the first time in three weeks—&amp;
                have a slight glint of strength instead of the deadly weakness &amp; inertia of past
                month—head ache all the forenoon—rather pleasant day, sun out most of
                the time—anxious abt my Tuesday evn'g engagement 
                next, want much to carry it out—but very uncertain as I write—Y'rs of
                    8th rec'd last evn'g—have just sent off a
                    "Bruno" to Burroughs and
                    Stedman (at Horace's request) also to
                Edw'd Bertz Potsdam &amp; R P Smith
                London—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">5 p m—have had my supper—beef &amp; onion stew to which in moderation I
                have seriously inclined—have just had to deny myself to a bevy of
                visitors—y'rs of even'g 9th just
                rec'd—thanks—have not had any doctor in yet &amp; probably will
                not—what I have is mainly an expansion &amp; perhaps concentration of my long
                long chronic botherations, bad enough before &amp; when <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this</span>
                is off, I sh'l feel sort o' well—how long the light day is getting—the
                sun is well up here yet—</p>
