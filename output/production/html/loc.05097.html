                rigid literality, to the utmost extent reconcilable with making any representative

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Grashalme: Gedichte</span> [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of

                    later in Germany and was the author of a version of Homer's Odyssey in English
