                    (1840–1909) served in the American Civil War, achieving the rank of Captain before being wounded and resigning from military service. McIlvaine 
                    went on to become an author, as well as a mycologist. He published the book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Toadstools, Mushrooms, Fungi Edible and Poisonous: One 
                        Thousand American Fungi</span> (1900), a standard work on mycology in his time and later regarded as a classic work in the field. McIlvaine published 
                    literature for young people, contributed fiction and poems to numerous publications, and often used the pseudonym "Tobe Hodge" for these publications. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03101_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03101_n2"><span>The Austrian cartoonist

                    letter. This suggests that the letter may date to 1890. McIlvaine continued

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                        <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
                    Phyllis Theroux, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Book of Eulogies</span> [New York: Simon
