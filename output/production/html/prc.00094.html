         <p class="tei_p">In answer to your note I send enclosed a copy of my poem for Tuft's College on the
            17th—which you are at liberty to publish on the 18th.
            I am not well enough to journey to College Hill, but have sent the piece &amp; requested
            that it be read in its place on the programme, 17th, exactly the same as though I were
            present—which doubtless will be done.</p>
