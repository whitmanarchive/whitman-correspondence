            <p class="tei_p">I got the Camden paper this morning containing the notice of your mothers death. I
                had heard through Eldridge a few days ago that all was over with her. I suppose it
                was not unexpected to you yet for all that the blow must have been a heavy one to
                all her children and doubly so to yourself. I should like to hear from you the
                particulars of her last days. I wish I might have seen her again. If you are able to

                should be delighted. I am going out on L. I. to look at a place for sale, Yaphank

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
                    see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
