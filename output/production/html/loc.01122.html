            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got the Camden paper this morning containing the notice of your mothers death. I
                had heard through Eldridge a few days ago that all was over with her. I suppose it
                was not unexpected to you yet for all that the blow must have been a heavy one to
                all her children and doubly so to yourself. I should like to hear from you the
                particulars of her last days. I wish I might have seen her again. If you are able to
                write <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01122.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01122.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01122.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> do drop me a
                line &amp; tell me about yourself &amp; what your plans are for the summer. I hope
                you do not think of returning to W. before fall. I go to N. Y. to-morrow for a few
                days. While there a letter addressed to me care of George Bliss Jr. W. S. Atty,
                41 Chambers St. will reach me. If you can come North &amp; spend some time with me I
                should be delighted. I am going out on L. I. to look at a place for sale, Yaphank
                on Carmans River. Do you know the country out there?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My nephew, Chancy B. is with me for a few days but leaves to-morrow; so does Sulic
                for Kingston.
