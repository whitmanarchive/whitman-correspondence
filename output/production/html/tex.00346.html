        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote to you three [or] four days ago, by which you must have recd partial list. The list on the other sheet will more fully show you what books I
        have sent, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">comprising I believe all the names &amp; remitting subscribers
          you have sent me</span>—Your two (principal) remittances £28.4 (April 19) and £45.9.6.
        (June 20) were accompanied with lists of subscribers' am'ts &amp; addresses—the names on which lists &amp; addresses I have carefully
        followed &amp; sent to. I hope &amp; think I have not missed any. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">If you
          discover or know of any so missed, pray notify me at once</span>. </p>

      <div class="tei_p p">Looking over the pretty voluminous correspondence &amp; extracts you have sent me so
        kindly, the last six months, there appear to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a number of other
          names</span>, both men's &amp; women's, mentioned, or writing themselves, as ordering the
        books in letters to you. But of course <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I have exclusively confined myself
          to the names &amp; addresses specified in the lists accompanying your
          remittance–letters</span>, above alluded to. I have been somewhat exercised about
        those <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">other names</span>. <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">Prof Atkinson</li><li class="tei_item">" Armstrong</li><li class="tei_item">A G B</li><li class="tei_item">G L Cathcart</li><li class="tei_item">Mrs. Deschamps</li><li class="tei_item">J D</li><li class="tei_item">Lady Hardy</li><li class="tei_item">Harold Littledale</li><li class="tei_item">C W S</li><li class="tei_item">Dr Todhunter</li></ul> ☞ Nothing has been sent to any of these <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">(D G Rossetti</li><li class="tei_item">C A Howell</li><li class="tei_item">J T Nettleship for self &amp; others</li><li class="tei_item">H G Dakyns</li><li class="tei_item">Herbert Herkomer</li><li class="tei_item">Roden Noel</li><li class="tei_item">A C Swinburne</li><li class="tei_item">G W Foote</li><li class="tei_item">Cicely Marston</li><li class="tei_item">&amp; several others</li></ul>—but know no other course than to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">confine myself to sending
          to the addresses on your remittance lists only</span>—which I have done. Any errors or
        oversights will be gladly &amp; promptly corrected on information. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I have
          now plenty of Books, &amp; orders will be complied with promptly</span>. The delay of the
        last two months in getting ready my second instalment of the 1876 Edition, has annoyed me
        much—but it is past—&amp; I have as I believe forwarded now every British paid
        subscriber his or her books, (duplicate sets are yet to go to three or four)—A parcel
        of 17 Vols. has gone by Express to Robt Buchanan to subscribers, sent through him to me—Prof. Dowden's 4 sets specified in your list have been sent to his
        subscribers to their addresses, &amp; Mr. Conway's 3 sets (ordered in his letter to me) to
          theirs—It is now some weeks since I have heard from
        you. I want to hear about Mrs. Gilchrist.
