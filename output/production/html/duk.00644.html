            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I got both your letters last week, &amp; they were a relief to my mind—I want to hear whether sis got over swallowing the penny
—don't forget to write about it—It has been cold &amp; disagreeable here, and another snow storm—but the sun shone all day yesterday—it keeps pretty backward here.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I went down to the Hospital Sunday—that young man Kephart was sitting up by the stove—he looked very pale &amp; thin, but is doing far better than I anticipated.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have written a letter to Han 
—I have received a letter from Mrs. Price
                
—they have most all of them been sick this winter—I see quite a good many notices of Dr. Ruggles' death in the papers—I enclose one printed in the paper here—taken from N. Y. Post—there is quite a long one in the Round Table, of March 16.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Every thing is exactly the same in the office, &amp; with me—Ashton has returned from Philadelphia—he tells me, confidentially, that he has decided to resign, early this summer—I am sorry to hear it—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope George will have good luck with the houses—he must take things cool—don't fail to write to me how every thing goes—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I believe that is all, for this time, dear mother.</p>
