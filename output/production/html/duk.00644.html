            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I got both your letters last week, &amp; they were a relief to my mind—I want to hear whether sis got over swallowing the penny<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
—don't forget to write about it—It has been cold &amp; disagreeable here, and another snow storm—but the sun shone all day yesterday—it keeps pretty backward here.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I went down to the Hospital Sunday—that young man Kephart<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> was sitting up by the stove—he looked very pale &amp; thin, but is doing far better than I anticipated.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have written a letter to Han 
—I have received a letter from Mrs. Price
                
—they have most all of them been sick this winter—I see quite a good many notices of Dr. Ruggles' death in the papers—I enclose one printed in the paper here—taken from N. Y. Post—there is quite a long one in the Round Table, of March 16.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Every thing is exactly the same in the office, &amp; with me—Ashton<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> has returned from Philadelphia—he tells me, confidentially, that he has decided to resign, early this summer—I am sorry to hear it—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope George will have good luck with the houses<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—he must take things cool—don't fail to write to me how every thing goes—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I believe that is all, for this time, dear mother.</p>

                    Whitman added: "last evening sis swallowed a penny, Jeff was very much alarmed

                    <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman first wrote of Andrew J. Kephart in his <a href="nyp.00258">February 26, 1867</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Kephart
                        was a soldier from Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, admitted from the 44th
                        Regiment Infantry for bleeding at the lungs.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Whitman also wrote about Kephart's recovery in his <a href="nyp.00260">March 5, 1867</a> and <a href="nyp.00261">March 12, 1867</a>
                        letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, and at the time of the poet's <a href="nyp.00262">April 2, 1867</a> letter, Kephart had "quite

                    <p class="tei_p">The Brooklyn physician Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the
                        Whitman family and became especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life,
                        Ruggles lost interest in his practice and devoted himself to painting
                        cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems."</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Obituaries appeared in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening Post</span>,
                        March 11, 1867, and in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Round Table</span>, 5 (1867),
                        173. The author of the obituary in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, on March 12, 1867, lamented the fact that Ruggles had
                        abandoned his profession to produce "Ruggles Gems": "The public gained
                        nothing by the change, and we regret Dr. Ruggles' death, not because we have
                        lost an artist, but because an excellent man and a worthy citizen has gone
                        to his rest." Jeff and Martha attended the funeral, according to Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman's letter of <a href="duk.00476">March 15,
                    1867</a>.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00644_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00644_n4"><span>J. Hubley Ashton, the
