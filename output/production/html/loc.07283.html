            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 16<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> &amp; 17 just to hand, also the parcel
                (Revue Independante, Critic, &amp; Palermo papers). The Critic don't seem to have
                much in it, the Italian papers I am sorry to say I
                cannot read (but glad to have them all the same for my collection), in the "R. Ind."
                there is just 8 pp. translation (Faces, Locomotive in Winter, A World below the
                brine) no comment at all, translation not good (translator did not fully understand
                the english text). It is funny he did not claim to
                translate from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">English</span> but from the "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">American</span>." The bundle is all welcome. As to your letter,
                dear Walt, I cannot say how it grieves me that you have had to suffer so much, nor
                how rejoiced I am that you can say you are "decidedly better"—I pray earnestly
                that you may keep on the mend now and <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00529.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00529.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00529.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> have at least a good respite and rest; I wish I could get away to
                see you and stay a little with you—but you have good doctors and I am glad to
                think, a good nurse. You have also a wonderful constitution and I have great hopes
                you will make a good rally yet and be with us for many a good day and talk. I had a
                line from O'Connor (sending me on your letter) he said he had been bad but "am now better" which I was
                glad enough to hear. Willy Gurd not here yet—untill he
                comes I have no idea when I can get away East about the meter business, and even
                after he comes I shall probably know very little more about it for awhile for he
                seems to have no ideas of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">time</span> at all and his days are
                weeks and his months years.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are having a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mean</span> winter so far, mud (soft &amp;
                sometimes frozen in to spikes and lumps) dirty snow, bad wheeling, no
                sleighing—but we all keep well. Love to you as always</p>
