                    20, 1870. The date July 20 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
                    date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New
                    York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The year 1870 is consistent with
                    the injury to and infection of Walt Whitman's thumb, and Louisa's remarks on
                    political concerns about the widening of the Franco-Prussian War and on a
                    Brooklyn heat wave also are consistent with the year. </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Brotherhood) founded in Dublin by James Stephens. Both organizations were
                    dedicated to the cause of an independent Irish Republic (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ireland and the Americas</span>, ed. James P. Byrne, Philip Coleman, and

                    Whitman paired the term "fenians" with "roughfs," she probably used the
