            <p class="tei_p">I still keep around &amp; have been over to Philadelphia this afternoon for three
                hours, the day has been so fine &amp; bright, (but I am weak &amp; half-sick
                yet)—over in Phila: I ride in the new Market st. coaches, the <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">Herdies</span> (they start from the
                ferry door, &amp; I buy 25 tickets for a dollar)—I was on Arch and Chestnut
                streets—such crowds—oceans of women, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">drest​ </span><span class="tei_corr">dressed​

                can think of, &amp; many you never thought of—always something new &amp;
                interesting—then I have a friend cor: 7th &amp; Chestnut, Col: Forney's office, a nice big old fashioned
                room—he keeps a great <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ratan​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Ratan​
        
      </span></span> easy chair for me, by a bay-window, &amp; I always stop there to rest,
                &amp; read the news—How are you all getting along?—We are at the beginning of
                another spring, &amp; I want to come down soon—The chicken was first
                rate—it made me several good meals—(I expected to pay for it, &amp;
                expect to yet)—the strawberries good—they tasted like Glendale—as
                I close it is 9 oclock &amp; a lot of darkies are going along singing an old
                southern slave hymn</p>
