                streets—such crowds—oceans of women, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">drest​ </span></span> to kill—I like to walk along &amp; look in the windows, every kind

                room—he keeps a great <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ratan​ </span></span> easy chair for me, by a bay-window, &amp; I always stop there to rest,
                &amp; read the news—How are you all getting along?—We are at the beginning of
                another spring, &amp; I want to come down soon—The chicken was first
                rate—it made me several good meals—(I expected to pay for it, &amp;
                expect to yet)—the strawberries good—they tasted like Glendale—as
                I close it is 9 oclock &amp; a lot of darkies are going along singing an old
                southern slave hymn</p>
