            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is after much hesitation that I venture at last to write these few words. Indeed
                for mine own sake I would not trouble you at all, but "The love of comrades" prompts
                me to do it cheerfully and willingly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Being a humble though ardent lover of the "Good Grey Poet"
                I was of course present to hear Mr Ingersoll's lecture in
                the Horticultural Hall, Philad<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a</span>.
                Writing to a fellow admirer of Leaves of Grass, in England I described as best I
                could the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03729.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03729.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03729.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> visit
                and the lecture, the gaining of an object which we had both long wished for—a
                sight of the Hero whom we jointly worshipped.</p> 

            <p class="tei_p">Sometime after this when the lecture was printed my friend saw a copy and read it
                himself with much pleasure. The words, "Wreath the living brows," which act as a
                sort of keynote to the whole, gave the inspiration for the few well-wrought stanzas
                enclosed herewith. These he forwarded to me, asking if I would send them to him for
                whom they were written. And so I send them fully believing in their deep sincerity.
                In my humble opinion they would serve excellently as a heading to Mr Ingersoll's
                lecture:—</p>
