            <p class="tei_p">It is after much hesitation that I venture at last to write these few words. Indeed
                for mine own sake I would not trouble you at all, but "The love of comrades" prompts
                me to do it cheerfully and willingly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Being a humble though ardent lover of the "Good Grey Poet"
                I was of course present to hear Mr Ingersoll's<a href="#n0839" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0839">1</a> lecture in

                and the lecture, the gaining of an object which we had both long wished for—a
                sight of the Hero whom we jointly worshipped.</p> 

            <p class="tei_p">Sometime after this when the lecture was printed my friend saw a copy and read it
                himself with much pleasure. The words, "Wreath the living brows," which act as a
                sort of keynote to the whole, gave the inspiration for the few well-wrought stanzas
                enclosed herewith. These he forwarded to me, asking if I would send them to him for
                whom they were written. And so I send them fully believing in their deep sincerity.
                In my humble opinion they would serve excellently as a heading to Mr Ingersoll's
                lecture:—</p>

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                lecture in Whitman's honor that took place on October 21, 1890, at Philadelphia's

                physician Richard Maurice Bucke planned the event, and the orator and agnostic
