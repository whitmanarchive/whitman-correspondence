            <p class="tei_p">All quiet here and another perfect autumn day. Your card of 13th came this morning. I
                think it is wonderful how perfect your handwriting keeps through all your illness
                and feebleness. No I would not recommend Froude's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
                    Carlyle<a href="#n4301" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4301">3</a> to a man who needed cheering up. I read it a few
                years ago and it nearly gave me an attack of melancholia. I look upon that same
                Carlyle as being (or having been?) one of the worst "cranks" that ever lived. And he
                certainly had about as bad a time of it <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00369.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00369.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00369.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_es.00369.jpg</span> for 86 years as any man ever had in this
                world. Nothing gave him pleasure, nearly everything gave him pain. As long as his
                wife lived her presence only seemed to add to his worry and gloom; as soon as she
                was dead he was more gloomy and worried more than ever because he had lost her! He
                was a bad sample and she was little (if any?) better. He couldn't even live with his
                favorite brother John! I think his ignorant old mother with her pipe was the best of the lot;
                think I could have liked her—I shall like to know C. by &amp; by to see what
                he is like in the next world but I never expect to care much about him!</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    literary executor to Scottish writer Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881), after
                    whose death Froude published a biography entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Life of
                        Carlyle</span>, which described Carlyle's intellectual accomplishments as well
                    as his personal failings, in particular his unhappy relationship with his wife,
                    Jane Welsh. Froude had previously published Jane's writings in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Letters and Memorials of Jane Welsh Carlyle</span> in 1883 to much protest
                    from Carlyle's surviving family, and his biography of Carlyle emphasized his
                    conflicted marriage for contemporary readers. For more on Froude, see
