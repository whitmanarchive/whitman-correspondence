                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Conway,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of February 1st has just come to hand. I am willing that Mr. Hotten
                should sell his English publication of my Poems in the United States, on condition
                of paying me one shilling on every copy disposed of here—&amp; hereby give
                consent to that arrangement.
                Furthermore, to save trouble, I hereby fully empower you to decide &amp; act for me
                in any matters or propositions relating to the book, in England, should any such
                arise—&amp; what you agree to is agreed to by me. If convenient I should like
                Mr. Hotten to send me two copies of the book, by mail, immediately. I should also
                consider it a special favor if you would forward me from time to time any of the
                English magazines or journals that might contain <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">noteworthy</span>
                criticisms of my poems. But you must allow me to repay you the favor.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William O'Connor is well, and remains employed as before. Ellen O'Connor is
                absent in Providence, but returns soon—their little daughter has been very
                ill, but is now convalescing.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Our American politics, as you notice, are in an unusually effervescent
                condition—with perhaps (to the mere eye-observation from a distance) divers
                alarming &amp; deadly portending shows &amp; signals. Yet we old stagers take things
                very coolly, &amp; count on coming out all right in due time. The Republicans have
                exploited the negro too intensely, &amp; there comes a reaction. But that is going
                to be provided for. According to present appearances the good, worthy,
                non-demonstrative, average-representing Grant will be chosen President next fall.
                What about him, then? As at present advised, I shall vote for him non-demonstrative
                as he is—but admit I can tell much better about him some five years hence.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I remain well &amp; hearty—occupy the same quite agreeable &amp; quiet berth in
                the Attorney General's office—and, at leisure, am writing a prose piece or
                two, (which I will send you, when printed.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I wish to send my sincerest thanks &amp; personal regards to Mr. Rossetti. To have
                had my book, &amp; my cause, fall into his hands, in London, in the way they have, I
                consider one of the greatest pieces of good fortune.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Morley called upon me. Did you get my piece I sent, "Democracy"? I have just
                received a letter from A. B. Alcott—he was with Mr. Emerson the previous evening, talking. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Remember my request to Mr. Hotten for a couple of copies by mail—also, by your
                own kindness, any English criticisms of value should such appear.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have not yet seen the February Fortnightly—nor the book William Blake—but shall procure &amp; read both. I
                feel prepared in advance to render my cordial &amp; admirant respect to Mr.
                Swinburne—&amp; would be glad to have him know that I thank him heartily for
                the mention which, I understand, he has made of me in the Blake.
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Indeed, my dear friend, I may here confess to you that to be accepted by those young
                men of England, &amp; so treated with highest courtesy &amp; even honor, touches one
                deeply. In my own country, so far, from the organs, the press, &amp; from
                authoritative sources, I have received but one long tirade of shallow impudence,
                mockery, &amp; scurrilous jeers. Only since the English recognition have the skies
                here lighted up a little.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">With remembrance &amp; love to you, Rossetti, &amp; all my good friends—I
                write, for the present, Farewell. </p>
