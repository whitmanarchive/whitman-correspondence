                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Conway,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of February 1st has just come to hand. I am willing that Mr. Hotten
                should sell his English publication of my Poems in the United States, on condition
                of paying me one shilling on every copy disposed of here—&amp; hereby give
                consent to that arrangement.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
                Furthermore, to save trouble, I hereby fully empower you to decide &amp; act for me
                in any matters or propositions relating to the book, in England, should any such
                arise—&amp; what you agree to is agreed to by me. If convenient I should like
                Mr. Hotten to send me two copies of the book, by mail, immediately. I should also
                consider it a special favor if you would forward me from time to time any of the
                English magazines or journals that might contain <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">noteworthy</span>
                criticisms of my poems. But you must allow me to repay you the favor.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William O'Connor is well, and remains employed as before. Ellen O'Connor<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is
                absent in Providence, but returns soon—their little daughter has been very
                ill, but is now convalescing.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Our American politics, as you notice, are in an unusually effervescent
                condition—with perhaps (to the mere eye-observation from a distance) divers
                alarming &amp; deadly portending shows &amp; signals. Yet we old stagers take things
                very coolly, &amp; count on coming out all right in due time. The Republicans have
                exploited the negro too intensely, &amp; there comes a reaction. But that is going
                to be provided for. According to present appearances the good, worthy,
                non-demonstrative, average-representing Grant will be chosen President next fall.
                What about him, then? As at present advised, I shall vote for him non-demonstrative
                as he is—but admit I can tell much better about him some five years hence.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I remain well &amp; hearty—occupy the same quite agreeable &amp; quiet berth in
                the Attorney General's office—and, at leisure, am writing a prose piece or
                two, (which I will send you, when printed.)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">I wish to send my sincerest thanks &amp; personal regards to Mr. Rossetti. To have
                had my book, &amp; my cause, fall into his hands, in London, in the way they have, I
                consider one of the greatest pieces of good fortune.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Morley<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> called upon me. Did you get my piece I sent, "Democracy"? I have just
                received a letter from A. B. Alcott<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—he was with Mr. Emerson the previous evening, talking. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Remember my request to Mr. Hotten for a couple of copies by mail—also, by your
                own kindness, any English criticisms of value should such appear.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have not yet seen the February Fortnightly<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—nor the book William Blake—but shall procure &amp; read both. I
                feel prepared in advance to render my cordial &amp; admirant respect to Mr.
                Swinburne—&amp; would be glad to have him know that I thank him heartily for
                the mention which, I understand, he has made of me in the Blake.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Indeed, my dear friend, I may here confess to you that to be accepted by those young
                men of England, &amp; so treated with highest courtesy &amp; even honor, touches one
                deeply. In my own country, so far, from the organs, the press, &amp; from
                authoritative sources, I have received but one long tirade of shallow impudence,
                mockery, &amp; scurrilous jeers. Only since the English recognition have the skies
                here lighted up a little.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">With remembrance &amp; love to you, Rossetti, &amp; all my good friends—I
                write, for the present, Farewell. </p>

                        He had visited Walt Whitman in February; see Morley's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Recollections</span> (1917), 2:105. Morley replied on <a href="loc.01810">January 5, 1869</a> that he could not print Walt
                        Whitman's poem ("Thou vast Rondure, Swimming in Space") until April: "If
                        that be not too late for you, and if you can make suitable arrangements for
                        publication in the United States so as not to interfere with us in point of
                        time, I shall be very glad." Unaccountably, the poem did not appear in

                    Endlessly Rocking" and "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he
                    termed "the most sweet and sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the
                    world" ([London: John Camden Hotten, 1868], 300–303). Included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs before Sunrise</span> (1871) was his famous lyric "To Walt
