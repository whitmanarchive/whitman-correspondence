            and wanted money for his
            mother i give him a little change
            and as i supposed he wanted
            it for himself as edd<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">10</a> said
            he had a boy waiting for him outside
            loo<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">11</a>  wanted me when she was here
                to find out when jims birth day<a href="#n17" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r17">12</a>
            was so i wrote a little note and
            sent it by george for nanc<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">13</a>
            to
            write it down and i beleive
            it was the next day nanc sent
            a boy here with a letter and
            said she was on the street
            the night before and dreadful
            to read) the boy said it was a
            strange boy she said he must
            wait for an answer i told
            the boy i was sorry for her but
            i had no money to help her
            she said in the letter i could take

            so saturday night georgey
            came again after money
            he was very ragged but
            i had none to give i think
            he is very bad boy indeed
            i think the saturday night he
            wanted it for himself)
            well after i had been so
            annoyed with the letter and
                georgey s coming) i had a
                letter from mr Heyde<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">15</a>
            he had said in a former letter
            he was going to dispose of some
            pictures at montreal he said this
            in his last letter he hadent
            sold them yet he was waiting
            to hear more particulars
            and that he had got 150 dollr
            from the bank and gave his note
            for three months and if he
            had to take up any more money
            he should come strait to
                brooklyn) well walt i
                had to laughf i thought
            that was worse than nanc
            i dont suppose he had any
            idea of coming but it seemed
            to me so rediculous he dident
            say whether he was coming

                    write Andrew Jackson Whitman's friend James Cornwell, a judge in City Hall,
                    about placing the children in an orphan asylum (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00544">May? 1868</a> and her <a href="duk.00545">June 25,

                    the child born the spring following Andrew's death in 1863, was run over by a
                    brewery wagon in September 1868 (see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
