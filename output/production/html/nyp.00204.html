            <p class="tei_p">Your letter come safe this morning, enclosing Han's—I was very glad to get both—Mother, I wrote you three letters last week, the second one was in a big envelope, &amp; the last was a small one you ought to have got Saturday—I feel quite unsettled how to send any thing—the letters seem to be so liable to be stolen—but I shall certainly fix it so as you get something every week, mother, some how—Seems to me George's arrangements, &amp; the buying of the lots, &amp;c. are very good—also the shop—As Jeff says, he must have patience—Love to Matty &amp; the children—&amp; good bye for present, mother dear,</p>
