            <p class="tei_p">Good breakfast at 9½ of chocolate, toasted Graham bread &amp; broil'd chicken
                — enjoy'd all. Have rec'd a nice letter this mn'g f'm Mary Costelloe, return'd to London city—all well—Pearsall
                    S[mith] well as formerly, (one eye sight however
                quite quench'd)—Rec'd also an acc't (in Pall Mall Gaz: Oct: 28) of a visit to
                me f'm the good fellow, Mr Summers, M P, I believe mention'd to
                you in letter months ago—I will send the acc't to
                you—the two paper notices Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span> &amp; in
                the Phil: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Bulletin</span>, (of N B,) must have now reach'd
                you—they were sent.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am pretty well, considering, but laggard &amp; a dull headache most of the
                time—partial bowel action this forenoon—I don't get out of my room at
                all—the 6th month now—Mr Musgrove is kind
                active &amp; considerate all through—dull, darkish, damp here to day—I
                sit here the same, the sash a little open'd—very moderate—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-11-04"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday noon</span> Nov: 4</span>—Bright, sunny, quiet day—am
                feeling ab't my easiest—fair bowel movement—the big book gets
                on—title page has been made of a big medallion profile of me, (lettering on
                it)—suits me—am thinking (composing it now) of a short concluding note
                at end—will see how I can get it in shape—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tom Harned &amp; his brother Frank &amp; young Mr.
                    Corning have just call'd &amp; spent a short half hour (I
                don't know but I find myself <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">talking more</span> than I used
                to—talking perhaps more than ever)—I enclose you several letters (I send
                them as a foil, your duties &amp; works there must be dry)—if you don't feel
                to read them, put it off for a better season, or put it aside altogether—I
                suppose Edward Wilkins will be here to-morrow—Mr M, my
                present nurse, is sort o' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">vexed</span> ab't it all—he is a
                good fellow too, &amp; I am almost glum ab't his going—I liked him
                    well—Horace did not, &amp; has not—H remains
                &amp; is perfectly faithful &amp; I depend on him more than words could
                describe—y'r letter came last evn'g.</p>
