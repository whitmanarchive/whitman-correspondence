                it is really the toughest whack of all coming on the rest, &amp; the condition I am &amp;
                have been in—one of the best points is a good bowel discharge an hour ago, the
                first of a week—fortunately too the weather is favorable again—sweat freely—eat
                little or nothing—drink milk punch—have g't thirst—phlegm accumulations in throat
                &amp; chest pretty bad still but not as bad (half strangling me at night) as they
                were—I am at this moment sitting here in big chair, some headache &amp;c but more
                comfortable than might be expected—</p>
