            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received a Postal card from you yesterday. I wrote to you a long time ago, two letters, 
                <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_torn tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_extent_unk">[torn away]</span> both have been unanswered <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">untill​ </span><span class="tei_corr">until​

                now. I was afraid you might be very sick, and unable to write, 
                and so became very anxious about you.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad however that it is not so. I was to New York a couple of weeks ago, and saw Uncle George.

                also but without an answer. He told me he was afraid something was wrong with you so you see you are not
                forgotten. I often think of you, and how I would like to come and see you or have you to do the same to me.</p>
