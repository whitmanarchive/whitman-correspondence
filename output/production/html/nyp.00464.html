                    exact number of copies of the second Philadelphia impression. Since he referred
                    to the "cautious 1000" copies of the first impression, presumably this printing
                    was larger. Whitman wrote in a letter to John Burroughs on <a href="med.00691">August 13</a> that the second impression was "now
                    nearly gone." On <a href="nyp.00465">August 27</a> he wrote to O'Connor
                    that Rees Welsh &amp; Co. were "paying out their 3d edition." On <a href="nyp.00468">September 17</a> he wrote to O'Connor that "they are
                    now on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">their fourth</span> Phila: ed'n L of G." The fifth
                    impression was run off in October (see the letter from Whitman to Sylvester
                    Baxter of <a href="nyp.00446">October 8, 1882</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00464_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00464_n3"><span>See the letter from
