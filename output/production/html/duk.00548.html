                    15, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only "wensday," and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the date July 15, 1868. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
                    Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–75], 2:361). July 15, 1868, was a
                    Wednesday, and the date assigned by Bucke is correct because it corresponds with
                    stories about politics in the newspaper and because Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    replied directly to a query in Walt Whitman's most recent letter. The letter
                    refers to the Democratic presidential candidate Horatio Seymour, and Louisa drew
                    from an article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, which
                    appeared on July 7. She responded to Walt Whitman's request for her (and George

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
