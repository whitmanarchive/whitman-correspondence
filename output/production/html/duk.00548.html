            of the car horses died and
            he laid just acrost the
            street and he laid there
            till tuesday and the whole
            neighborhood was distressed
            with the smell the horses dropt
            from the cars in several other
            routs

                <p class="tei_p">georges house
                is
            raised was raised
            last saturday three
            story and cellar with
            stone under smith is
            in a hurry to get it
            done as he is going
            to oversee frenches
            buildings) i seldom
            hear from the st lou is
            folks they are very
            slow to write i wrote
            a letter to matty telling
            her i just wrote to let
            her know mamma
            lived in brooklyn
                yet i think matti might
            write oftener
            as for han
            i dont know as i shall
            ever hear from her
            it seems so strange
            if they was old and
            lame like me i

            shouldent think so
            strange well i suppose
            they all have enoughf
                to doo) o walter the
                nomanation aint it
            great i wish you
            could see the eagle
            it is worse than ever
            all the respectable 
            radicals is in favor
            of seymore
            the eagle
            says they are nearly 
            all copperheads around
            here
            but they are kinly
                put aback if chase
            had only been the one they
            would have carried
            everything before them
