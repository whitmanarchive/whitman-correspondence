                <p class="tei_p">We learn that early in the new year Walt Whitman will issue 
                    a small edition of his complete works in two volumes. "Leaves of Grass" will be one. The 
                    other, "Two Rivulets," alternations of prose and verse; the themes about as diverse as 
                    they can be—poetry, politics, the war, &amp;c. Mr. Whitman kept a diary from 1862 
                    to 1865 of scenes in Virginia, Washington; and the hospital, camps, battles, are given 
                    almost <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">verbatim</span>. A great part of "Two Rivulets," prose and poetry, 
                    is fresh matter, hitherto unpublished. Mr. Whitman will publish and sell his book himself. 
                    We are sorry to say that the health and strength of this poet are probably irrecoverable. 
                    His mind, however, is as brilliant as ever, and his spirits good. He is poor in purse, 
                    but not in actual want. He will probably end his days with his brother in Camden.</p>
