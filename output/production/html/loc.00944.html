                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship
                    with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the
                    Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen
                    defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate
                    residence. The correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous
                    as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship
                    with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00944_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00944_n2"><span>Charles Joseph Howells,
                    according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
                    perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
                    an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
                    in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00944_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_revised tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00944_n3"><span>Charles W. Eldridge was
                    one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
                    who put out the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In
                    December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
                    Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become
                    a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a desk for
                    Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For more on
