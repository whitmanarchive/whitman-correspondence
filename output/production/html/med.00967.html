            <p class="tei_p">The arrival of the steamer Niagara last evening, confirmed
                the intelligence of a total triumph by the "bloody Government" of England, over the
                Irish patriots. Let others say what they may, I believe
                few will, at heart, differ from the following opinion:—that the masses in
                Ireland have none to blame so much as themselves. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">determination</span> to achieve their freedom and rights, would effect that
                result. They have been tried in the balance and found wanting. Their most
                noble-hearted and devoted young leaders—men of as chivalrous courage and pure
                patriotism as ever warmed the human breast—have been caught and handcuffed by
                the minions of English tyranny, in the midst of the people, who ought to have laid
                down their lives before letting those brave spirits be thus imprisoned and outraged.
                What another few years may bring forth, we can only see as the time elapses; but for
                the present, I am free to confess, for one, I have lost my enthusiasm for the Irish
                people. They are to be pitied, for their sufferings, no doubt; but after craven
                conduct like that of the past month, our pity will hardly fail of borrowing a tinge
                of contempt. For a noble people, oppressed but dauntless, we utter our warmest
                sympathies; nor will America ever be backward in tokens of more substantial aid,
                when it can reach them. But for a people three times in number what our forefathers
                were when the latter defied the proudest earthly power, and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">defeated</span> it too—for a people, oppressed beyond all conquered
                communities that history ever mentioned, to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">flunk</span> at the
                vital hour when resolution and action would have overthrown their loathed
                tyrants—I openly confess I sicken of such conduct, and think it but right to
                apply fiercely the terms it surely deserves. As to the Irish not being "united,"
                little excuse is there in that. The Americans were not "united" either, in '76;
                wealth and influential tories were numerous; but the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">party of
                    independence had determination and</span> <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">COURAGE</span> and would to a man, or women
                either, have fought against any odds, and died fighting before deserting the meanest
                of their leaders. "Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow;" and until they show the hearts and the hands to do it,
                let them never ask for assistance from abroad.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The isle of New York is somewhat frighted from its
                propriety, just now, by the advent of Yellow Jack, who
                has appeared in force at the Quarantine station five miles below the city, on Staten
                Island; and has, indeed, sought some victims in the neighboring villages of that
                lovely spot. The weather is bad for the fever—being very hot, stifling, and
                dry. The heat has caused a considerable emigration of city people again to country
                place near by.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Half the town is annoyed by the odor caused by the burnt
                gas-works—which, by the by, have removed already to better and more
                appropriate quarters, up on 21st street.</p>
