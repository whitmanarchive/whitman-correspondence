                    managing editor of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's
                    beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman. On <a href="loc.01957">January
                        23, 1874</a> (Whitman said "1884"), Swinton wrote what the poet termed
                    "almost like a love letter": "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of
                    the first edition of the 'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a
                    newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with
                    wonder, and felt that here was something that touched on depths of my humanity.
                    Since then you have grown before me, grown around me, and grown into me." He
                    praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> on April 1, 1876
                    (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span>
                    [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 36–37). In 1874, Swinton was a
                    candidate of the Industrial Political Party for the mayoralty of New York. From
                    1875 to 1883, he was with the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>, and for the
                    next four years edited the weekly labor journal, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John
                        Swinton's Paper</span>. When this publication folded, he returned to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. See Robert Waters, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Career and
                        Conversations of John Swinton</span> (Chicago, 1902), and Meyer Berger, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The History of The New York Times</span>, 1851–1951 (New
                    York: Simon and Schuster, 1951), 250–251. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01698_n2 note" id="loc.01698_n2"><span>Since the press had not reported his
                    speech before the American Institute sympathetically (see Whitman's <a href="loc.01695">August 5, 1871</a> letter to the American Institute),
                    Walt Whitman wanted Swinton, who was no longer editor of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>, to place an "official" but anonymous reply in the
                    newspapers named. Edwin Haviland Miller had not found the notices. However, at
                    Yale there is a detailed answer to the newspaper attacks on this poem which Walt
                    Whitman prepared for an unidentified newspaper. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
