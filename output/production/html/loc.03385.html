                I have received and heartily thank you for the papers you have sent and the welcome copy of "Good bye! My Fancy."<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>
                I have not wanted to bother you during your severe illness, hence my silence. But we have followed with interest any information 
                about you especially the facsimile letter which Dr. Johnston<a href="#n4102" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4102">2</a> of Bolton was kind enough to send me and the article in a late
                "Review of Reviews"<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">3</a> with a sketch of your house and a little chit chat on your political opinions (I have much the same opinions
                myself of late years, but that is not surprising for they are simple deductions from the spiritual principle
                of the spirit of "Leaves of Grass.") I gave a lecture on "Walt Whitman, the Poet of Democracy" to an audience of 3 or 400 people at a 
                Sunday night meeting of the Australasian Secular Association<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">4</a> and was very well received. The subject was evidently 
                unfamliar but its reception gave me great hopes that it will not be so long in that quarter anyway. I made the acquaintance of
                another Whitman enthusiast at the meeting, Mr John Sutherland M.A.,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a> and I can assure you we have had some glorious evenings together
                since talking of you and with you. He tells me that he has only read L. of G. once, but wants to read it no more.

                a portrait I was able to give him. Mr Sutherland &amp; Jim Hartigan<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">8</a> want a copy of "Good bye my Fancy." Could
                you send price, please. Fred Woods<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">9</a> would like one of those portraits where you appear with (as it were) storm tossed beard,
                your hat on, and a hearty, sea-captain-like look on you. And, if it would not be too much trouble, with your name on it.
                He's a grand fellow Fred, and tossed as he was on seas of doubt &amp; deserts of the barrenest materialism,
                you have become a virtual religion to him as you have to more than him. Mr Sutherland has translated Freiligrath's<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">10</a>
                article on you (from Dr. Bucke's<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">11</a> book<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">12</a>). It is wonderful what misunderstandings are about concerning your poems of sex.

                bring it about, which I am glad to say soon died. For this change as for many others, I must thank you. I like to hear
                your ideas on Australians and would say much myself but that I don't want to bother you too much. We want a Walt Whitman here:
                ours is a democracy too with ever more hopeful prospects than yours but with great dangers ahead (especially social) and here 
                too the song of material interests drowns the other pieces in the chorus.

                We love you all, and greet you with sympathy in your illnesses and with growing hopes for your speedy recognition by all

                    self-styled "poor clerk in an obscure library" in Melbourne, Australia, wrote
                    for the first time to Walt Whitman on March 12, 1890, although there is extant
                    an unsent draft letter written on August 6, 1889. From his confessions in
                    various letters it is clear that O'Dowd, the son of an Irish policeman, had a
                    lonely and loveless childhood, that he was reared a Roman Catholic only to
                    become a freethinker, that he became a teacher at an early age but then drifted
                    (not unlike Walt Whitman) from job to job, and that despite his marriage the
                    year before in his own eyes he was "a failure" and "an enigma to myself." He saw
                    Whitman as an heroic father figure: "Had Carlyle added another chapter to his
                    'Hero Worship' the 'Hero as Nurse' with Walt Whitman as subject would have
                    worthily capped his dome" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    Australasian Convention, which was held in Sydney in March and April 1891,
                    officially marked the start of the journey for six British colonies—New
                    South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australian, Western Australia, and
                    Tasmania—toward nationhood. In a process that took several years, the
                    colonies agreed upon a Constitution Bill, and the British Parliament passed The
                    Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act in 1900. Queen Victoria gave her
                    royal assent to the legislation, which took effect on January 1, 1901. At the
                    start of 1901, Australia's six colonies became a nominally independent nation,
                    able to collectively govern as the unified Commonwealth of Australia.  </span></span> [<a href="#r1b">back</a>]</li></ul>
