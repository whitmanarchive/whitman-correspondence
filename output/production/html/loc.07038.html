            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have but lately read your poems, Leaves of Grass, but I find in them so much
                encouragement and hope, and such a great personality, that I write to express my
                simple thanks for the gift of the book and the great thoughts in it. Though I belong
                to England, and am English heart and soul, I know your America, who finds in you her
                first poetical expression, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from New York to Texas,
                and Minnesota, and the great West, Oregon, Washington, and California. I have toiled
                and travelled thousands of miles on the Pacific slope, and only regret that I had
                not Leaves of Grass with me to make me see even more than I did in three years of
                arduous struggle. But I thank you now, and with all sincerity, for a new religion
                and the knowledge of a great personality. In all events to come for me, you have had
                a great influence,</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">and I am, dear sir, yours gratefully</span>
