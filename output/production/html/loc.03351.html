            <p class="tei_p">About twelve years since, I was in Boston and looking at the books of an old book-stall in a passage of Washington St. when I saw your "Leaves of Grass", opened the book, and saw <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a Revelation</span>. I was 'poor', the book was 'expensive', but I felt that whatever the 'cost' I must <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">posses​ </span></span> it. No words will serve to indicate the value your living words have been to me. In all my troubles and successes I have been strengthened by

Though most of the people I have read extracts, or lent your book, to have utterly failed to appreciate you, I have never faltered in my faith and love, and have always esteemed you as the Messenger of this age. (My <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">words</span> seem utterly paltry and drivelling, and I am thoroughly ashamed of them. But you know what I desire to utter.)</p>

I have never received it, and wish <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> to send it, and also to send me, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">if you can</span>, a copy of your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">original edition</span> of 'Leaves of Grass'.

He writes 'glorious', and, by that, means <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">really</span> the utmost degree of excellence. I never knew him use the word before, except as describing some scenery or valorous action.
