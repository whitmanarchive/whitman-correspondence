                    <p class="tei_p">James Matlock Scovel began to practice law in Camden in 1856. During the
                        Civil War he was in the New Jersey legislature, and became a colonel in
                        1863. He campaigned actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special
                        agent for the U.S. Treasury during Arthur's administration. In the 1870s
                        Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast, as he did on
                        December 2 and 9, 1877 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                        the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                        Washington, D.C.). For a description of these breakfasts, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</span>, ed. William Sloane
                        Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel, see George
                        R. Prowell's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The History of Camden County, New Jersey</span>
                        (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886). </p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Apparently Whitman sent this note to Scovel, who was hospitalized shortly
                        before the presidential election in 1876. The Camden lawyer included it in
                        an article entitled "Walt Whitman: A Symposium in a Sick Room," which
                        appeared in the Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Post</span> on November 18,
                        1876. Scovel was one of Whitman's publicity agents at this time (see
                        Whitman's <a href="rlc.00013">July 31, 1875</a> letter to Rudolf
                        Schmidt).</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
