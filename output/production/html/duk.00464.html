                    offered to return to Washington earlier if requested. Even if Walt left as

                    late in writing after his return to Washington. Though no Whitman letters from
                    late December or January 1865 are extant, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman acknowledged
                    a letter from Walt in her <a href="duk.00465">December 10, 1865</a>

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    during the summer had told Walt Whitman that she had received "5 books," copies

                    presumably the "first ones" that she mentions in this letter. Walt had inquired
                    "whether you got the package of 5 Drum-Taps" about a week before her June letter
                    (see his <a href="wwh.00008">May 25, 1865</a> letter to Louisa). <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, a series of poems about Walt Whitman's Civil
                    War experience, was published in 1865. It was later integrated into the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and later editions.
