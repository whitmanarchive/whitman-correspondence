                been under the sod fifteen months ago—at least. I was real glad to get Miss
                Alys' letter to you, re Mrs Costelloe, and to see by it that Mrs C. was in better health. I
                was also glad to get the cutting re Browning who seems to have been a mighty fine
                fellow. I sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> like to know whether he was really of
                Jewish stock (as they say) I think it more than likely I believe that is the
                greatest stock of all and am never surprised to find that it is an element in a
                great man. Well, we still have La Grippe here though things are mending a little

                out of bed again but are a long way from up to par yet. There are still many members
                of the staff (attendants &amp;c) who are sick or half sick. I hope hope however we
                are over the worst of it. Willy Gurd is mending, is able to sit
                up now. The children are mostly better but some of them ailing yet. I have opened an
                infirmary for 40 patients—20 men and 20 women—within the last few
                days—this has been making a little extra work lately so that La Grippe struck
                us in a bad time—but we will worry along and after a little we shall get into
                daylight again.</p>
