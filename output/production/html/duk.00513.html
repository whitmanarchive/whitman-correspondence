            <p class="tei_p">i have got this
                letter by times it is only half past 12
                on monday and i have got it the one
                was mailed on sunday i mean
                and i couldent rest contented
                untill i wrote to let you know
                i had got it with the 5 dollar and
                i got one on saturday with 2 doller
                so you see i can stand another snow
                storm and be comfortable but i dont
                think it will be much of a storm
                this time) also i got all the papers
                last
                week and have got three to day with
                the letter the letter man is most too
                clever the 50 cts and i have given him
                25 since) i find giving such people a small
                sum once in a while does much good
                and i always say thank you when he 
                gives me a letter i dont know what
                i would have done yesterday without
                those papers i had harpers weekly
                
                and
                the papers so i got through the day quite
                well) i got a letter from matty
                to day
                she likes it very well there now she 
                has got acquainted with some of the
                boarders one lady invited her out to ride
                in a beautiful carriage she says she has
                been so awfull homesick she has got over
                in in some measure but i expect matt
                wants to see me she misses me more
                than she thought she should but when
                they get keeping house she will get
                better contented there is a first rate

                school near where they are going to live
                so hattee
                can go i would send the letter
                but
                i think she will write to you herself soon
                well Walt molly hasent come yet i
                expected her sure them fine days last
                week i wrote two letters to her saying in the
                last one we should expect her the first good
                day) i wish i could get a letter from han
                i wrote very particularly about it
                that you wrote often to her that we
                supposed she got them but we never
                heard from her and i wanted her to come 
                this spring and make us a good visit
                but i have not had any answer)</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">george
                is away yet i looked some for
                him yesterday but he dident come mrs
                Hageman where he used to board
                was
                buried yesterday i dident know she
                was sick till i see her death in the eagle 
                (the old eagle how i dislike it yet i take 
                it if i dident see any other paper i
                should think andy
                was perfection and
                all the rest was crushed general grant
                in the bargain) he must be a bad man
                i like the chronicle very much)
                i was in hopes 
                mrs Oconor
                had returned for his sake if he
                is not very well it would probably make
                him more comfortable) matty says Jeffy
                is
                much better there than in brooklyn he is
                in very good spirits and glad they came
                i have expected davis
                all last week but
                he is to come this week matty says) but they 
                will eventually she says settle in brookly<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">n</span>

                for mammas ideas good luck to you 
                walter dear dont you remember your poor old
