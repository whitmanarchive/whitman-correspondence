                    nickname. In mid-February, the illness and expected death of Fanny Van Nostrand
                    (Mary's husband Ansel's mother) had delayed Mary's plans for a visit to Louisa.
                    However, Mary promised—were Louisa to request a visit—that "you will
                    see molly quick" (see Mary's February 15, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman, Trent Collection, Duke University). Louisa also informed Walt Whitman
                    that weather would delay her daughter's visit: "mary hasent come yet the weather
                    has been very bad indeed so i think she could not have got here last sunday was
                    awfull" (see her <a href="duk.00512">February 12, 1868</a> letter to
                    Walt). Mary, Walt Whitman's younger sister, married Ansel Van Nostrand, a
                    shipwright, in 1840, and they lived in Greenport, Long Island. Mary and Ansel
                    had five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and Isadore "Minnie." See

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    the Radical Republican efforts to remove him from office ultimately failed.

                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
