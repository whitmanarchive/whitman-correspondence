            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I wish to thank you most heartily for your gift to me which I have just received
                from Mrs Wharton. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I could not have received anything from America which I should prize as I do this
                Volume of the Leaves of Grass. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Since I first read your poems years ago now they have always had a great influence
                on my thoughts and wishes. I should have liked to <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03510.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03510.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03510.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> write to you then, but I did not
                think I had a right to, and I wished to see you and talk to you, but I never had
                the opportunity. Your gift has given me at least the right to thank you now not only
                for it but for the great good I have got form your work. Every man I suppose worries
                out some idea of the right life for himself, but your books have helped me much in
                getting a truer view of things than I started with. I have found out the truth of
                your words too from my short <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03510.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03510.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03510.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> experience of life in deed as well as in thought. You have many
                more worthy listeners but none more gratified than myself. Your Leaves of Grass I
                keep with my Shakespeare and my Bible and it is from these three that I have got
                more sympathy than from any other books. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I should like to tell you too that you have many more friends here than you can ever
                have heard of by letter or paper, men and women who have got a good hold of your
                poems and their pith. </p>

                for you to do so. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> You will not I hope think that I wish to give you the trouble of sending or writing
                any answer to these few lines. I have not written for that at all, but simply
                because I wanted you to know that I am very grateful to you and that I am yours
                faithfully </p>
