                    signed a contract with Eckler to stereotype 500 copies for $254.00: "The
                    workmanship is to be first class in every respect &amp; to be completed, &amp;
                    the printed sheets delivered within one month from this date" (F. DeWolfe
                    Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> [Gainesville, FL: Scholars'
                    Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1959], xxxv). The contract called for "one hundred
                    &amp; twenty pages," but since the book contained only 72 pages, Eckler
                    submitted on <a href="loc.00853">April 22</a> a bill for $192.85, of
                    which $138.00 had been paid. According to Whitman's notations on the
                    statement, he paid $20.00 on April 26 and again on <a href="rut.00002">May 2</a>. Whitman sent this letter in answer to Eckler's request of <a href="loc.00854">May 1</a> that the balance be paid. On <a href="loc.00855">May 4</a>, Eckler issued a receipt for $34.85, and
                    included a receipt from Coridon A. Alvord, printer, for the stereotype plates,
                    which he had placed in his vault. On <a href="loc.00880">April 26</a>,
                    Eckler had informed Whitman that the book was "now to press" and would "be ready
                    for the Binders next Monday morning." For details on the printing history and
