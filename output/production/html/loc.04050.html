            <p class="tei_p">Your postcard came to hand some little time ago.<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">1</a> I was pleased to get it, to hear of your being well, &amp; with your friends. I have been extremely busy seeing after the new edition of my father's book;<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> the work of seeing such a richly illustrated "edition de luxe" through the press was enormous, but it is done! The binders are now doing their work, &amp; next Tuesday the reviewers will be doing theirs—I defy them to find any fault with the book. I dare say you think it "tall" talk, but I think that it is the most perfectly gotten up book that I ever have seen. My mother has written an admirable memoir of my father at the end of the second vol.</p>

           <p class="tei_p">I thought that this was to be the title of your prose volume. I will undertake the illustrations, choosing the paper (hand made), everything except the expense of reproducing, etc. I should say London is the place to have things executed in: if you wish to give photos they must be drawn by an artist and reproduced; no photo ever looked well in a book yet! they haven't decorative importance and don't blend with type. I should suggest that we should imitate the artistic size &amp; style of your earliest edition of "Leaves of G.," a large, thin, flat volume, a fanciful, but as inexpensive as possible, cover written in gold on blue, a waterlily say: but I could think this over. I will design fanciful tailpieces to be woven in with the text; as a frontispiece the drawing that I gave you, retouched by me, and reproduced by the Typographic Etching Company, 23 Farringdon street, London, E. C. All these are only suggestions, which I am prepared to execute in right earnest thought. I read your letter to mother with interest. We like our new house so much, &amp; I am sure that you would. You must come and stay with us &amp; stroll on Hampstead Heath, &amp; ride down into London upon an omnibus &amp; sit to some good sculptor here in London (Boem say). And you yourself could make arrangements with the publishers. With remembrance to friends,</p>
