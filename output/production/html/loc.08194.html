                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    Bolton, founded the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston
                    and Wallace corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members
                    of the Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet
                    and published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace,

                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February

                    later to express in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cosmic Consciousness</span> (1905). Bucke
                    sent his notes about the gathering to Horace Traubel on September 17 and asked
                    that he edit them for inclusion in a projected volume of essays. Bucke and
                    Traubel had already begun to make plans for a collected volume of writings by
                    and about Whitman. The book, titled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re Walt Whitman</span>
                    (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893), was edited by Bucke, Traubel, and Thomas

                    1893. Bucke quoted Whitman's sentence of approval to Traubel on September 21,
