            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I believe I must send you a line for Saturday though I have little or nothing to write about—I am sitting here alone in the office, writing by my lamp—I went over to Baltimore last evening for a little trip—saw Mr. Emerson—he lectured there—John Burroughs wanted to go over &amp; hear him—it was not interesting to me at all—but we had a pleasant little jaunt—got back about ½ past 11—Nothing different in the office—I except to go over in the Treasury Building, in the office of the Solicitor of the Treasury, as I told you—the new Attorney Gen'l Mr. Williams has assigned me there—but several important bits of work have had to be done just now, &amp; today &amp; yesterday I have had to do them—(as the old ladies say "I guess they'll miss me a good deal more than they 'spected")—so I have been held on to here so far—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I hope this will find you well of your cold—and that you'll have a good Sunday—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Congress convenes again next Monday—I met a man who saw Jeff about nine days ago in St. Louis. Good bye for this time, dear mother—</p>
