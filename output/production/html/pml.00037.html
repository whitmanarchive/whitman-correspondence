            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I believe I must send you a line for Saturday though I have little or nothing to write about—I am sitting here alone in the office, writing by my lamp—I went over to Baltimore last evening for a little trip—saw Mr. Emerson—he lectured there—John Burroughs wanted to go over &amp; hear him—it was not interesting to me at all<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—but we had a pleasant little jaunt—got back about ½ past 11—Nothing different in the office—I except to go over in the Treasury Building, in the office of the Solicitor of the Treasury, as I told you—the new Attorney Gen'l Mr. Williams<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> has assigned me there—but several important bits of work have had to be done just now, &amp; today &amp; yesterday I have had to do them—(as the old ladies say "I guess they'll miss me a good deal more than they 'spected")—so I have been held on to here so far—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I hope this will find you well of your cold—and that you'll have a good Sunday—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Congress convenes again next Monday—I met a man who saw Jeff about nine days ago in St. Louis. Good bye for this time, dear mother—</p>

                    Institute on Tuesday, January 2, 1872, on the subject "Imagination and Poetry."
                    Yet Walt Whitman wrote as though he had heard Emerson on Thursday, January 4,
                    1872. See Ralph Rusk, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson</span> (New
                    York: Columbia University Press, 1939), 6, 187–197. Walt Whitman conveyed
                    to Emerson an invitation from Charles Sumner; see Rusk, 6, 193. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00037_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00037_n2"><span>Note also Walt Whitman's

                    were almost identical: he too believed that Emerson failed to perceive "the
                    needs of the American people today" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
