                    <p class="tei_p">This letter dates to between May 2 and May 4, 1860, with the earlier dates
                        having a higher probability. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter May 3,
                        1860, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                        1961–77], 1:53, n. 19). Bucke's date cannot be confirmed, but it must
                        be very close.</p>

                        acknowledged receipt of "Mother's letter." These two facts narrow the range
                        of possible dates for Louisa's letter to between the last few days of April
                        and the first week of May. Multiple factors suggest a more narrow date
                        range, immediately after May 1. The Brown family had begun to settle into
                        the house, and they presumably moved very near May 1, the traditional moving
                        day in Brooklyn. The newspaper coverage of a notable prize fight and the
                        Democratic political convention, both of which Louisa pointedly excluded
                        from her letter, were at their most intense from Saturday, April 28 through

                    17, 1860 bare-knuckle boxing match between American John C. Heenan and
                    Englishman Tom Sayers. Lasting over two hours and counted at 37 (or 42) rounds,
                    but inconclusive because it was broken up by police, the match is considered the
                    first international boxing championship (see "The Great Prize Fight," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, April 28, 1860, 2; "The Great

                    1860. Despite a walkout by pro-slavery southern delegates after the adoption of
                    a moderate pro-slavery platform, Stephen A. Douglas (1813–1861) was unable
                    to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote to secure the nomination. Newspapers
                    provided daily convention coverage and commentary. </span></span> [<a href="#r12">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">13. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00424_n13 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00424_n13"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Vaughan was one of Walt's most important relationships from the Pfaff's period.
                    Ed Folsom and Kenneth M. Price associate Vaughan with "the sequence of

                    the Battle of Antietam and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the Union

                    impression on Tyndale. Whitman wrote to his mother that Tyndale "has been to see me
                    again—always talks about you" (see Whitman's <a href="duk.00382">June 29,
