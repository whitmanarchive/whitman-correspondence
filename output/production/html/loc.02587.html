            <p class="tei_p">I have had the good fortune to read your Poem "Leaves of Grass"—I have read
                nothing hitherto in which in a large sense I recognized my nationality—this
                Poem could not have been written but on the Soil of North America, nor by any other
                than one of her own new race of men—its surpassing worth to me is in its broad
                conception of our thought and action;—it forces our advance in these—in
                it we recognise ourselves—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was a matter of little importance that Longfellow<a href="#n0367" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0367">2</a> translated
                for us the poetic thought of the German—or that Bryant<a href="#n15" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r15">3</a> continued his labours in the English School—or
                that Poe<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">4</a> produced his perfect Poem—these things
                we had before—Carlyle<a href="#n1065" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1065">5</a> also wrote before Emerson<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">6</a>—but this is our own—I thank you for
                it—I have not been able to procure a copy of it here, nor can I discover
                whether it has been privately printed as I judge from the title—if not may I
