                    178). In the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span> on May 17, 1879, Whitman
                    described Caswell ploughing in a raspberry field (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                        Days</span>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
                    340). After Burroughs informed Whitman of the death of Caswell's brother,
                    Charles, the poet copied verbatim Burroughs's sketch of the young man in "Three
                    Young Men's Deaths," printed in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cope's Tobacco Plant</span> and
                    later in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> (157–158). Whitman sent the

                    (1849–1916) was Richard Watson Gilder's sister. Whitman met her, probably
                    for the first time, at a reception given by her brother on June 14, although he
                    wrote to her in 1875 (see the letter from Whitman to Gilder of <a href="yal.00279">December 30, 1875</a>). At this time Jeannette Gilder
                    was writing a literary column for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span>.
                    With her brother Joseph, she founded <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span> in 1881
                    and was its editor until 1906. Whitman wrote to Jeannette Gilder, evidently
                    about the biographical sketch, on December 20, 22, and 30 (Whitman's Commonplace
                    Book).
