            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter, with cheering wishes &amp; prophecies came last Tuesday—God bless you, boy—for all such things help much—I had a bad spell this morning—have something of the kind pretty often—Still it seems certain I am improving, 
                generally,—&amp; that my general strength is better <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01749.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01749.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01749.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>I am not near as bad 
                as I was five weeks ago—have some hours in which I feel quite like myself again—Keep up good heart nearly all the time—&amp; you must too, dear son.

            <p class="tei_p">—So I see Beau Hickman has died of a stroke of paralysis—in the paper this morning 
                I see a piece about his body being resurrected from potter's field—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete I see a collision of some trains on the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Baltimore​ ">B.</span>​  &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Potomac​ ">P.</span>​  road reported 
                in the tunnel at Baltimore yesterday morning early in which a brakeman named Hawkinson was instantly killed—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I was over to Philadelphia yesterday—there is a large reading room, the Mercantile Library, 
                10th st. where I go occasionally—it is quite handy—they have all the papers 
                from every where—have the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash.</span>​  Chronicle Capital, &amp;c.—Then I took a ride 
                in the Market st. cars, &amp; was caught in a violent rain at ½ past 7 coming home—the moment I got home, it stopt, &amp; cleared off a beautiful moonlit night.—It is clear and pretty hot here to-day—I am sitting here in the front room 
                in the same big old mahogany chair I gave mother 20 years ago, by the open 
                window writing this—I am feeling better since breakfast.

            <p class="tei_p">Pete the papers you sent came last Monday all right—I have rec'd a letter from Chas Eldridge—&amp; another from Walter Godey, the young man who is working for me as my substitute in the office—all was going on well in the office—I send a couple of papers to-day—nothing particular—send the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Herald</span>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Did I tell you that a doctor I have talked with here says my real disease is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the brain not being properly furnished 
                and nourished with blood</span>—(it is a disease the doctors call <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cerebral anâemia</span>)—the doctor says it has been long a-coming, &amp; will be long a-going—says I will get over it though—says the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">paralysis</span> comes from that, &amp; that it (the paralysis) is not very 'formidable'—I am following Dr. Drinkard's advice, taking no medicine, living very carefully—</p>
