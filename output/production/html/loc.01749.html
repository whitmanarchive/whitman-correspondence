                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
                    Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>,

                    Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Morning Chronicle</span> noted that Robert S.
                    Hickman, about 49 years old, was close to death. Evidently Hickman had
                    squandered a fortune of $40,000, had been disowned by his family, and was
                    now impoverished. On the same day the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>
                    observed that Hickman "is known throughout the country by reputation and
                    familiar to visitors to Washington for many years." He was interred in the
                    potter's field on September 2. On the following day, after a subscription was
                    raised among Washington businessmen to rebury the body in the Congressional
                    Cemetery, it was discovered that the remains had been desecrated. On September 4
                    the headlines in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chronicle</span> read: "Ghouls. | Graveyard
