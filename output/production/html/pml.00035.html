                <p class="tei_p">Mother, I wrote yesterday in my letter that I had a bad cold—I felt quite disagreeable yesterday, but went 
                to bed early, &amp; had a good sleep—to-day, Tuesday, I have felt all right.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It has been snowing some here to-day—I have been out walking though—it is not cold—As I write this, I am sitting 
                here in the office, (Treasury solicitor's) at 8 o'clock—have been reading &amp; writing all by myself—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, you get Mrs. Bruce to give you Gracie's address in Iowa—I have just got some nice copies of my Am. Institute piece from Boston, &amp; I will send her one—<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>let Mr. or Mrs. Bruce write the address on a slip of paper and you enclose it in your next—The last time I saw Arthur Price here<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> he invited me to come down to the Navy yard here to visit his vessel, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mahopac</span>—so Saturday, after I left work, I went down—but found myself a day after the fair—the vessel had gone about an hour before I got there—I believe she has gone to Norfold.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, on those envelopes you have you just cross out, draw a line over this way,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">3</a> when you send them, &amp; leave the rest, (like you did your last)—and they will come safe—I got your letter this morning—it is too bad the letter Mat sent Christmas was lost—that was a real nice present of a barrel of flour—Poor Mat,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">4</a> I feel real blue to think of her condition—but perhaps she will come round yet—and may be live as long as any of us—</p>
            
                <p class="tei_p">Well, mama dear, I will close for to-night &amp; finish it to-morrow—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am feeling well to-day—I think my cold must have been a false alarm, or else I have got off very easy—The weather is bitter cold here to-day, but bright &amp; clear—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">What do you hear from George—I kind of hope he will not go to Milwaukee—should not wish to have him &amp; Lou live so far away, unless the inducement is very great—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new in the office—I like this place just as well as the other—I have not a room to myself, it is true—We are pretty well crowded—they are mostly young men, &amp; a good deal of noise &amp; moving about—but I don't mind it, as it is only from 9 to 3—&amp; my work is much easier—Has Eddy got well of his cold?</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I shall probably be on hand to eat some of Mat's cake—Good bye for to-day, mother dear—</p>

                    piece" is "After All, Not to Create Only." The poem was printed by Roberts
                    Brothers of Boston, to whom Whitman had written on <a href="loc.01699">September 17, 1871</a>. Haight acknowledged the poem in her letter to
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on February 7, 1872: "I missed much of it the day it

                    Brooklyn in late April or early May of 1872, evidently for consultation with New

                    The diagnosis was cancer, mentioned in Walt Whitman's <a href="prc.00026">July 19, 1872</a> letter to Charles W. Eldridge. Jeff either accompanied
                    her or came for her; see Martha Whitman's letter to Louisa Whitman on May 27,
