            <p class="tei_p">It is five days since the election but the excitement has not yet subsided. The government will have a majority of about 30 but made up entirely
                from the outlying provinces—extreme east and extreme west Ontario gives them little or no majority and Quebec has gone badly against them.
                If old John A. (the Premier) was 20 years younger he might pull his party together and tide it over—but as it is I do not believe that he
                with his 76 years can pull through. He will keep things going for a while, of course, but when he strikes a rapid, and there are several bad ones
                just a little downstream of him, his boat is apt to go to pieces.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did I mention having received and read the "National Literature" piece? It is good, first rate in fact—the language a little

                cranky and queer in places but the thought fresh and vigorous and true. I like it well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This morning I have your card of 8<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> &amp; the "Critic" (sent by you) of 7<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>—thanks for it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your condition still seems wretched—you do not seem to rally—that is bad—why do you not send for a good doctor? Surely something
                could be done to give you relief.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We have had dark, damp, raw, very unpleasant weather here for some weeks. Today bright and pleasant—spring will soon be with us again—with you 
                it must be about arrived?
