      <p class="tei_p">I am about the same to-day, rather on the improve—have not tried to get out any
        more—feel pretty much depressed about Mat's death, (but it
        has been to her no doubt a relief from great pain)—Have just written a few lines to
          Jeff—Wrote yesterday to Han—Mother, you must not get gloomy. Feel better as I write—I am sitting up by
        the stove. </p>
