                    1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
                    others, wrote the "indispensable" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in

                        1776–1876</span> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
                    poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
                        1890—Recollections</span> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
                    in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
                        <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle): "I
                    liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
                    who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03234_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03234_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:
