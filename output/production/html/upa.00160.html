                    Whitman, "pinched by the cold," took "refuge in the house, by a window, whence I
                    get a full view of the crowd." He observed the people, "old &amp; young, a
                    hundred or more, mostly men &amp; young fellows, but a few housewives &amp;
                    young women . . . Very well they look too, in my opinion—not only handsome
                    &amp; open-eyed, and fresh &amp; independent, with wit enough, movements a
                    little sluggish, but none the less artistic for that—always evidencing
                    power—but with a certain heroic, rugged element through all" (Clifton
                    Waller Barrett Collection, University of Virginia). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00160_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00160_n2"><span>A cryptic reference to

                    Edward Cattell, another one of his young Kirkwood friends, to whom the poet had
                    written on February 10 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.). See the letter from Whitman to Edward Cattell of <a href="loc.01251">January 24, 1877</a>. Herbert Gilchrist noted that
                    Whitman was fond of quoting Cassius's speech to Brutus, "Well, honour is the
                    subject of my story" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Julius Caesar</span>, 1.2.91; Herbert

                        Writings</span> [London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887], 241). Whitman placed a large
                    bracket about this passage in the margin. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00160_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00160_n3"><span>A reference to the
