            <p class="tei_p">I have just returned from a two weeks' visit down in the Jersey pine woods and had a good time in the simple, savage way I like. Am well for me, sunburnt and fat. (Some twitchings, but I don't dwell on them.) Nothing very new in my affairs, sell a couple of books occasionally.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you saw my Riddle Song in the first number of Sunnyside Press<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—if not, I can send you the "Progress" with it in.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I delivered my Lincoln lecture last April 15 in Philadelphia—the same as the N.Y. version. I took it very coolly and enjoyed it—(No great audience—$90, after paying expenses).</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Abbott of Boston wrote to me for a poem for his May 22d "Emerson Number" of the "Literary World." I could not write him a poem, but I sent him a little prose criticism which I believe he is to print in said number.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dr. Bucke is coming here to Philadelphia about May 22.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Eldridge passed through here day before yesterday, returning to Washington . . . .</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I had the May "Scribner" and read it leisurely down in the woods—Stedman's Poe, and your "Notes."<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> (Scratched off my Emerson screed down there, as it was there I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  Abbott's letter.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hear from the Gilchrists; they are in London; the daughter Beatrice has suddenly abandoned her medical pursuits and intentions. Herbert thrives<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>. . . .</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hear at second remove, and vaguely, that Symonds is writing a book, or something, about me.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">. . . When you write, send me Smith Caswell's exact post office address, so I can send him papers.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> Don't forget.</p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">Is it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> who says so emphatically the blackbirds don't sing? What they call here the Virginia blackbird, with red dabbed shoulders—Harry Stafford says they do, at times, and very finely (and I say so, too)—How are you? How the arm? how the babe? Love to 'Sula—</p>
