        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am getting along real well, upon the whole—I went out and over to the office yesterday—
        went in &amp; sat down at my desk a few minutes—It was my greatest effort yet, 
        and I was afraid I had overshot the mark again, as I felt dizzy &amp; tired last night—
        But to-day I feel getting along all right—I am going out a little to-day, but not much—
        I feel now over the worst of my bit of sickness, &amp; comparatively comfortable—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Poor Martha—the thoughts of her still come up in my mind, as I sit here 
        a great deal of the time alone—Poor Jeff, &amp; poor children too—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have received a letter from Lillie Townsend—Aunt Sally is still living and well as usual, &amp; nothing very new—
        I have just got a second note from Mrs. Price—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I shall try to get out, &amp; get my Feb. pay, I have to get it from the old office, 
        &amp; then I will send you your $20. (I hope within a couple of days, or three at most)—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I expect Mrs. Burroughs here probably to-day with a carriage to 
        take me out riding—so you see I am beginning to sport around—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Every thing here now is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">inauguration</span>—&amp; will be till the 4th of March is over—
        for my part I want to get out of the way of it all—
      </p>
      
      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, mammy dear, &amp; to Georgey &amp; Lou &amp; all—</span>
