            <p class="tei_p">The month Ends today—I have been here five weeks. How time <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fugits</span>! I begin to feel restless to begin another seige of work. But
                mother is plotting ways to keep me here. I should like to stay with her. She has so
                much to say, &amp; remembers everything of our family life so clearly. And
                then, she is lonesome. My sister has gone home. My brother

                &amp; to the necessity of sitting alone to brood over the past. She dont exactly
                see why I can not do my work here. I explain; she understands for the moment; &amp;
                then returns to <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if tei_unclear_cert_medium">the</span> charge next

            <p class="tei_p">I am modeling a small bust of her. I tell her she has eyebrows like yours; cheeks

                only a round black spot appears. I shall bring on my bust of her when I come. My
                sister has a great amount of executive ability, and though moral &amp; liberal in all religious matters, almost
                to the verge of non-believing, she has the bump of discipline &amp; order big enough
                to serve the German Empire. Mother &amp; the rest of us are inclined to be lax in all
                such matters. So you see what's the matter when she (sister) is here. But, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">More's</span> the matter now she's gone, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> assume charge. My brother's wife died some years ago, leaving 3
                children. The boy, Henry, 16 years old, spends much of his time since I have been 
                here, "drawing Walter Whitman." I often look in upon you silently, &amp; see you and
                the room: The sitting room with Mrs. Davis,<a href="#n6113" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6113">2</a> the cat &amp; dog; robin &amp;
