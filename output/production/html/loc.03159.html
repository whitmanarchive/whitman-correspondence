            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The month Ends today—I have been here five weeks. How time <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fugits</span>! I begin to feel restless to begin another seige of work. But
                mother is plotting ways to keep me here. I should like to stay with her. She has so
                much to say, &amp; remembers everything of our family life so clearly. And
                then, she is lonesome. My sister has gone home. My brother 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03159.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                is busy in the shop; &amp; the children in school. I hate to leave her with her uncertain step,
                &amp; to the necessity of sitting alone to brood over the past. She dont exactly
                see why I can not do my work here. I explain; she understands for the moment; &amp;
                then returns to <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if tei_unclear_cert_medium">the</span> charge next
                day or two. Still, finally, she accepts the inevitable, and as the old hymn
                says—"Puts a cheerful courage on–."</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I am modeling a small bust of her. I tell her she has eyebrows like yours; cheeks
                like <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_es">Shillales</span>; and a
                double wallop under chin like Dr. Holmes. Her eyes have sort of grown together at
                the sides, so <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03159.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                only a round black spot appears. I shall bring on my bust of her when I come. My
                sister has a great amount of executive ability, and though moral &amp; liberal in all religious matters, almost
                to the verge of non-believing, she has the bump of discipline &amp; order big enough
                to serve the German Empire. Mother &amp; the rest of us are inclined to be lax in all
                such matters. So you see what's the matter when she (sister) is here. But, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">More's</span> the matter now she's gone, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> assume charge. My brother's wife died some years ago, leaving 3
                children. The boy, Henry, 16 years old, spends much of his time since I have been 
                here, "drawing Walter Whitman." I often look in upon you silently, &amp; see you and
                the room: The sitting room with Mrs. Davis, the cat &amp; dog; robin &amp;
                <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_high">bantams</span>. And out beyond, the "hens and things"—minus one thing! <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03159.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> And so, how is Aunt

                    croneing</span> and her stealthy, flat footed tread, I can't avoid seeing her among
                the immortals— "her back yard when I was a housekeeper and my cellar floor,
                was always clean enough to eat your dinner on." Yes yes; how well she'd
                    keep these golden
                stairs &amp; pavements of opal &amp; pearl in Paradise! Tell her when she comes
                around that I enquire about her, &amp; wish her good health &amp; happy days for
                many years yet—</p>
               <p class="tei_p">And Mrs. Mapes, &amp;
                little Johnie, is it? I presume they, (&amp; Johnie's sister) still drop in &amp;
                sometimes "take a bite." And the other lady &amp; her children—is it <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">Mrs</span>

                No; I never quite got her name.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And of course Mrs D. keeps everything in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">apple pie</span> order.
                Ah! the blessed old—. Long may it
                wave!— Long may <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> wave it!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose friend Harned puts in an appearance often. He is quite a remarkable man, I
                think. As the old puritan preacher Robinson (was it?) said of the "Bible, "I believe
                more light will break out of it when we are free." "or words to that effect. So when
                H. gets free of his many encumbering, political, judicial (I don't mean just

                think he may one day, and finds his way into the serener atmosphere &amp; more
                congenial line of thought. I expect more &amp; more of the real light within him will <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">
                    break out of him</span>. He has a vast deal of good insights, and seems to select the good <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03159.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03159.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> things you have done with more

            <p class="tei_p">The Smiths are I venture good friends, but I have yet to discern that they know the
                "track of the old <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">varmount</span>."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well. I am about sending you the Hicks. I shall mail to you to-morrow the engravings

                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">two</span> busts of Hicks—large &amp; small. The large

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Schultz, an old Hicksite likes the big one much. He was 16 when Elias came here
                in 28, &amp; remembers his stoping overnight at his father's. He says he thinks he may find some old letters
                Hicks wrote about that time. He knows that there were some &amp; he once read them.
                "Elias was a great man. A wonderful preacher—why, one Sunday before he
                finished his sermon tears were coursing down all our cheeks, young &amp; old. His
                doctrine was the simplest &amp; most effective—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span>

                one would suppose they would take a hint from him &amp; stand by their <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">own inner lights</span>. Instead they try to tell me the way
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Elias</span> expounded the Scriptures. Strange too he should
