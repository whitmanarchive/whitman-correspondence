            <p class="tei_p">Dear mother, I hope you are well &amp; in good spirits—I wish you would try to write to me every thing about home &amp; the particulars of Andrew's funeral, &amp; how you all are getting along—I have not rec'd the Eagle with the little piece in<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—I was in hopes Jeff would have sent it—I wish he would yet—or some of you would—I want to see it—I think it must have been put in by a young man named Howard,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> he is now editor of the Eagle, &amp; is very friendly to me—</p>

                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had described the death scene. Nancy went to bed on
                    Wednesday night and "in the morning she brought such a smell that Jeffy got
                    sick" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript,
                    and Special Collections Library). Meantime Jesse had been so affected by the
                    crisis that he had threatened Mannahatta and Martha, an incident which led the
                    explosive Jeff to exclaim in a letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a>: "I love Mat as I love my life—dearer by
                    far—and to have this infernal pup—a perfect hell-drag to his
                    Mother—treat [Martha] so—threaten to brain her—call her all
                    the vile things that he could think of—is a little more than I will stand.
                    He says he dont know any better—he lies—he does know better. I wish
                    to God he was ready to put along side of Andrew. There would be but few tears
                    shed on my part I can tell you. . . . To think that the wretch should go off and
                    live with an irish whore, get in the condition he is by her act and then come
                    and be a source of shortening his mother's life by years." Jeff finally proposed
                    that Jesse be hospitalized.On December 15(?), 1863, Mrs. Whitman minimized
                    Jesse's behavior, and gave Walt details of the funeral, including Nancy's "adue"
                    to friends that "we had taken [Andrew] away from her," when the body was brought
                    to the Whitman house (Trent Collection). Evidently Whitman had agreed with Jeff
                    that something must be done about Jesse, for on <a href="loc.00430">December
                        28, 1863</a>, Jeff wrote: "You wrote Mother abt getting Jess in the
                    Asylum—It does not seem to meet with her wishes—when I wrote you my
                    idea was that by each of us paying—say a $ a week—you and I and
                    George—that we could keep him in some one of the hospitals around New
                    York—I think it would be best yet. . . . I feel as if it was our duty to
                    relieve Mother of him." (Jesse was admitted to the Brooklyn State Hospital on
                    December 5, 1864; see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer: A

                    4, 1863, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that "there was a very good little
                    peice in the eagle last night about you" (Trent Collection), and promised that
                    Jeff would send it. In a note appended to a letter from George, dated December
                    9, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman said that she thought that the article had been
                    written by Dr. Ruggles. The "Personal" in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily
                        Eagle</span> on December 3, 1863, read in part: "Who is there in Brooklyn who
                    doesn't know Walt Whitman? Rough and ready, kind and considerate, generous and
                    good, he was ever a friend in need.…Surely such as he will find their reward
                    here and hereafter." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00805_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00805_n3"><span>Joseph Howard, Jr.
