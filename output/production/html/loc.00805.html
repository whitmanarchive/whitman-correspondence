            <p class="tei_p">The last word I got from home was your letter written the night before Andrew was buried, Friday night, nearly a fortnight ago—I have not heard any thing since from you or Jeff—Mother, Major Hapgood has moved from his office cor 15th st. &amp; I am not with him any more—he has moved his office to his private room—I am writing this in my room 456 Sixth st—but my letters still come to Major's care, they are to be addrest same as ever, as I can easily go &amp; get them out of his box—(only nothing need be sent me any time to the old office, as I am not there nor Major either—any thing like a telegraphic dispatch or express box or the like should be addrest 456 Sixth st, 3d story back room)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear mother, I hope you are well &amp; in good spirits—I wish you would try to write to me every thing about home &amp; the particulars of Andrew's funeral, &amp; how you all are getting along—I have not rec'd the Eagle with the little piece in—I was in hopes Jeff would have sent it—I wish he would yet—or some of you would—I want to see it—I think it must have been put in by a young man named Howard, he is now editor of the Eagle, &amp; is very friendly to me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am quite well—I have been out this morning early, went down through the market, it is quite a curiosity—I bought some butter, tea, &amp;c—I have had my breakfast here in my room, good tea, bread &amp; butter &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I think about you all more than ever—&amp; poor Andrew, I often think about him—Mother, write to me how Nancy &amp; the little boys are getting along—I got thinking last night about little California—O how I wished I had her for an hour to take care of—dear little girl, I dont think I ever saw a young one I took to so much—but I mustn't slight Hattie—I like her too—Mother, I am still going among the hospitals, there is plenty of need, just the same as ever—I go every day or evening—I have not heard from George—I have no doubt the 51st is still at Crab Orchard—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I hope you will try to write—I send you my love, &amp; to Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all—so good bye, dear Mother—</p>
