                very apprehensive last night. She talked strangely, and enquired in whispers to me,
                whether truly I wanted her to get well. I was with her, at her bedside repeatedly,
                and then retired, so as to leave her quiet, alone, as she desired: administered <span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">a</span>

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
