                very apprehensive last night. She talked strangely, and enquired in whispers to me,
                whether truly I wanted her to get well. I was with her, at her bedside repeatedly,
                and then retired, so as to leave her quiet, alone, as she desired: administered <span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">a</span>

                her poor head, and heart throbbing. Entreated me not to let her be taken to the
                hospital. This institution however is a place that many have preferred to be taken to, in

            <p class="tei_p">I was much encouraged yesterday, and got away from the house for a couple of hours,

                however—I can but try: I shall have to keep to the house to day: Han desires
                it: I have bought comforters and bedcloth sheets etc, and may be compelled to buy
                another stove: <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg">Doctor</span> <span class="unclear cut off tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_off tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">will</span>
