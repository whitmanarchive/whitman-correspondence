            <p class="tei_p">I have been thinking very often of you lately, and wishing that something might be
                done to lighten life for you. The nation is deeply in your debt for the services you
                rendered in the war, not to mention its deeper debt to you as a poet which will be
                appreciated more and more as the years go on. Hon. Henry B. Lovering,<a href="#n4250" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4250">1</a> the Member of

                like to do it, however, without consulting your wishes in the matter, and therefore
                I write to ask if I may not tell him to go ahead. The act would be purely voluntary
                on the part of Congress, and not in response to any petition from you.</p>

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on

                    informed Whitman that "the cast of your hand I shall soon send to Paris to be
