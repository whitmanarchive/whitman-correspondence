            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">It is a very fine September day here—it must be delightful down in Virginia—the sun shines just warm enough &amp; there is a slight haze, which makes it just right—I have been out just a little, but was glad to get back—I am feeling tolerable, 
                but my leg still gives out, in a few minutes' walk—I have had two or three quite 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good spells</span> this week,—sufficient to arouse my hopes,—but am in a pretty bad way yet—however I am not without some pretty steady <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">small</span> expectations, if not great ones. 
                I am enough better to be perceptible, &amp; to make me in hopes of getting better still—(but I have so many times got a little better, only to fall back again as bad as ever, or worse)—I have just had my dinner, nice beef steak, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">potatos​ </span></span>, &amp;c. My appetite still holds out—&amp; my sister cooks very nice, gets me what I want—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete your letter of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="September​ ">Sept.</span>​  8. came safe—also the Herald &amp; Republican—I send you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil.</span>​  papers.

            <p class="tei_p">My brother Jeff has been on here this week from St. Louis—got in a car in St. Louis, 6 Saturday evening, week ago, took off his boots 
                for easy shoes, and, (sleeping he says, very well &amp; sound in his bed on the car,) 
                had his meals regular—got in here at Philadelphia about 9 o'clock Monday morning, 
                in the same car, (which went on to New York)—He is now out on a good yacht excursion 
                from N.Y., out in the sound &amp; sea, for a week—quite a voyage—He only stopt here 3 or 4 hours—but is to return last of the month—both my brothers are stout &amp; hearty, 
                &amp; full of business, &amp; interested in it thoroughly—&amp; doing well.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I hear quite often from John Burroughs—he has bought a spot of land, 
                right on the Hudson river, about 80 miles from N.Y. &amp; is building himself 
                a house there, right on a steep bank, with the road on one side, 
                &amp; the river on the other—a 2½ story stone house—(but sufficient space between)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have heard from Charley Towner—I got a very nice letter from him Thursday—he said you met him Tuesday &amp; told him—A long while ago, I wanted to get a house 
                in conjunction with Charley &amp; his family, where I could have a couple of rooms, 
                &amp; they could see to them—&amp; that was one thing I wanted to write to him about, 
                to see if we could do it now—but he tells me his wife is quite sick—

                I quite pricked up my ears to read the short interview between Mr. Dubarry &amp; you, 
                &amp; what he said about the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">schedule</span> 
                &amp;c—I see you are a little <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nervous</span>, Pete—&amp; I dont wonder, nor blame you—Still the true point to attain is (like a good soldier, 
                or officer,) to keep on the alert, to do one's duty fully, without fail—&amp; leave the rest to God almighty
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I was reading the paper here this morning, &amp; I see a list of some new inventions 
                said to work first rate, among the rest this ☞<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> for car-coupling—I wonder if there is any thing in it—It is awful, the way men are slaughtered 
                of late years on the trains—there must be three or four hundred every year, 
                take the country through—&amp; the papers put 'em in in items of three or four lines, 
                down somewhere out of the way—such a thing as the killing of that young man 
                Harkinson,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in the Baltimore tunnel, a grand magnificent young <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">man</span>, no doubt—(while half the papers in the land have had long obituaries 
                &amp; notices of the death of that rotten old apple, Beau Hickman<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a>)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, son, I have made out quite a letter for you this time—My brother &amp; I 
                have been talking about the Balloon splurge<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> in New York—my brother is quite a balloonist, 
                in his belief—believes that something will yet come of it—I see they advertise to go yet, 
                perhaps this afternoon—but it is a wild undertaking—(perhaps an advertising humbug) anyhow
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I shall still remain here for the present—every thing seems to be going on smooth 
                in the office at my desk, from what I hear from my substitute<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>—He writes me now &amp; then—does my work very well, &amp; more work besides,—Dear Pete, I am much in hopes I shall be able to send some news before long 
                about my improvement—for good—&amp; something definite about my coming back to Washington—So long, dear son—you must try to keep up a gay heart &amp; let the world wag on as it may.

            <div class="enclosure"><p class="tei_p">A NEW CAR-COUPLER.</p> <p class="tei_p">Railroad officials have long felt the necessity of some arrangement that would obviate the dangerous manner in which they have been obliged to couple cars. Under the present system hundreds of deaths have resulted, and thousands of persons have been injured. Many inventions have been made in the way of a self-coupler, and for dispensing with the dangerous mode now in use, but upon trial nearly all have been found impracticable. The Harrisburg <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">State Journal</span> says that the object desired has at last been accomplished by a Mr. William A. Boyden, of that city. The invention consists of a coupler which is worked by a wheel on the side of the car, the pins being raised by an eccentric, which makes the coupling complete and sure without endangering the limbs or life of the brakeman. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">State Journal</span> says: Cars can be easily and surely coupled with Mr. Boyden's coupler, which ranges in height from six to eight inches, with perfect ease and safety. The brakeman or person making the coupling can do it by simply turning a wheel on the outside of the car. Mr. Boyden was formerly a foreman in one of the principal construction shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, at Altoona. He is now the superintendent of the American Railway Improvement Company, who have taken charge of this valuable invention and intend manufacturing the couplings.</p></div>

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    Hickman, about 49 years old, was close to death. Evidently Hickman had
                    squandered a fortune of $40,000, had been disowned by his family, and was
                    now impoverished. On the same day the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>
                    observed that Hickman "is known throughout the country by reputation and
                    familiar to visitors to Washington for many years." He was interred in the
                    potter's field on September 2. On the following day, after a subscription was
                    raised among Washington businessmen to rebury the body in the Congressional
                    Cemetery, it was discovered that the remains had been desecrated. On September 4
