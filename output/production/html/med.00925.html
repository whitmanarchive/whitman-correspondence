                    (1858–1929) was an English photographer and painter who specialized in
                    male nudes and maritime themes. Among his acquaintances were Oscar Wilde and
                    John Addington Symonds, who also corresponded with Whitman. Tuke moved to
                    Swanpool in 1885 and painted from a fishing boat that he converted into a
                    floating studio. For more on Tuke's artistic work, see C. Kains-Jackson, "H. S.
