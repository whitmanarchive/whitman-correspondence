        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still anchored here—sit up some, but only for a short spell at a time—am
        feeble, and have distress in the head—these are the worst features—but am
        gradually regaining the use of my left limbs—very, very slowly, but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">certainly gaining</span>—Doctor only comes now every other day—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I write Mrs. O'Connor is sitting here in the room, mending some stockings &amp;c for
        me—she has brought me some nice roast apple in a tumbler—It is a dark wet day
        to-day—not very favorable—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I rec'd your letter, acknowledging the money—I have written a short
        letter to Hannah, &amp; also one to Jeff—which they must have
        rec'd by this time—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I keep up my spirits very well—do not need for any thing—Love to you, &amp;
        all, dearest mother, </p>

        <p class="tei_p">I have tacked your picture up on the wall at the foot of the bed—the one I
          like—it looks as natural as can be—&amp; is quite company for me—as I am
          alone a good deal, (&amp; prefer to be)—</p>
