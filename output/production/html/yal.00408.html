                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
                    Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
                    and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
                    and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
                    William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
                    as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
                    relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r0450">back</a>]</li><li id="n0285">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n0285 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n0285"><span>Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde
                    (1823–1908), youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde
                    (ca. 1820–1892), a Pennsylvania-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
                    infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
                    Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"
