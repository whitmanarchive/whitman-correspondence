               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am going to write you to ask any friends you may be in communication with for aid for my soldiers. I remain here in Washington still occupied among the hospitals—I have now been engaged in this over seven months. As time passes on it seems as if sad cases of old &amp; lingering wounded accumulate, regularly recruited with new ones every week—I have been most of this day in Armory Square Hospital, Seventh st. I seldom miss a day or evening. Out of the six or seven hundred in this Hosp[ital] I try to give a word or a trifle to every one without exception, making regular rounds among them all. I give all kinds of sustenance, blackberries, peaches, lemons &amp; sugar, wines, all kinds of preserves, pickles, brandy, milk, shirts &amp; all articles of underclothing, tobacco, tea, handkerchiefs, &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c. I always give paper, envelopes, stamps, &amp;c. I want a supply for this purpose. To many I give (when I have it) small sums of money—half of the soldiers in hospital have not a cent. There are many returned prisoners, sick, lost all—&amp; every day squads of men from [the] front, cavalry or infantry—brought in wounded or sick, generally without a cent of money. Then I select the most needy cases &amp; devote my time &amp; services much to them. I find it tells best—some are mere lads, 17, 18, 19 or 20. Some are silent, sick, heavy hearted, (things, attentions, &amp;c. are very rude in the army &amp; hospitals, nothing but the mere hard routine, no time for tenderness or extras)—So I go round—Some of my boys die, some get well—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">O what a sweet unwonted love (those good American boys, of good stock, decent, clean, well raised boys, so near to me)—what an attachment grows up between us, started from hospital cots, where pale young faces lie &amp; wounded or sick bodies. My brave young American soldiers—now for so many months I have gone around among them, where they lie. I have long discarded all stiff conventions (they &amp; I are too near to each other, there is no time to lose, &amp; death &amp; anguish dissipate ceremony here between my lads &amp; me)—I pet them, some of them it does so much good, they are so faint &amp; lonesome—at parting at night sometimes I kiss them right &amp; left—The doctors tell me I supply the patients with a medicine which all their drugs &amp; bottles &amp; powders are helpless to yield.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you would ask any body you know who is likely to contribute—It is a good holy cause, surely nothing nobler—I desire you if possible could raise for me, forthwith, for application to these wounded &amp; sick here, (they are from Massachusetts &amp; all the New England states, there is not a day but I am with some Yankee boys, &amp; doing some trifle for them)—a sum—if possible $50—if not, then less—$30—or indeed any am't—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I am at present curiously almost alone here, as visitor &amp; consolator to Hospitals—the work of the different Reliefs &amp; Commissions is nearly all off in the field—&amp; as to private visitors, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">there are few or none</span>—I wish you or some of your friends could just make a round with me, for an hour or so, at some of my hospitals or camps—I go among all our own dear soldiers, hospital camps &amp; army, our teamsters' hospitals, among sick &amp; dying, the rebels, the contrabands, &amp;c &amp;c. What I reach is necessarily but a drop in the bucket but it is done in good faith, &amp; with now some experience &amp; I  hope with good heart.
