                    (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
                    (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Smith and later a mason named French. By
                    1868, the house business is balanced against George's work as an inspector of
                    pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George Washington Whitman,

                    540–547). Whitman had informed his mother of Alcott's appreciation for the

                    served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. The
                    connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
                    under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
                    Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector

                    connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. George's position
                    with the Brooklyn Water Works became more tenuous in 1869 after the
                    reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water Commissioners in April: Lane
                    resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00578">April 7, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman). Lane later designed and
                    constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city engineer, and he
