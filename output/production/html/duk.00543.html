            busy when he got back for
            matty to write because i wanted
            to hear but i have not got any
            if they have wrote to me i

            <p class="tei_p">be so long again without
            writing
            but i suppose they
            all have enoughf to doo without
            writing when one gets out of the
            way of writing its hard to get
            in it again matty was going
            to write to me so often she
            said before shee went away
            she would write every week
            i got the papers to day with the letter
            walter i like the chicago news
            very much i never saw one
            before i wish whenever you have
            one you would send it to me
            
            well walter dear we have leved
            to see another may day come and
            gone not as much moving as
            usual they say in the papers
            many has broke up houskeeping
            on the account of rents being
            so high i have been to look at
            several places george
                wants
            to get out of this place very much
            i went yesterday to look at one
            in carlton aven just out of fulton
            but it was no better nor any
            more room than we have here
            
           <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00543.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00543.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00543.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                
            and 10 doll more rent a month
            i would rather live here than
            there and all the places i have
            been to see was something that
            would make it disagreable
            in some way or other) here i
            can doo just as i like but
                of course there is some disagreable
            things but they are all as clever
            to me as they can bee) george
            has lots of fun about their calling
            me lady whitman the family
            that has come in up stairs has
            five children but i think she
            is very clean woman and
            the children seems orderly
            but they have to run up and
            down so there is some noise
            i told george yesterday
            i wasent going any where
            to look at any more houses
            but was going to wait for
            something to turn up i am
            quite lame in one of my
            knees i dont know what
            makes it so it pains me
            considerable i suppose it
            
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00543.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00543.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00543.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                must be the rheumatism
           settled there) sometimes i can
           hardly walk and then it will
           be better to day it feels quite 
           bad on account perhaps of the 
           appearance of a storm)</p>
            
           <p class="tei_p">i suppose the impeachment
           is draging to a close george
           thinks Bingams speech is
               splendid just his sentiments
           exactly he said at dinner
           time) i havent read it yet
           their speeches is so long i hope
           this will not be so lengthy as
           the others poor old man i wonder
           how he feels it will be rather
           sad if he is convicted for all i
           suppose he hasent done right
           i see in the papers if he leaves
           he will be esscorted through
           the citys) walter you must have
           congratulations from all quarters
           poor old alcot
               he must be very
           old seems to me) you remember
           walt that sunday morning we
               couldent have him)</p>
