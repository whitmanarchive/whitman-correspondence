                    1880, informed Whitman of Stedman's difficulties in getting his article printed
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's Monthly</span> over the objections of Holland, the
                    editor, and observed: "The article is candid &amp; respectful &amp; that is all
                    we can ask. . . . it seems to me that the adverse criticisms in the paper are
                    all weak &amp; ineffectual, &amp; that he is truly at home only when he is
                    appreciative. How gingerly he does walk at times to be sure, as if he feared the
                    ground underfoot was mined" (T.E. Hanley Collection, University of Texas).
                    Interestingly, Whitman did not comment on the following passage in Burroughs's
                    letter: "Dr Bucke is a good fellow, but between me &amp; you, I am a little shy
                    of him: I fear he lacks balance &amp; proportion &amp; that his book will not be
                    pitched in the right key. But I hope I do him injustice." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
