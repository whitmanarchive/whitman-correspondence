                here—it is as we tho't the enlarged prostrate gland incident is
                senilia—A short visit not much talk—Wharton was very good—what
                gravity there may be in it time &amp;c will show—At present it causes me any
                am't of annoyance &amp; sometimes severe continued pain—Last night was kind of
                half and half—had some sleep—have had my supper (some rice pudding,
                stew'd apple, &amp; a cup of tea)—</p>

                want you to have three or four copies at once—&amp; I shall decide whether to

                but it got left out "Sands at Seventy"—No word yet

                to reach up with you ab't four days yet—(nothing
                of any acc't)—poor Kennedy works like a house a
                fire—sends me a letter occasionally—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span> paper regular—Mild &amp; pleasant here—I am sitting
                in the room alone finishing this—</p>
