            <p class="tei_p">From to-day I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis that first affected me nearly
                ten years ago, has since remain'd, with varying course—seems to have settled
                quietly down, and will probably continue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk
                far; but my spirits are first-rate. I go around in public almost every day—now
                and then take long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles—live largely
                in the open air—am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)—keep up my activity
                and interest in life, people, progress, and the questions of the day. About
                two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality I ever had remains
                entirely unaffected; though physically I am a half-paralytic; and likely to be so,
                long as I live. But the principal object of my life seems to have been
                accomplish'd—I have the most devoted and ardent of friends, and affectionate
                relatives—and of enemies I really make no account.</p>
