            <p class="tei_p">From to-day I enter upon my 64th year. The paralysis that first affected me nearly
                ten years ago, has since remain'd, with varying course—seems to have settled
                quietly down, and will probably continue. I easily tire, am very clumsy, cannot walk
                far; but my spirits are first-rate. I go around in public almost every day—now
                and then take long trips, by railroad or boat, hundreds of miles—live largely
                in the open air—am sunburnt and stout, (weigh 190)—keep up my activity
                and interest in life, people, progress, and the questions of the day. About
                two-thirds of the time I am quite comfortable. What mentality I ever had remains
                entirely unaffected; though physically I am a half-paralytic; and likely to be so,
                long as I live. But the principal object of my life seems to have been
                accomplish'd—I have the most devoted and ardent of friends, and affectionate
                relatives—and of enemies I really make no account.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>

                    Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) provides a clue to the
                    identification of this person whom Whitman called in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                        Days</span> "a German Friend." However, in his letter of <a href="uva.00445">November 15, 1882</a>, Whitman called the letter to
                    Knortz's attention. Knortz (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the
                    U. S. in 1863. He was the author of many books and articles on German-American
                    affairs and was superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from
                    1892 to 1905. See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The American-German Review</span>, 8
                    (December, 1946), 27–30. Knortz's first published criticism of Whitman
                    appeared in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</span> on
                    December 17, 1882. In 1883, Knortz was living in New York City. In his letters
                    to Whitman that year Knortz frequently included "German renderings" of poems in
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Later he assisted Thomas W. H.
                    Rolleston in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Grashalme</span> (Zurich, 1889), which "marks the
                    real beginning of Whitman's influence" in Germany (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
