                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">As you see by the date, &amp;c. I am home, on a visit to my mother &amp; the rest.
                Mother is about as well as usual—has occasionally some trouble with
                rheumatism, but is cheerful &amp; keeps up amazingly. We speak of you every day,
                &amp; I have to give minute particulars of you, William, little Jenny, &amp; all. My
                brother George is very well, looks hearty &amp; brown as ever—much like he
                used to, only more serious—Jeff is at St. Louis, on the Water Works. Martha
                &amp; the little girls are well—they are here in Brooklyn, occupying temporary
                apartments. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am well as usual, &amp; go daily around New York &amp; Brooklyn yet with interest,
                of course—but I find the places &amp; crowds &amp; excitements—Broadway,
                &amp;c—have not the zest of former times—they have done their work,
                &amp; now they are to me as a tale that is told—Only the majestic &amp; moving
                river &amp; rapid sea-water scenery &amp; life about the islands, N. Y. and
                Brooklyn, tower into larger proportions than ever. I doubt if the world elsewhere
                has their equal, or could have, to me—The waters about New York &amp; west end
                of Long-Island are real sea-waters, &amp; are ever-rolling &amp; rushing in or
                out—never placid, never calm—surely they please this uneasy spirit, Me,
                that ebbs &amp; flows too all the while, yet gets nowhere, &amp; amounts to
                nothing—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am trying to write a piece, to be called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span>, for the
                leading article in the December or January number of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>—in some sort a counterblast or rejoinder to Carlyle's late
                piece, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Shooting Niagara</span><a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a>, which you must have read, or at least
                heard about. Mr. Church<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">3</a> strongly wishes it written. Mother &amp; Martha send love, &amp; I also,
                most truly—I shall probably return to Washington last of the week.</p>

                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New

                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
