        <span class="tei_salute">Edward Dowden, </span>
<span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your kind letter of April 16 reach'd me yesterday—I find it full of animation &amp; cheer, with items 
        of news, &amp;c. interesting to me, &amp; only hope to get letters from you oftener. In my condition they 
        are trebly welcome. My tedious prostration continues—primarily and mainly an obstinate &amp; baffling
        cerebral affection, on which have been superinduced grave lesions of the stomach &amp; liver, (from the 
        enforced physical inaction of the last twenty-eight months)—Still I am up &amp; dressed &amp; around every day,
        go out, walk a little, (as I am crippled, left leg, quite badly) but eke out a jaunt with the horse cars, &amp;
        the ferry boats on the noble river here, the Delaware—all quite handy—the solution of the problem of recovery, 
        (even partial) is more or less uncertain, but of course I like to proceed on the supposition or assumption
        that I shall get better.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Yes, I shall, unless prevented, bring out a volume this summer, partly as my contribution to our National
        Centennial. It is to be called "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span>"—(i.e. two flowing chains of prose
        and verse, emanating the real and ideal) it will embody much that I had previously written &amp; that you know,
        but about one third, as I guess, that is fresh. "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>," proper, will remain
        as it is identically—The new Vol. will have nearly or quite as much matter as L. of G. (It is a sort of omnibus,
        in which I have packed all the belated ones, since the outset of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>.)<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">1</a>
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">As I was writing to John Burroughs to day, I have enclosed to him your letter of 16th.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> His address is, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Esopus, Ulster Co. New York.</span> He is there permanently, having built himself a
        stone cottage in a beautiful spot on the banks of the Hudson, 60 miles north of New York City. He comes to see me—was
        here, well, about three weeks ago. I heard from Tennyson last summer, had a good friendly letter from him.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> I have just had a long, capital &amp; most kind letter from W. M. Rossetti. Thanks for the
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Shakspere</span>—the first &amp; second chapters I have read thoroughly—they are very
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">live</span>—I shall read it all &amp; write to you—the Contemporary Review is rec'd—thanks—<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a>
      </p>

        <p class="tei_p">Thanks for Mr. Clifton's letter—best remembrances to Mrs. Dowden—not forgetting the dear little daughter &amp; baby—</p>

                    and affectionately and manfully." Dowden also had received about the same time a
                    letter from Burroughs: "A deep alarm possesses Burroughs about Whitman's state
                    of health (he says W. is so inexpressibly dear to him, the earth would seem
                    hardly inhabitable without him.)" See Dowden's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fragments of
