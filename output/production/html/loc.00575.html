                    (1814–1875) Jr., was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp
                    most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan.
                    Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>
                    in 1858, was instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity; over
                    twenty items on Whitman appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> before the
                    periodical folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace
                    Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know
                    all about me." (For Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.60.html">Sunday, May 27, 1888</a>.") </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00575_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00575_n4"><span>The review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> that appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New-York Saturday Press</span> on June 2, 1860, was signed "Juliette H.
                    Beach," but it had really been written by her husband, Calvin Beach. Expecting a
                    favorable response, the editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>,
                    Henry Clapp, Jr., had forwarded a copy of Whitman's book to Juliette Beach for
                    review. Her husband, however, angered that Clapp had sent the book to his wife,
                    appropriated it and wrote a scathing review, which was published in his wife's
                    name. In a letter to Clapp dated June 7, 1860, Juliette Beach explained the
                    nature of the mistake and expressed her regret at not having had the opportunity
                    to publish her own favorable opinion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.
                    In an attempt to undo some of the damage, Clapp printed a notice titled
                    "Correction" in the subsequent issue of his newspaper, alongside three positive
                    commentaries on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> by women. For Calvin
