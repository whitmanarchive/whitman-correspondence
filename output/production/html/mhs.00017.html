            <p class="tei_p">I have been quite unwell, a bad spell with my head, worse than usual, nine or ten
                days—I kept up, but had no comfort—the last two days it is easier, &amp;
                it is passing over apparently, for the present—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Lou I think I would like to have you or George put up my letters (not the books or
                papers) in a package, &amp; send them to me here, 2316 Pine street,—if it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​

                be 6 cts an ounce by mail)—(or if George thinks best, send by

                here perhaps two weeks longer—It is very hot here for this season, indeed as

                taken me out riding very often, &amp; I have been everywhere within several miles,
                &amp; in all the outer parts of the City which are the roomiest &amp; the

                &amp; I am agreeably fixed here—&amp; since I am here so far, &amp; shall
                probably never come again, I have concluded to stay awhile—The girls are well

                face, all the time, night &amp; day—So you see there are always some bad
                points, even to the greatest &amp; best—But the folks here don't seem to mind
