                    written a letter to Whitman, in which she expressed her concern that her husband
                    Charles (ca. 1820–1892) had written with negative things to say about her.
                    She insisted that he "cannot or does not say <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">one word of
                        truth</span>." Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitman family for his
