            <p class="tei_p">Ab't the same as usual with me—Few or no visitors—have been reading
                    Pepys &amp; Lewes's Goethe papers—A letter from John Burroughs yesterday—he
                inquires particularly for you—he is at West Park again—I have just
                written to C W E[ldridge] &amp; sent him a bundle of papers. My
                canary is singing loud &amp; fast, as I write—Cloudy half-dripping weather,
                promising cold—clear skies I think before night—as I sit here by the
                window—</p>
