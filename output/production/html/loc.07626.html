            <p class="tei_p">Well Maurice every thing here goes on much the same, &amp; fairly enough—As I
                write it is abt <span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1889-05-25">1 pm, Saturday</span>, clear but not sunny &amp; neither cool nor
                warm—I have just had a midday currying—partial bowel action two hours
                ago—feel middling (but cold in the head, or catarrh or gathering or whatever
                it is yet)—get out a little in the wheel chair—they are all going out
                Mrs. D and all to an East Indian ship for two or three hours this
                afternoon—I told Ed to go too as he was invited, (&amp; he will go)—the
                ship is here from Bombay, &amp; our sailor boys know some of their sailors—We
                broke a big bottle of good wine yesterday &amp; all of us (seven—me at the
                head) drank health &amp; respects to Queen Victoria—(it was her birth day you
                know—)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—My big dinner (wh' however I shall probably not eat, and only be there a few minutes
                if at all) is coming on swimmingly they say—Herbert Gilchrist is to make the
                responsive speech to the British toast to friends—Col. Ingersoll's coming is
                uncertain—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> Howells nor Burroughs nor Aldrich
                nor Kennedy to be here—no word yet fr'm Stedman (Achilles laid up in his tent
                moody, am rather sorry but not to blame)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1889-05-25">Night—9½</span>—Have been out twice to day in the wheel-chair—short
                excursions—T B H has been here this evn'g—150 dinner tickets
                taken now—y'r letter rec'd by H—(I have not seen it
                yet)—coolish temperature three days &amp; now stopping sweat exudation &amp;
                somewhat bad for me but well enough as I sit here alone every thing quiet, but some
                sailors from the ship down stairs</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1889-05-26"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Sunday</span></span>

                A clouded rather rawish day—Am going up to my friends Mr &amp; Mrs: Harned's in
                an hour, in my wheel chair—to stay a few minutes &amp; probably get a drink of
                champagne—(of which H always has the best &amp; treats me to
                galore)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Havn't now had such a tipple for a year.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Nothing particular to write—my head is a little heavy &amp;
                thick—no pocket-book copies yet, but I count on them in a couple of
                days—All goes fairly as c'd be expected—</p>
