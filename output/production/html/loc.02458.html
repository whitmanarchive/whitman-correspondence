                <span class="tei_salute">My dear old friend,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was greatly pleased at receiving your kind post card of Dec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> this morning &amp;
                I thank you most cordially for it &amp; for the thoughtful consideration which
                prompted you to write it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was extremely sorry to learn from it, though, that there was then so little real
                improvement in y<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> physical condition—"health points
                much the same, (not favourable)," so says the p.c.—but I am glad to know that
                you were in "fair spirits" &amp; able to sit up &amp; "write a little."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My best thanks to you, too, for your kind offer to "send, or notify" me of, any thing
                you may write</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish from the bottom of my heart that I could do something to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">really</span> help you; &amp; it grieves me to think how powerless I am; for I
                can do nothing but write to you &amp; try to shew  you something of a personal affection for you which is almost filial in
                its intensity &amp; of the gratitude with which my heart is filled to overflowing,
                for all your great &amp; countless benefactions to me.</p>

                husband's story, "The Brazen Android," is to appear in
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Atlantic Monthly</span> for April &amp; May &amp; the volume
                containing all the seven stories later.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have also had a friendly &amp; affectionate letter from John Burroughs in wh: he says that he is pleased with the pamphlet, &amp;
                compliments me upon my sketch of you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you a Bolton paper containing an account of a serious railway collision to

            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a par., cut from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Family Herald</span> (London), in which your name occurs. It shews that you have a reader on the staff of that paper.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope, when this reaches you, that you will be freed from the ailments which have
                troubled you for so long or at least that you may be relieved from the pain &amp;
                able to enjoy your life in comparative comfort.</p>
