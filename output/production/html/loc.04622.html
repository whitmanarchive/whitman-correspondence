            <p class="tei_p"> I received the book quite safely this morning,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> &amp;
                thank you very much for sending it, it was a very good thought of Edward
                    Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">2</a> to ask you to send it to me, &amp; just like him
                to know how pleased I should be to receive it from your own hands. I do indeed feel
                proud to have it direct from the Author, &amp; to have my name written in it by
                himself. I should like to take this opportunity if you will allow me, of thanking
                you for all the help I have <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_3">[illegible]</span>

                from your books. You do not know me, I have never spoken one word to you til to-day,
                but I know you. You have spoken to me many words of help, &amp; encouragement &amp;
                reproof, &amp; direction, &amp; of all kinds &amp; I feel very grateful to you for
                them, &amp; for all the pleasure I have had in reading your books, &amp; I shall always be
                grateful to Mr Carpenter also, for introducing them to me. They contain messages for
                all times &amp; people, &amp; for all sorts &amp; conditions of men, but it seems to
                me they are especially good &amp; most glad tidings to common place,
                ordinary plain people, with few gifts

                often think of these words of yours, "Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as
                the well off just as much as you Each has his or her place in the procession." I
                shall never forget how struck I was with the truth &amp; beauty of verses 16 17 &amp; 18 on page 105 in Leaves of
                Grass the first time I read them, it so often <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">came</span> to me as I <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ef tei_unclear_cert_medium">go</span> about amongst the sick &amp; poor, especially the poor in the Workhouse Hospital.

                worked hard much too hard as their bent backs declare, all their lives. There is something
                very very wrong somewhere &amp; we shall have to answer for it in one way or
                another, but I will not trouble you with more words of mine. Forgive me writing so
                much. I did not intend when I began. I should like to send the money for the book
                &amp; the postage, but I do not know the price of the book. Will you kindly send me
                the price on a post card. Again thanking you I am </p>

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
