                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in

                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and

                    Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
                    ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
                    daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
                    to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,

                    assisted in nursing him. In his early Washington years, Whitman lived with
                    William D. and Nelly O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John
                    Burroughs, were to remain his close associates. Before marrying William
                    O'Connor, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery movement and women's rights
                    movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a
                    women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Nelly had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
