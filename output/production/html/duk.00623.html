            i like them very much i should think
            they would be a sucsess i am in hopes
            walter dear you will soon be well
            again i am pretty well at any rate
            i work around full as much as i want
            to but of course its slow but i dont get
            much credit for it) but i dont care for
                that Lou s aunt is staying here at present
            she appears a clever woman but the best of
            it we have better grub as a general thing
            we live pretty saving but i suppose its
            all right i havent heard from Jeff
            in a long time) i wish walt you would
            send we an envelope directed to Jeff
            i get letters from hat<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">tee</span> the last one she
            wrote said her father had been to kansas
            city
            but had returned (i suppos they get along
                pretty well in their boarding place but
            there is no place like your own home

            i hope when the girls get older so they can
            take the charge of a house jeff will keep hous
            again i suppose as things was it was the
            only thing he could doo) i think walt when 
            folks get old like you and me they ought
            to have a home of their own but i try to be
            contented as i might be much worse off
            i have many little things to put up with
            but we all have our annoyances some one
            way and some another) george is good
            enoughf to me but he thinks and its all right
            he should that every thing Lou does is all
            right) george aint like to get the brookly
            work 
            at present and that is a great
            disappointment george is a good man but
            i dont think i ever saw any one so change<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">d</span>
            he used to be so generous and free but
            now he is very saving never goes out any
            where) so we go walter dear only try
                to get well once more)
