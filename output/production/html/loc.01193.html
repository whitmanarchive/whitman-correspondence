                before I thought of going into book business. He had much more shelving than he
                could use without it. In fact had some lying away entirely unused—I urged that
                it was his interest to pay you entire &amp; secure your new book then announced,
                &amp;c &amp;c To make a long story short I used every inducement to make him pay the
                debts but he either shuffled, evaded or refused to do any thing. I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="bought​ ">bo't</span>​  one of the claims under his solemn promise to give me $25— towards
                it on a certain day in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="December​ ">Dec.</span>​ . He utterly refused to let me have any money or even books which were mine
                under exemption laws had I elected to call them so. Since then I have not spoken to
                him or he to me. One of the creditors is now prosecuting him. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> paying lawyers fees. His defense is a lie.</p>
