                I send you a cheering review of Hosnett's book from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span>. So far I have not been able
                to find the book here, but will continue the search. It appears to give you great rank, and prefigures big future verdicts.

                I got your letter of last May, but have not been well able to write with my half-paralyzed hands and moribund head. My little book overwhelmed

                I had a letter from Dr Bucke recently, which I will try to answer soon. I was glad he had such a good time.

                Donnelly promised to have his book out this June, but I guess the decipheration process was more laborious 
                than he had reckoned. My faith is not shaken.

                Life seems to have almost stopped still with me. I earnestly wish I could get well, or else

                I hope you have stood the summer fairly well. It has been, lasting three or four days, pretty comfortable, and

                   up to Canada this summer? Charley Eldridge intends leaving here for the North on a trip Saturday, and wanted to stop to see you at Camden, but
                   doubts whether he should find you there.

                a memoir of her, which is nearly completed.
