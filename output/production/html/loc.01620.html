                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Sir,</span>  
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Some years ago when I had occasion to address you, you were so good as to say you should be happy 
                to hear from me again; and as my admiration of your works and interest in whatever concerns you 
                have rather strengthened than weakened, I feel sure you will not mind my asking one or two questions.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">As a faithful student of your books, I have made it my business to obtain every edition I could, 
                and all portraits and notable 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01620.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                notable accounts and criticisms. But there is one edition in particular which I have never been able 
                to see even,—that mentioned by Rossetti as having been issued in 
                1856 in 16 mo.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>The American 
                agent to whom my last application for this was forwarded says: "I don't think there is an 1856 edition. 
                There is one earlier or later in great demand, and at a high price, something like 25$ to 30$; 
                but I can't find that. There was a copy auctioned the other night at something like the above".</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Can you tell me whether there is or is not an edition between the 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01620.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                the one set up by yourself in 1855 and that of Thayer &amp; Eldridge 
                dated 1860–61? If there is, can you give me any particulars that will help me towards buying 
                it? Also, what is the edition that fetches 25$ to 30$? Not that of 1855; for I hear that 
                can be had for 3 or 4.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">When at my friend Mr W.B. Scott's a few weeks ago, I saw a proof of a fine portrait 
                of you engraved by Linton: may I ask what it is from, and where it is published?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I live in hopes of publishing some day a good English Edition of your works; and my enquiries about editions 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01620.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                editions are not mere bibliomania. I find they vary considerably; and my experience is that the careful 
                collations of various versions of a poet's work is often a key as well as an incitement to the right 
                understanding of his spirit and intent.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am at present engaged on an edition of Shelley which will be the handsomest 
                in form, and the most extensive in matter (I hope), yet published; and that takes up most of my time.</p>
