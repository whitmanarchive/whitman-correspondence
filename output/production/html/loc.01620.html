            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Some years ago when I had occasion to address you, you were so good as to say you should be happy 
                to hear from me again; and as my admiration of your works and interest in whatever concerns you 
                have rather strengthened than weakened, I feel sure you will not mind my asking one or two questions.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">As a faithful student of your books, I have made it my business to obtain every edition I could, 
                and all portraits and notable

                notable accounts and criticisms. But there is one edition in particular which I have never been able 
                to see even,—that mentioned by Rossetti<a href="#n0522" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0522">2</a> as having been issued in 
                1856<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> in 16 mo.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>The American 
                agent to whom my last application for this was forwarded says: "I don't think there is an 1856 edition. 
                There is one earlier or later in great demand, and at a high price, something like 25$ to 30$; 
                but I can't find that. There was a copy auctioned the other night at something like the above".</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Can you tell me whether there is or is not an edition between the

                dated 1860–61? If there is, can you give me any particulars that will help me towards buying 
                it? Also, what is the edition that fetches 25$ to 30$? Not that of 1855; for I hear that 
                can be had for 3 or 4.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">When at my friend Mr W.B. Scott's<a href="#n0547" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0547">6</a> a few weeks ago, I saw a proof of a fine portrait 
                of you engraved by Linton:<a href="#n0360" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0360">7</a> may I ask what it is from, and where it is published?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I live in hopes of publishing some day a good English Edition of your works; and my enquiries about editions 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01620.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01620.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01620.004_large.jpg</span> 
                editions are not mere bibliomania. I find they vary considerably; and my experience is that the careful 
                collations of various versions of a poet's work is often a key as well as an incitement to the right 
                understanding of his spirit and intent.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am at present engaged on an edition of Shelley<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">8</a> which will be the handsomest 
                in form, and the most extensive in matter (I hope), yet published; and that takes up most of my time.</p>

                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
