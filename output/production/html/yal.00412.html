      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been down stairs, &amp; out on the street this afternoon—it is such fine
        weather, (after the bad storm of yesterday)—I got along very slowly, &amp; didn't go
        far—but it was a great thing after being kept in for over three weeks—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd a short letter from Jeff again to-day, dated 13th—nothing different with Mat—I rec'd your letter Saturday—I hope now to
        improve in walking—&amp; then I shall begin to feel all right—(but am still very
        feeble &amp; slow)—Peter Doyle &amp; another friend accompanied me out—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Mother, I hope this will find you feeling well—Love to all—</p>
