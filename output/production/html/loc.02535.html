                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and

                    was a British poet and journalist best known for his long narrative poem, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> (1879), which tells the life story and
                    philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely responsible for introducing
                    Buddhism to Western audiences. Arnold visited Whitman in Camden in 1889. For an
                    account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt

                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering," Whitman
                    concluded. Arnold published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and Lands</span> (1891), in which he averred that the two
                    read from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis,
                    knitting, a handsome young man (Ned Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at
