        <span class="tei_salute">My dear Rudolf Schmidt,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">My lonesomeness &amp; sickness here, (for I am still sick, &amp; here,) have been much
        rejoiced to–day by my getting your good &amp; copious letter of 28th February, on your return to Kopenhagen. I rec'd with it the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fatherland</span> with Mr. Rosenberg's criticism—which (perhaps luckily for
        me) I cannot now read—but will one of these days have translated &amp; read to me. I
        keep it very carefully—as I do all you send me—&amp; shall yet read and commune
        with, &amp; dwell upon &amp; absorb <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> thoroughly &amp; at
        leisure—(especially your own review in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ide</span>.) I think
        probably <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span>—certainly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">most</span>—papers, sheets, &amp;c. you have sent me to Washington, have reached me
        here—the post office forwards them here—I rec'd two complete copies <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Demokratiske Fremblik</span>, &amp; one copy in sheets—also three copies picture paper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Folkeblad</span>, with my portrait, which is most
        excellent—(and the notice I will have read to me)—I rec'd at the time, a year
        ago, the translation of Swedish and Norwegian poems, you sent me, acknowledged it, but the
        letter seems to have missed you, &amp; have read it &amp; had much pleasure, &amp; am to
        read it more—I also rec'd from Clausen your picture, which I have with me—&amp;
        prize. A friend lately looking at it said, "Why, he looks like a born Yankee—&amp; of
        the best." </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote you March 4th, acknowledging <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Demokratiske Fremblik</span>, &amp;
        sent you (one in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Magazine</span>, &amp; one extracted in the N. Y.
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>) my two latest pieces <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Song of the Redwood
          Tree</span>, (California,) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Prayer of Columbus</span>, which I suppose
        you have rec'd all—For the last ten weeks I have not felt inclined to write—have
        suffered in the head—walk hardly any, (from the paralysis,) but maintain good spirits,
        keep up in body &amp; face, (my brother &amp; sister said at dinner yesterday that portrait
        in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Folkeblad</span> looks greatly like me now, &amp; has caught the true
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">expression</span> better than any of them.) In body I have always been,
        &amp; still remain, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">stout</span>, in the American sense, (i.e. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> corpulent)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In my letter of March 4 I wrote a few lines about Clemens Petersen—my only interview with him was about 40 minutes, one very
        rainy Sunday, nearly two years since in New York—he was just recovering from an attack
        of erysipelas which had left large red blotches on his face—two other visitors were
        just leaving—C. P. received me very kindly &amp; talked well—all was agreeable,
        but under the circumstances I could not say much nor stay long—received a pleasing but
        passing, &amp; not very pronounced impression—which is the reason, my dear friend,
        that I have not written more fully—Partly too I have been waiting expecting that
        perhaps somehow C. P. and I would meet again, &amp; talk more &amp; get better acquainted,
        &amp; I could write you further—but I have not seen any thing of him since—&amp;
        only seen some of his pieces casually in the magazines. I have not heard him or them
        mentioned here in America—certainly no essay in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span>
        magazine nor any thing of his elsewhere in English that I have seen has attracted any
        special attention nor deserves it—shows nothing of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">forte</span> or
        heartiness of which I have no doubt he is capable—(I think your letter &amp; opinion
        of C. P.'s essay, of last summer, have missed me.)—I cannot understand your allusions
        to Bjornson—as you will be doubtless aware yourself. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">The same <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hardness</span>, crudeness, worldliness—absence of the
        spiritual, the purely moral, esthetik, &amp;c—are in Democracy here too—(though there are signs &amp;
        awakenings here very plain to me)—probably in Great Britain, &amp; in Europe &amp;
          everywhere—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Here</span>, it is much counterbalanced &amp; made up by
        an immense &amp; general basis of the eligibility to manly &amp; loving comradeship, very
        marked in American young men—but generally, I am the more disposed to be satisfied
        with the case as it is because I see that the only foundations &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sine
          qua non</span> of popular improvement &amp; Democracy are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">worldly &amp;
          material success established first</span>, spreading &amp; intertwining everywhere—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">then</span> only, but then surely for the masses, will come spiritual
        cultivation &amp; art—they will then firmly assert themselves—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Thank you for the graphic line–sketch you write of Bismark, in your letter. My own
        opinion is, that we can well afford—I will say, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">such as you &amp;
          I</span>, can well afford, to let those little &amp; great <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">chunks of
          brawn</span>—Attilas, Napoleons, Bismarks—prepare the way, &amp; cut the roads
        through, for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">us</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Write me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span>, till further notice—let me hear what is said
        about <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Vistas</span> or my poems—let me hear always of yourself fully. </p>
