            <p class="tei_p">Again I am ashamed of myself for not writing to you before as I have received so many
                letters from you and always think I will answer but one thing and another keeps me
                from it so now I will try to tell you about myself well we jog along in about the
                old way sometimes it is nip and tuck with us sometimes nips ahead and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">sometimees​ </span></span> tuck but in the main we are all right as long as I only have my health
                Ansel has been out of work for a year but has work now so we are all right I often
                hear from you through the papers and am glad enough to think you are better this
                winter <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk_am.00299_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk_am.00299_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk_am.00299_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">duk_am.00299_large.jpg</span> and hope

                living in it Minnie's husband has bought one a little further off and they are
                living in that. I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span></span> know as this will interest you but I thought I would just write it. I feel
                myself growing old and failing every day but my health has been better this winter
                than usual</p>
