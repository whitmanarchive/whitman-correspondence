            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Again I am ashamed of myself for not writing to you before as I have received so many
                letters from you and always think I will answer but one thing and another keeps me
                from it so now I will try to tell you about myself well we jog along in about the
                old way sometimes it is nip and tuck with us sometimes nips ahead and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">sometimees​ </span><span class="tei_corr">sometimes​
        
      </span></span> tuck but in the main we are all right as long as I only have my health
                Ansel has been out of work for a year but has work now so we are all right I often
                hear from you through the papers and am glad enough to think you are better this
                winter <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk_am.00299_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk_am.00299_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk_am.00299_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and hope
                and pray you will entirely recover and believe you will and would like very much to
                see you whenever you feel as if you could come or any of the rest of my folks and
                will do all I can to make it pleasant for them Our family of children live here
                around us Minnie has three children and Fanny one the rest have none Greenport is
                about the same as it was when you was here only improved very much and now dear
                brother I want to thank you for the many letters cards and papers you have sent me
                and likewise for the christmas present you sent in the letter and want you to write
                whenever you can for you are the only one now since dear mother left us that ever

      </span></span> Jeff George and all get along as I should like to hear from them and I do
                think I will not be so long in answering again. I suppose you have almost forgotten
                how it looks here Louisa and John have built a new house opposite here and are
                living in it Minnie's husband has bought one a little further off and they are
                living in that. I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> know as this will interest you but I thought I would just write it. I feel
                myself growing old and failing every day but my health has been better this winter
                than usual</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Brother one more favor I would like to ask of you that is when you have time to
                please copy our family record and send to me <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk_am.00089_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk_am.00089_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk_am.00089_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> as I really have
