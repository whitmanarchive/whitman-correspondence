                    by Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke, who had come to Camden on May 25. See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> (ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1963], 236–237). On June 1 Whitman made a new will in
                    which he appointed George and his wife as executor and executrix. At the time he
                    had approximately $1000 in the Brooklyn Savings Bank and about $800 in
                    the National State Bank in Camden. He bequeathed four-sevenths of his estate to
                    Edward and one-seventh each to Mary Van Nostrand, Hannah Heyde, and his nieces,
                    Mannahatta and Jessie (Whitman House, Camden). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
