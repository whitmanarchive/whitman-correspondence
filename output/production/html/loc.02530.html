                Arm in arm the dear good fellow &amp; I walked down the street; &amp; then

                After tea Will Law came in from Liverpool &amp; at 7 p.m. 
                we all made our way to the house of W.A.
                Ferguson who had kindly invited all the boys there 
                to give Wallace our Reception upon his return from America. 
                There was a good muster, those present being:—J.W. Wallace,

                 After the bustle &amp; excitement of mutual greetings &amp;c were over 
                 J.W. Wallace opened his bag &amp; distributed the various presents
                 he had brought with him for the boys—something for each &amp;

                But the pick of the good things fell to my lot—a copy of

            <p class="tei_p">Last Sunday night I went to St George's Church of wh F.R.C. Hutton is the vicar 
                when—it being Mayor's Sunday—he preached to the Mayor 
                &amp; corporation. At the conclusion of his sermon he gave a long 
                quotation from the "Song of the Universal" mentioning you by name.
                Several of the boys were there &amp; it was a pleasant experience 
                for us to hear you quoted from the pulpit of one of the principal churches
                in the town of Bolton—the first fruits of your great harvest.</p>

                time to give him the details of our proceedings I would like you to show this letter
