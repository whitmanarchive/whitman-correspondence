                I get a pretty full acc't of the Bolton visit. I am getting on abt same as ever. 
                Y'rs and dear J. W. W[allace]'s 
                letters help to cheer me up. I send best regards to Geo. Humphries
                (if you say so I will send him a copy of L. of G.) 
                Have you rec'd the tomb photos? 
                Its best investment—vines creepers &amp;c.—are 
                yet to come. Cooler and more endurable—a g't let off on me. Love to you &amp; J. W. W. and all.
