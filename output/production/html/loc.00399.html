                  <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt,</span>
               </span>
               <p class="tei_p">I mailed a letter to you either last Friday or Saturday, containing $11. 10 from Hill &amp; Newman and $1. from Henry Carlow  On Tuesday I again wrote you, sending you $4…$2 from Theo. A. Drake and 2 from "Cash" through John D. Martin<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>  The enclosed $5 is from our friend Mr. E. Rae.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> He gave it to me last night   I left him a couple of letters to read and I want you to write him one of the same kind of letters asking him to show it to some of his friends and if they have anything to devote to the purpose for him to send it directly to you or through me. Walt, I know Rae is a liberal hearted man and through his friends he could do a great deal and I am confident that he could be more earnestly interested in the matter if you write him directly. Please acknowledge the receipt of this and the others (if received) so that I may be positive that the money is reaching you. Ive no doubt we shall keep dribbling along, a few dollars at a time, for some time yet.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">We are all about the same at home as when I last wrote. Mother is of course quite worried about the moving of the 9th Army Corps and very much disappointed that George will not have an opportunity to come home and see us.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> We are all getting well of our colds, last night Mother had a very bad sore throat but I made her some "hot stuff" and she was much better this morning. Mat and Sis have nearly recovered and are all right I guess. In George's letter he speaks of wanting $20. We think of sending it to him by Capt. Simms,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> who is now here, and I think it will be the better and safer way.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I am really much disappointed that George should have to go in the thickest of the danger. I certainly feel that he is doing wrong if there is any possible way for him to avoid it. However I try to put as good a face on the matter as possible and sincerely hope for the best  Tis too bad that he should just have got his hut done and then have to go away and leave it.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
               </p>
               <p class="tei_p">How goes matters with you Walt? Mr Lane<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> will send you the letters I spoke of in a day or two. I wish you could make it so that you could visit George before they leave Fortress Monroe  Do if you possibly can. I am having a plan for a small 2 Story house (22 x 32) made and shall try to get Rae to build it for me. the only question that I am not clear on and am wanting advice is the position that I shall put on the lot, front or rear. I have almost made up my mind to set it so that a 65 or 70 x 20 foot lot can at any time be made in front, and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">only</span> objection to placing it in that position is the location of the privy in the next yard, which in this case would be right abreast of the center of the house thus<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>  I do not fear that it would amount to anything unless 'twould damage the cellar in some manner. Unless I am convinced that it will be some damage <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">via</span> the

                  </span>
                  cellar I shall place it as above. Let me know what you think of it. (The above sketch is not at all in proportion, but may convey an idea to you what I mean)  The front lot will be quite ample, I think, (65 x 20) when you take in consideration that there will neither have to be a privy or cistern in the yard, and you will be able to have a gate in the ally which is quite an advantage. Mr Lane compliments me highly on my bargain and says I have done <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">well</span>. I hope I have but I am as ignorant about these matters as a baby. However I am bound to go through with it now, sink or tother thing.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Dear brother write me. If you see dear dear Brother George tell him how fondly we looked for his coming home and assure him that we were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> much, very much disappointed. All send their love to you and you may be assured you are never absent from our minds.</p>

Mr Lane sends his respects to you</p>
               <p class="tei_p">At Dinner time to-day Mother told me that Andrew had been discharged from the yard. Tis too bad but I presume it is on account of his not being there much of the time. I hardly know what Nancy<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> is to do with her two children.</p>

                    identified. Henry P. Hill, James Hill, and Warren Hill were engineers; Simon
                    Hill, Samuel Hill, and Thomas Newman were contractors. Henry Carlow, an
                    engineer, is listed in the Brooklyn directory for 1859–60, but not in the
                    subsequent years. Theodore A. Drake was a waterworks inspector and John D.
                    Martin an engineer. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00399_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00399_n2"><span>Edwin Haviland Miller
                    reads this as "Rae" (Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:78, n46), but Jerome M.
                    Loving reads this as "Rac" (Loving, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters of
                        George Washington Whitman</span> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975],
                    71, n7). We agree with Miller and believe Jeff refers to Edmund H. Rae, a notary
                    and copyist who lived in Brooklyn but kept offices at 13 Wall Street, New York
                    City. It is not clear why Jeff would consider having Rae build his house. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00399_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00399_n3"><span>General Ambrose

                    unsuccessful attempt to capture Fredericksburg.

Sims, a
                    captain in George Washington Whitman's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment,
                    had been the subject in part of Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in
                    the War," which appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, on
                    January 5, 1863. Sims died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg,
                    Virginia (see George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    from <a href="duk.00359">August 9, 1864</a>). Walt Whitman may have lived
                    in Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
                    Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
                    brother's name in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> listed among the
                    wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
                    George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
                        <a href="duk.00333">December 16, 1862</a>: "I have come out safe and
                    sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
                    which burst at my feet." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00399_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00399_n5"><span>On <a href="duk.00336">February 1, 1863</a>, Geroge wrote to Walt Whitman: "I

                    after I had cut the logs...orders came for us to be ready to move the next day

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27,
                        1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in
                    the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman
                    wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of
                    money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
                    (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
                    Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00399_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00399_n7"><span>Jeff's sketch occurs

                    Moses Lane wrote to E. D. Webster: "Mr. W. has been for a long time connected
                    with the New York Press and is a writer of most decided ability. His patriotism
                    and loyalty you can rely upon under all circumstances" (Charles E. Feinberg

                    assumed that Nancy was Andrew Whitman's common-law wife. However, on September
                    22, 1852, Hannah wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman: "tell me who Andrew is
                    reported to be married to" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University
                    Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). It seems more likely
                    that this remark would have been prompted by a legal marriage rather than by a
                    common-law marriage. </span></span> [<a href="#r9">back</a>]</li></ul>
