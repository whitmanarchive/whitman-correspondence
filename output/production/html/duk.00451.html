                    the only members of the Whitman family to read and admire Whitman's writings.
                    She married Charles Heyde in 1852, and the couple lived in Burlington, Vermont.
                    Charles regularly disparaged his wife and her sometimes erratic behavior in his

                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
