                Han is not so well to day—but much cast down. Much disappointed, althought 
                appreciating her friends, Lou and Jessie's
                visit. She thinks as I do that they should have visited our home first and administered to its immediate urgent 
                necessities—taxes were due 24 dollars—which Han mentioned. On leaving Lou
                mentioned that Han should write to her, and she would send her all she needed.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Now Walt, we need money most—taxes—then 1 ton of coal, 1 cord of wood, which Lou promise to pay for—coal 
                6—wood 4—for a stove which was set up<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00451.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00451.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00451.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                for Han in winter, but for which there is scarcely any use, as I keep a heater all the winter going, pipe
                traversing upper rooms—.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                But Han is apprehensive and cast down—dread glooming her 25 years pleasant home.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Cannot something, money be raised to relieve us of this present pressure? It seems incredible that I could 
                have sustaind ourselves so long, with so little derived professionally.

            <p class="tei_p">
                Real estate inducements are advertised in Camden. I have written to the Agents—then Han would be near her family. 
                She often desires to be near you—living near You, Walt.
                She is cast down. No money was bestowed, our good true friend.
