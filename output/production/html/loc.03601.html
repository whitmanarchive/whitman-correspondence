                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet

                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
