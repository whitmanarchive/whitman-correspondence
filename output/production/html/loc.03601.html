            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received some little while ago your post-card of 3 May, &amp; felt obliged to you for having sent the books to Mr. Cozens, without waiting for actual receipt of the money—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​ , as before stated, is in my hands. The only reason why, contrary to my usual practice, I have so long delayed sending it on to you is that I have been looking out for any other stray subscriptions, promised but not yet paid, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="could​ ">c.<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span></span>​  be sent along with Mr. Cozens's in a Bank-order—or, if more convenient, a P.O. order. On receipt of your card (other such subscriptions not making their appearance

            at present) I was intending to send C's money at once by P.O. order; but then, some little while ago now, Minto, the Editor of The Examiner, started in talk with me, of his own accord, the subject of the money that he owes for your article, &amp; he proposed to send it round to me at once—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  of course I approved. This again made me hold over the dispatching of the P.O. order for C.s money, but as yet, after all, no symptom of Minto's remittance appears. One of these days C.'s money will be properly sent off to you—accompanied, let us hope, by some other, but if not then by itself. I enter into all these tiresome details because an explanation of my delay is due to you: but I fear you will think them quite as bothering as the delay itself.</p> 
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is a goodish while ago—

            say 6 weeks—that I wrote to Dowden in Dublin, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">enquiring​ </span><span class="tei_corr">inquiring​
        
      </span></span> about those subscribers who volunteered <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">thro​ </span><span class="tei_corr">through​
        
      </span></span> him (not holding any direct communication with me), &amp; who have not yet paid. Dowden has not yet replied to me: when he does so, it will behove me to look into the details of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> the outstanding subscriptions, &amp; get the affair finally closed.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Lately,—say 3 weeks ago—I received a letter from Australia, of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I enclose some extracts, along with the printed matter <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  accompanied it. I replied the other day, giving the writer Mr. Adams my last news of your health, &amp; enclosing also a copy of my last circular (summer of 1876) regarding your new editions—not without some hope that some few Australians here &amp; there may do themselves

            the good-service of ordering copies. Mr. A.'s wish for a copy of my "full Review" of you (as he terms it, meaning of course the introduction to the selection from your Poems <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I published in 1868) has been attended to—the Publishers sending him a copy [I hardly thought there was any remaining] of the book. The tone of his letter is agreeable to me, &amp; I hope it will be the same to you: his name had not previously been known to me.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Please remember me to M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs.</span> Gilchrist—or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span>, I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.<span class="supersrcipt tei_hi tei_hi_rend_supersrcipt">d</span></span>​  rather say. My wife received lately a letter from M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs.</span> G. to serve as an introduction for an American lady, M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs.</span> Edwards.

      </span></span> she thinks Philadelphia is anything but a favourable field for the painting career of Herbert.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have by me a note written long ago (6 Jan?) by Foote, Editor of The Secularist, to say that, before receiving my then last note on the subject, he had sent on to you direct the subscription-money in his hands. This, I suppose, is all right, within your cognizance.</p>

I never <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">met</span> Mr. O'Conor: but he has addressed me from time to time about his little vol. of poems, &amp; other such matters.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Not very long ago I received a letter from Mr. Marvin offering a prospect, rather more definite than hitherto, of your coming to look a little about you in England, &amp; perhaps on the European Continent. I can but repeat my delight in this prospect, were it to be realized, &amp; my wife's hope &amp; my own that you will not, in such case, fail to give
