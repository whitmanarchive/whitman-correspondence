            <p class="tei_p">I was indeed delighted to receive your kind p.c. of the 
                8th inst which, together with that to J.W.W &amp; the cablegram from H.L.T. greatly
                relieved our anxiety regarding you. I am very glad to learn that at the time of
                writing you seemed to be getting over your bad time—"a bad two months" &amp; I
                fondly hope that by this time the attack has passed off &amp; left you in
                comparative comfort</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Sorry to hear of Dr B's illness. Hope that he has now quite

                with us here much as usual—my time being chiefly occupied with my professional
                work, with, as you will see from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Bolton Journal</span> which
                I send you, an occasional social diversion.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">During the last three weeks my wife has been on the sick
                list—suffering from a rather severe attack of spasmodic bronchial catarrh
                &amp; neuralgia, which I am glad to say seem to be slowly subsiding now.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I presume you have recd the Feb No. of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Review of
                Reviews</span> containing a facsimile of one of your p.c's &amp; a portrait. I am
                sorry the latter is such an unsatisfactory one <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">&amp; I don't

                seems to be the only one that the London folks have of you. I thought of sending the editor of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Rev of Rev</span> (Mr Stead) a copy of the
                one you sent to J.W.W but he &amp; I think it best not to do so until after the
                publication of yr "2nd Annex" of which it will be one of the attractions.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have secured the copyright of that portrait in this country so that it cannot be
                reproduced without my permission.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Should you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wish</span> me to send a copy (?Notes as well) I will
                do so but not without your express desire or should you send him one perhaps you
                would kindly mention the fact of its <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aa tei_unclear_cert_low">having</span>
