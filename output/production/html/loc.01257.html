                    brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
                    scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
                    system. He was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on the Medical Applications

"Nelly" O'Connor
                    was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
                    staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
                    daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
                    time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
                    dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
                    often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
                    Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
                    1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
                    emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
