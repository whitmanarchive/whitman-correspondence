            <p class="tei_p">Though it is but a few days since I posted a letter my dearest friend, I must write you again—because I 
                cannot help it, my heart is so full—so full of love &amp; sorrow and struggle. The day before yesterday 
                I saw Mr. Conway's printed account of you &amp; instead of the cheerful report I 
                had been told of, he speaks of your having given up hope of recovery. Those words were like a sharp knife plunged 
                into me They choked me with bitter tears. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Don't​

                for the sake of those that so tenderly passionately love you—would give their lives with

                with joy for you. Why who knows better than you, how much hope &amp; the will have to do with it &amp; I know quite 
                well that the belief does not depress you—that you are ready to accept either lot with calmness, cheerfulness, 
                perfect faith, perhaps with equal joy. But for all that, it does you harm. Ideas always have a tendency to accomplish 
                themselves. And what right have the doctors to utter gloomy prophecies? The wisest of them know the best how 
                profoundly in the dark they are as to much that goes on within

                us, especially in maladies like yours. O cling to life with a resolute hold my beloved to bless us with your 
                presence unspeakably dear beneficent presence—me to taste of it before so very long now—thirsting 
                pining loving me. Take through these poor words of mine some breath of the tender 
                tender ineffable love that fills my heart and soul and body take of it to strengthen the very springs of your

                his own, I will come, I may not before, not if it should break my heart to stop away from you, for his welfare
