            <p class="tei_p">Though it is but a few days since I posted a letter my dearest friend, I must write you again—because I 
                cannot help it, my heart is so full—so full of love &amp; sorrow and struggle. The day before yesterday 
                I saw Mr. Conway's printed account of you<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> &amp; instead of the cheerful report I 
                had been told of, he speaks of your having given up hope of recovery. Those words were like a sharp knife plunged 
                into me They choked me with bitter tears. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Dont​ </span></span> give up that hope,</span> 
                for the sake of those that so tenderly passionately love you—would give their lives with

                with joy for you. Why who knows better than you, how much hope &amp; the will have to do with it &amp; I know quite 
                well that the belief does not depress you—that you are ready to accept either lot with calmness, cheerfulness, 
                perfect faith, perhaps with equal joy. But for all that, it does you harm. Ideas always have a tendency to accomplish 
                themselves. And what right have the doctors to utter gloomy prophecies? The wisest of them know the best how

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
