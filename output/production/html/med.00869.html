            <p class="tei_p">Am continuing on here much the same imprisoned in my room and chair and locomotion
                quite out of the question—mentality and brain action (while easily tired and
                sore at the best) remain, the muscles, especially my right hand and arm,
                good—spirits, sleep etc. fair—and the main elementary functions active
                at least half (or even plus half) to keep off so far my complete down fall.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I believe I told you I am preparing a small handsome pocket book bound edition of L.
                of G. including the "Sands at 70" and "Backward Glance," as a sort of commemorating
                my completion of 70th year (May 31, 1889). Shall send
                you a copy when out. Sarrazin's book is out in Paris—"La
                Renaissance de la Poésie Anglaise 1798–1889." Papers on Shelley, Wordsworth,
                Coleridge, Tennyson, Robert Browning and W. W. A handsome 279 pp. book in the
                beautiful easy handy French style.</p>       
            <p class="tei_p">Your postal card of two weeks since received—have
                not heard anything more of "Grashalme" or Rolleston—hear frequently from Dr. Bucke—my dear friend O'Connor at Washington very ill
                yet—Wm. Walsh on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>, and
                Julius Chambers on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span> are
                friendly to me—I am sitting in my big rattan chair by the oak fire writing
                this—sit here this way nearly all day—a young man, friend Horace
                    Traubel (of German stock) comes in every day, is very
                faithful and kind and serves as medium to the printers. Write—</p>
