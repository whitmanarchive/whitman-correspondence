                        either July 31 or August 7, 1872. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter
                        Wednesday, and the marking in the upper right margin of the first page may
                        be the time of the day, "abt 6." That mark, however, is unreliable because
                        it is illegible. Edwin Haviland Miller did not note this summer 1872 letter
                        (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1961–77], 2:367).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">When requesting a two-week extension of his summer leave, Walt Whitman
                        planned to return to the office of the attorney general on July 25, 1872
                        (see his <a href="nar.03601">July 9, 1872</a> letter to Webster
                        Elmes). According to Louisa's letter, a packet service came to gather Walt's
                        trunk just after he departed for Washington, D.C. However, Louisa at the
                        close of the letter seems to expect that Walt would visit soon. He planned
                        to visit on August 31, 1872 (see his <a href="duk.00659">August
                            22–23, 1872</a> letter to Louisa). If Walt returned to
                        Washington as planned on July 25, this letter probably dates to the
                        following Wednesday, July 31, 1872. But since Louisa expected Walt to visit
                        again shortly after her arrival in Camden, this letter may date a week
                        later, to August 7, 1872.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.04776_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.04776_n2"><span>Walt Whitman's July 30 or

                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt

                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed

                    place them in an orphan asylum, Nancy first indicated her willingness to release
                    Georgy into their care in late 1871 (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="yal.00310">October 23, 1871</a> letter to Walt). Georgy's older

                    Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman for a time, but this letter seems to indicate that
                    Georgy still remained with his mother. The cause of his death is not known, but
                    Georgy Whitman was killed in October 1872 (see Manahatta Whitman's <a href="loc.00628">October 26, 1872</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor

                    concentrated in New England states, and the Shakers practiced communal worship
                    and emphasized communal property ownership. The Shakers practiced formal
