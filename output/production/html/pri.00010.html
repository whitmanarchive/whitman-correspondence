                    (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
                    Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
                    of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
                    prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

                    Scott. Whitman noted receipt of the volumes on March 18 in his Commonplace Book
                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). A presentation copy in the Feinberg
                    Collection reads: "Walt Whitman with Ernest Rhys's apologies &amp; high regards.
                    1st March 1886." On <a href="loc.03313">May 22</a> Rhys informed the poet
                    that about 8,000 copies of the edition were sold, and that the publisher
                    expected to print a second edition. In the same letter Rhys requested permission
                    to include <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> in a prose series called The
