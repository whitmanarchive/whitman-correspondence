        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend—</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Yours of April 4 has come to hand—with picture, which I prize—you speak of Mr. Elster's
        criticism—when it comes I shall have it carefully translated to me—if you
        communicate with him, please give him my serious thanks &amp; good will—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">All your <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">papers</span>, copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">D. Fremblik</span> &amp;
        your <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">letters</span> have reached me safely in the past—(also the large
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">photo</span>. by poor Clausen.) Did you receive <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Redwood Tree</span> in Harper's Magazine—&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Prayer of Columbus</span>—sent some weeks (March 4)
        since? <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">This piece</span> of C. Petersen is in the May <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>, a New York Monthly. I will make inquiry about
        Petersen, &amp; if I see him or find out I will duly write you. I am not well yet—far
        from it—but live in hopes—</p>

        <p class="tei_p">John Burroughs visited me for two days lately—He is
          well, is married, (36 years old), has left Washington, &amp; has settled on a little farm
          with horse, cows, &amp; fowls on the banks of the Hudson river, 60 miles from New York,
          his native state &amp; mine. I am to go there the coming summer. J. B. is a most natural,
          homely, good man—(like an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">apple–tree</span>, or <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pine</span>, or a good <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">field</span> of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">wheat</span>—yet thoroughly human)—has a nice
          wife, kind &amp; good to me, like a sister. </p>

        <p class="tei_p">To–day is dark &amp; rainy here—spring very backward here—I sit here in the
          room alone, writing this—I am much alone—</p>
