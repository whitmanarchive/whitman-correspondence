                    wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
                    "I intend to write

                    Norwegian named Kristian Elster, who had expressed "a great fear that the editor
                    (in Christiania) would not print it. In the war, on the roaring sea the
                    Norwegians are a people of heroes; but in their civil and literary life they are
                    a race of cowards." According to Roos, Elster (1841–1881) was a friend of
