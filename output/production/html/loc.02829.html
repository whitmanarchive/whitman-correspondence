      <p class="tei_p">I take an interest in the boy in the office, Harry Stafford—I know his father &amp; mother—There is a large family, very respectable American people—farmers, but only a hired farm—Mr. Stafford in weak health—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am anxious Harry should <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">learn the printer's trade thoroughly—I want him to learn to set type 
        as fast as possible</span>—want you to give him a chance (less of the mere errands &amp;c)—There is a good deal really in the boy, if he has a chance.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Don't say any thing about this note to him—or in fact to any one—just tear it up, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">keep the matter to yourself private</span>.

                        the Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Republic</span>, where Harry Stafford was an
                        errand boy. (Since Whitman became acquainted with the Staffords in 1876, the
                        year appears to be correct.)</p>

                            1876</a>, she was worried because Harry "left the New Republic office
