                    (1857–1920) was one of Professor Edward Dowden's students, a poet,
                    biographer of Lessing, and historian of Irish myth and legends (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</span>, ed. Horst
                    Frenz [Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1951], 7). The
                    correspondence between the two men began in 1879 (see Rolleston's letters in the
                    John Rylands Library, Manchester, England), but the poet's replies (at least
                    six) are missing. On <a href="loc.03539">October 16, 1880</a>, Rolleston
                    sent Whitman a copy of his translation of Epictetus which he had printed at his
                    own expense. The pamphlet is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.
                    In the following year the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Enchiridion</span> of Epictetus was
                    published in London by Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Co. In his copy, also in the
                    Feinberg Collection, Whitman wrote in 1886 or 1888: "Have had this little Vol.
                    at hand or in my hand often all these years." The markings in three different
                    colors testify to the fact that Whitman perused the book. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00760_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00760_n3"><span>Whitman sent a letter to
