            <p class="tei_p">I am just writing this after reading your November Boughs. I want to tell you that I
                was glad of the Book. It comes to me in a time of trouble for me and it is a
                help—I think you will not be sorry to know this. If I were face to face with
                you there are many things in your last poems and writings I should like to talk over
                with you, but it is all too long for a letter and we cannot, save with difficulty, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">talk</span> on paper.
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Your sketch of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Elias Hicks</span> is very
                pleasant to see, as like yourself I am proud of having Friends among my forebears,
                and their early history is a noble one, surely. You record some folks opinion that Elias was ambitious, but I don't see it in his
               face nor in the tone of the words you quote, nor in your <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_quantity_4 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span>
                impressions and I <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_quantity_9 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span> against it. You did a service 
                <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">before</span> in showing people the truth about  
               Old Tom Paine, Blake's friend, and I think many will be thankful for your work on Elias Hicks.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I don't suppose Dante's Commedia was popular with those he judged, but the next
               generation did not sympathize much with them, and I am sure that the next generation in

                your last book has been a help for which I am grateful to you as I am for the

                 I only feel that I do not do you justice as with the performance
