            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday I received all your dispatches—viz, a postcard—a letter—a
                circular (with scraps)—a copy of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G</span>​ —and a set of
                proofsheets of ditto. Shall find them very useful. For all of which things, many
                thanks—I am delighted to see your new <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">edn</span>​  in such grand form, and spent all yesterday reading it.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Sometimes I missed
                regretfully a familiar rhythm and was sorry to see 'Respondez' cut up and scattered
                about the book—most of it summarily suppressed. It was, of course, rather a
                gritty poem to read straight through. Still I am very glad that I have it complete
                in my old <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">edn</span>​ .<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Nearly always I have come to think your many alterations, improvements.
                This volume, with its new poems, etc. offered a field of "pleasant exploration" and
                renewed my sense of wonder and delight at your works. It is a splendid thing to have
                given them final form in this way—resumed them all in this noble volume. I
                like many of your new poems immensely, especially perhaps 'Spirit that form'd this
                scene'—a Riddle Song, and the Dalliance of the Eagles. The Riddle Song puzzled
                me—I could only think of (for the 'two words')<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> the end of a sonnet of W. B.
                Scott</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_linegroup"><span class="tei_l">For we know nought of that dark sun, the True,</span>
            <span class="tei_l">Whose latent heats create our spiritual year.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a></span></span></span>

            Yet I don't feel as if this could be it.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very glad you like the idea of a German translation. I have had a reported
                admirer of yours, as collaborateur in my eye for some time, but I find now he is
                only a rather pedantic old savan, and that his knowledge of and admiration for you
                are both of a very limited character. However I will go on by myself at present and
                have a good mass of work ready for revision when I find the right man. The work
                shall certainly be done, and done as well as my pains and the best German help can
                do it. From attempts I have made I am convinced that a very impressive, quite
                satisfactory translation of your <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G.</span>​  might be made in German. It is
                a language, which, as Germans well know, offers extraordinary facilities for
                translation especially poetic, from foreign tongues, e.g. a Greek play, which is a
                bald affair in the best English, can be put into German with all the choral metres,
                etc. accurately preserved, and lose little of its freshness and energy. Of course
                the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">transl.</span>​  would be complete—a reproduction of your new <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">vol.</span>​  just as it is.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Russian</span> translation is also probable (and certainly
                at least as desirable as the German). A friend and countryman of mine named Lee,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>
                living here, is an ardent Russian scholar and intimate with many men of that nation,
                living here and in Servia, etc. They are mostly exiles, which means, speaking
                generally, men of unusual ability and thoughtfulness. I have made Lee acquainted
                with the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G.</span>​  which he appreciates, and he has just written for your
                new <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">edn</span>​ . And I think (though I have not broached the subject yet) that he would be
                likely to undertake a Russian translation, and that he could get the best possible
                help for it. I shall get him to lend his book to some of his Russian friends, and
                work on this as much as I can. The book would doubtless be prohibited by Government
                but that would not hinder its spread much, rather the contrary.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I shall have one or
                two things to ask you about with reference to the German <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">transl</span>​ . Can now only think of the word 'equals' in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">To him that
                    was Crucified</span>. I take this (contrary to the general opinion as far as I
                know) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> to imply that the little band of teachers are equal
                among themselves (there seems little significance in saying this) but rather that
                they are the equals of all other men—able to put themselves on common footing with
                all they meet, and establish free, healthy relations with them—as the
                Answerer—"the mechanics take him for a mechanic"—etc. etc. In this sense
                I should be inclined to translate the word.—Indeed though, as far as the
                translation goes, the word could be literally rendered in German and have both
                meanings open, as in English, and this of course would be the right thing to do.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Are you sure about the double text of English and German? It seems to me as if it
                would give the book a formidably scientific appearance. Did anyone ever get much
                comfort out of one of those polyglot bibles with the Greek, Hebrew, Latin, English, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Objibbeway​ </span></span> etc., all arranged in parallel columns? And would people buy largely a
                book of poems of which half was in an unknown tongue? I see the advantages of the
                plan—but, at present at least, it appears to me that the disadvantages
                preponderate, especially as your works could be rendered, I think, with full
                accuracy in German—really reproducing both form and matter.—I believe
                the work would strike root <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">deeply</span> in Germany and might be of
                vast importance.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did you see that the Fortschritt<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> ( = more or less Girondist) party have had great
                successes at the last elections here?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have ordered my book to be sent to the American papers you mentioned. I shall be
                here for a year certainly. Will always let you know my movements and about the
                translation, etc.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours sincerely</span>

            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">You should have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">recd.</span>​  a copy of my Encheiridion by this.</p>
