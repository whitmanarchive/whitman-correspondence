                    <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">I copy the foregoing from page 709, in the May number of the Contemporary Review in an article: 
                    "The Interpretation of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Litterature​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Literature​

                    Professor Dowden, thinking you may not have seen it, and it may give you 
                    pleasure to see it. At Venice, a year ago, I met Mr. Symmonds, an English 
                    author of eminence, who greatly admired your writings and was eager to hear of you. Whenever I 
                    hear your works mentioned it is with a frank and outspoken admiration formerly more rare. And 
                    though you

                    must hear this now from all sides, still there may be moments when a friendly reiteration of it 
                    coming unexpectedly may not be uncheering to you. I think your works are doing good in the world. 
                    The revelation which is in the life all around us and in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ourselfs​ </span><span class="tei_corr">ourselves​

                    is more listened to, more respected. What is true, then, is more respected; what is natural is 
                    more respected; less violence is done to nature, or at any rate urged and insisted on as what ought 
                    to be done. Happiness is increased, increasing, &amp; is to be probably immeasurably more increased. 
                    To have had a share, and so large a share, in this work must be a great happiness &amp; cause of 
                    thankfulness for you. Excuse so long a letter. I meant it to be shorter. It calls for no answer. I 
                    hope all goes well with you. That you

                <p class="tei_p">"We can point to no writer who drew early to his side a small band of eminent disciples and at the 
                    same time suffered shame and scoffing or total neglect from the crowd, who did not in the end prove 
                    a power in literature and gradually win acceptance from the world. Such was Wordsworth's 
                    position in the opening years of this century; such a little later was Shelley's 
                    position. Such was Carlyle's half a century since, and Mr. Browning's 
                    at a date more recent. Such also was Mr. Whitman's position until of late, when a considerable 
                     company has gathered to his side and the 
                    voice of opposition has almost fallen silent."</p>
