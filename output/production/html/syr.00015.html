                    author of eminence, who greatly admired your writings and was eager to hear of you. Whenever I

                    coming unexpectedly may not be uncheering to you. I think your works are doing good in the world. 
                    The revelation which is in the life all around us and in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ourselfs​ </span></span> 
                    is more listened to, more respected. What is true, then, is more respected; what is natural is 
                    more respected; less violence is done to nature, or at any rate urged and insisted on as what ought 
                    to be done. Happiness is increased, increasing, &amp; is to be probably immeasurably more increased. 
                    To have had a share, and so large a share, in this work must be a great happiness &amp; cause of 
                    thankfulness for you. Excuse so long a letter. I meant it to be shorter. It calls for no answer. I 
                    hope all goes well with you. That you

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
