            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours duly received<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>  I have had so many things to attend to lately that I have not been able to get time to answer and can only do so now so that you may know that I hav'nt forgotten you</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are still at work getting out specifications for the settling Reservoirs<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—a job of about $700 000—and of course we feel mighty anxious to cover all points so that we wont be upset by any sharp practice</p>
            <p class="tei_p">On the street to-day I saw a very interesting yet somewhat painful sight—twas that of a family moving in from the plains—An old woman—I shoud judge all of eighty—another woman of about 35—a young man and his wife abt 25 a boy of 12 two children 8 and 6 and a little babe—all but the young man and his wife were in the wagon drawn by 4 oxen—the wagon covered with dirty white canvass—The boy had leading with a rope a fine old cow—a young cow and calf were alongside—under the wagon was a large white dog and inside by the old woman was a small black terrier—They had met with an accident in the way of b[r]eaking one of the hind wheels and were therefore hard up—The faces of all were a study—but particularly of the young man and his wife—neither of them was at all handsome but yet I shall remember their faces for a long time—The old woman had that peculiar look of crazy stupidity that you can hardly tell whether they are really stupid or thinking of by-gone life  The talk of the crowd was that they had been driven in by the Indians—but I doubt that part of the story—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is a report in town to-day that some of the "bloody injuns" were stealing cows &amp;c just outside town—about where we propose to set our pumping engines—Of course I suppose its all humbug—but yet cannot see what such a detailed statement as is in the paper this morning is printed for—<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter from Mother a few days ago—she appears to be getting along middling well yet I wish she could get a better place to live—<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">From a letter received from Mat to-day she is having a first rate time yet—I wish you would write her—address care of G. F. Mason,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> Towanda, Give my regards to Mr &amp; Mrs O'Conner<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> and friends that I met in Washington—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you may be able to carry out your idea and come out to see us—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">good by for the present  write me as often as you can</p>

                    Pacific Street and in July moved to a new house at 1194 Atlantic Avenue. She
                    complained of the small rooms and the "bad smells" from the sewer (see the
