                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    had written (truthfully) in his Commonplace Book: "Quite a number of offers f'm
                    publishers, magazine editors, &amp; heads of newspaper syndicates these times."
                    Although he feigned equanimity about his critical reception, he did not accept
                    rejections gracefully, even though he was now writing, as he admitted, "pot
                    boilers" (see Whitman's <a href="loc.07753">February 2, 1890</a>, letter
                    to the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke). No doubt Walt Whitman expected
                    that friends like William Sloane Kennedy would attack the "enemy." But Kennedy
                    in his reply on <a href="loc.08186">June 19, 1890</a>, said: "Well what of
                    it? You can afford to rest on yr glorious laurels. If only a stirring great

                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
