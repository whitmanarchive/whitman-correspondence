                Fairly with me these days—Did I tell you my last piece (poem) was rejected by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> 
                (R W Gilder)—I 
                have now been shut off by all the magazines here &amp; the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth Century</span> in England—&amp; 
                feel like closing house as poem writer—(you know a fellow doesn't make brooms or shoes if nobody will have 'em)—I shall put 
                in order a last little 6 or 8 page annex (the second) of my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—&amp; that will probably be the 
                finish—

                I get out almost daily in wheel chair—was out yesterday down to river shore &amp; staid there an hour—cloudy weather 
                now fourth day, but entirely pleasant—appetite fair—had oatmeal porridge, honey &amp; tea for breakfast—shall probably 
                have stew'd mutton &amp; rice for early supper (do not eat dinner at all, find it best)—have massage every day—bath 
                also—have a good nurse Warren Fritzinger—sell a book occasionally—get along better 
                than you might think anyhow—have some pretty bad spells—some talkers bores questioners (hateful)—two splendid 
                letters lately f'm R G Ingersoll—I enclose Dr B[ucke]'s, rec'd this morning—Love 
                to Mrs: K— God bless you both—
