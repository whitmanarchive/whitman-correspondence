      <p class="tei_p">Your good letter rec'd this morning. Come &amp; see me whenever you can. It is very easy—6 or 8 
        trains fro &amp; to N. Y. every day &amp; night. Come either by boat to Amboy, &amp; so directly here to 
        Camden depot, (only 60 rods from this house,) or from Jersey City to West Philadelphia depot, 
        &amp; so down Market st. by horse cars to Camden ferry at foot of it. I am about the same. 
        Jeff is here with me (from St. Louis) for a couple of days.
      </p>
