            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Well here we are at Newport News, and glad enough to get out of the mud, in which the grand Army of the Potomac has lived moved, and had its being, ever since we first joined it.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> We arived here yesterday, and are encamped in a good dry place, and I hear we are to have new Tents in a day or two, so I think we will soon be nicely fixed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt if you have received the money from home, I wish you would send it on to me as soon as you can, as I think likely, that I will have a chance to go home (for 10 days) sometime next week. There is no Express Office here but it will come as far as Fortress Monroe which is 6 or 7 miles from here, and I will manage to go down there and get it. Probaly the best way would be for you to Enquire at the Express Office about what time, the money would reach Fortress Monroe, and write me, so that I will know when to go for it. I dont know, certain, that I can get, leave of absence, next week but I thnk my chances are pretty good,  there is nothing sure about these things, you know, untill a fellow gets the documents in his fist. Of course we know nothing at all, about what they brought us here for, but I rather think I was right in the surmise (in my last letter to you) about Burnsides<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> organizeing a force for a seperate command. Anyhow I am glad to get out of the Potomac Army for it seems as if it would never be able to accomplish any thing,  And yet I believe it was as fine an Army (as far as their fighting qualities is concerned) as was ever seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well Walt I believe that I have nothing more to say, and as I am quite buisy to day getting things in shape I will stop writing and go to work. Good bye</p>

                    referring specifically to the "mud march" which began on January 21, 1863. After
                    General Ambrose Everett Burnside's unsuccessful attempt to capture
                    Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862, he finally persuaded Lincoln to approve the
                    Army's crossing the Rappahannock River in a second attempt to take possession of
                    the city. It resulted, however, in nothing except a wretched expedition in which
                    the troops floundered in "floods of rain and seas of sticky clay without making
                    any progress in its purpose of attacking Lee" (J. G. Randall, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Civil War and Reconstruction</span> [1937], 315). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00339_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Loving tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00339_n2"><span>At the outbreak of the

                    Infantry. On January 25, 1863, Lincoln removed Burnside and put General Joseph
                    Hooker (1814–1879) in command of the Army of the Potomac. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
