            <span class="tei_salute">Dear, dear friend,</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I shall try and come to New Haven, very soon—though but for perhaps two or three
            hours. For some days past my mother has been ill—some of the time very
            ill—and I have been nurse &amp; doctor too, as none of my sisters are home at
            present—But to-day she seems over it, if the favorable symptoms continue.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a></p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have procured the portrait &amp; frame without any trouble,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> &amp; they are now hanging up in mother's front room—&amp; are the delight
            &amp; ever-increasing gratification of my folks &amp; friends, young &amp;
            old—some of whom sit by the half hour &amp; just look steadily at it in
            silence—It is indeed a noble piece of work-manship—age has already improved it, &amp; will still more—both painting
            &amp; frame were unharmed—Mr. Blondell, 806 Broadway, had the painting, &amp; has
            others of yours.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>
         </p>
         <p class="tei_p">Dear Charley, I cannot fix the day, but I will indeed try to come forthwith. I too wish
            to be with you once more—though it will be but so briefly<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Much love to you, my dear friend,—not forgetting your wife &amp; children.</p>

                    (1827–1871) was the painter who created the oil painting from which the

                    have received word from Hine that he was very ill. On <a href="nyp.00282">July 26</a>, Whitman wrote to William D. O'Connor that an "artist friend

                    Dodworth Hall at 806 Broadway in New York City was one of several buildings in
                    which artists rented studio space from the 1850s to 1870s. Whitman's old friend
                    Jesse Talbot rented space there at the same time as Hine. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_prc.00092_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_genoways tei_note_type_editorial note" id="prc.00092_n5"><span>On July 26, Whitman
                    started out for New Haven and stayed that night and all the next day with Hine.
                    On <a href="loc.01540">July 28</a>, he wrote Peter Doyle, "I thought he
                    would die while I was there—he was all wasted to a skeleton, faculties
                    good, but voice only a low whisper—I returned last night, after
                    midnight—" Within ten days, Hine died. On <a href="loc.01730">August
                        4</a>, his wife wrote to Whitman: "It is useless for me to tell you how
                    strong his affection was for you, and how he has looked forward to you coming to
                    N.H. I think that after your visit to him that his hold on life seemed to give
                    way and his yearnings were all accomplished" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [1906–1996], 9 vols., 3:330). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
