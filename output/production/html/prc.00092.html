            <span class="tei_salute">Charles Hine,</span>
            <span class="tei_salute">Dear, dear friend,</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I shall try and come to New Haven, very soon—though but for perhaps two or three
            hours. For some days past my mother has been ill—some of the time very
            ill—and I have been nurse &amp; doctor too, as none of my sisters are home at
            present—But to-day she seems over it, if the favorable symptoms continue.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have procured the portrait &amp; frame without any trouble, &amp; they are now hanging up in mother's front room—&amp; are the delight
            &amp; ever-increasing gratification of my folks &amp; friends, young &amp;
            old—some of whom sit by the half hour &amp; just look steadily at it in
            silence—It is indeed a noble piece of work-manship—age has already improved it, &amp; will still more—both painting
            &amp; frame were unharmed—Mr. Blondell, 806 Broadway, had the painting, &amp; has
            others of yours.
         </p>
         <p class="tei_p">Dear Charley, I cannot fix the day, but I will indeed try to come forthwith. I too wish
            to be with you once more—though it will be but so briefly—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Much love to you, my dear friend,—not forgetting your wife &amp; children.</p>
