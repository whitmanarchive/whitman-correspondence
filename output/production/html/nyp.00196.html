               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your welcome letter of December 30 came safe. I have written &amp; sent my application to Mr Otto,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; also a few lines to Mr Ashton, with a copy of it.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I am most desirous to get the appointment, as enclosing, with the rest of the points, my attentions to the soldiers &amp; to my poems, as you intimate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It may be Drum-Taps may come out this winter, yet, (in the way I have mentioned in times past.) It is in a state to put right through, a perfect copy being ready for the printers—I feel at last, &amp; for the first time without any demur, that I am satisfied with it—content to have it go to the world verbatim &amp; punctuation. It is in my opinion superior to Leaves of Grass—certainly more perfect as a work of art, being adjusted in all its proportions, &amp; its passion having the indispensable merit that though to the ordinary reader let loose with wildest abandon, the true artist can see it is yet under control. But I am perhaps mainly satisfied with Drum-Taps because it delivers my ambition of the task that has haunted me, namely, to express in a poem (&amp; in the way I like, which is not at all by directly stating it) the pending action of this <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Time</span> &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Land we swim in</span>, with all their large conflicting fluctuations of despair &amp; hope, the shiftings, masses, &amp; the whirl &amp; deafening din, (yet over all, as by invisible hand, a definite purport &amp; idea)—with the unprecedented anguish of wounded &amp; suffering, the beautiful young men, in wholesale death &amp; agony, everything sometimes as if in blood color, &amp; dripping blood. The book is therefore unprecedently sad, (as these days are, are they not?)—but it also has the blast of the trumpet, &amp; the drum pounds &amp; whirrs in it, &amp; then an undertone of sweetest comradeship &amp; human love, threading its steady thread inside the chaos, &amp; heard at every lull &amp; interstice thereof—truly also it has clear notes of faith &amp; triumph.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Drum Taps has none of the perturbations of Leaves of Grass. I am satisfied with Leaves of Grass (by far the most of it) as expressing what was intended, namely, to express by sharp-cut self assertion, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">One's-Self</span> &amp; also, or may be still more, to map out, to throw together for American use, a gigantic embryo or skeleton of Personality, fit for the West, for native models—but there are a few things I shall carefully eliminate in the next issue, &amp; a few more I shall considerably change.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see I have said I consider Drum-Taps superior to Leaves of Grass. I probably mean as a piece of wit, &amp; from the more simple &amp; winning nature of the subject, &amp; also because I have in it only succeeded to my satisfaction in removing all superfluity from it, verbal superfluity I mean. I delight to make a poem where I feel clear that not a word but is indispensable part thereof &amp; of my meaning.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Still Leaves of Grass is dear to me, always dearest to me, as my first born, as daughter of my life's first hopes, doubts, &amp; the putting in form of those days' efforts &amp; aspirations—true, I see now, with some things in it I should not put in if I were to write now, but yet I shall certainly let them stand, even if but for proofs of phases passed away—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother &amp; all home are well as usual. Not a word for over three months from my brother George<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—the probabilities are most gloomy. I see the Howells<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> now &amp; then. I am well, but need to leave here—need a change. If you see Miss Howard tell her Jesse Mullery<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> has been to see me—came yesterday &amp; has just left this forenoon. He talked of nothing but her. His life is saved, &amp; he will have tolerably good strength &amp; health, at least for present. His address is Ward <a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>, Centre st Hospital, Newark New Jersey. I was up at Mrs Price's the other night. She is better this winter. Mrs Paulina Wright Davis7 is stopping with her this winter. I have sent a paper with sketch of Hospital Visits, to Dr Wm F Channing.<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> I cannot forgive myself for not acknowledging his assistance for the Hospitals, by letter at the time. I send you another paper also, as you might like it. I take it by a line in your letter that Charles Eldridge has not gone to Boston.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> I have been reading the strange articles from the Richmond press.<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> A thousand Satans baffled, with terror, hatred, malignant squirming, appear in every paragraph. Little California is playing around me as I finish, &amp; has been for half an hour. Love to dear Nelly &amp; Jeannie &amp; all.</p>

                    Wilson Allen observes: "What makes it important is Whitman's great exertion to

                    family did not hear from George for some time, it did everything possible to
                    send provisions to him and to arrange for a prisoner exchange. On <a href="nyp.00231">January 4, 1865</a>, David F. Wright wrote to Whitman
                    to explain that a gentleman who had a relative in an Ohio prison camp was
                    anxious to arrange for an exchange: "Your brother's name was given &amp; the

                    "Hospital Book 12" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Sergeant Jesse Mullery,
                    Company K, Fifteenth New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital, on May
                    14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball in
                    lung—(ball still in probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June
                    23, 1864, he went home to Vernon, New Jersey, on furlough, and then served as
                    assistant cook in the army hospital in Newark. On <a href="nyp.00218">December 26, 1864</a>, Mullery proposed a visit to Brooklyn. He was still
                    at the Newark hospital on January 23, 1865. By 1866, Mullery was employed in a
                    store in New York. According to his letters of <a href="nyp.00178">May
                        3</a> and <a href="nyp.00179">June 11, 1865</a>, he later was able
                    to return to active duty. (In the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New
                    York Public Library, there are four letters from Mullery and one from his father
                    to Whitman.) In several letters Mullery referred to the kindnesses of a Miss
                    Howard while he was in the hospital, and another soldier, Charles H. Harris, on
                        <a href="nyp.00163">May 30, 1864</a>, asked to be remembered to Miss
                    Howard and her sister. On February 20, 1866, Mullery wrote that one of the
                    Howard sisters had died the preceding fall, and recalled "the Same Sad Smile on
                    her countenance" (The Library of Congress). Probably these were the Misses
                    Sallie and Carrie Howard listed in the 1866 Directory, or the Miss Garaphelia
                    Howard mentioned in "Letter from Walt Whitman to Ellen M. O'Connor, 3 February
