                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,

                    points over the "semi-sexual" implications of comradeship in his letter of
                        <a href="loc.04201">August 3</a>, Whitman wrote in a draft letter of
                        <a href="loc.02142">August 19</a>: "Ab't the questions on Calamus
                    pieces &amp;c: they quite daze me. L of G. is only to be rightly construed by
                    and within its own atmosphere and essential character—all of its pages
                    &amp; pieces so coming strictly under <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span>—that
                    the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as
                    mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be
                    even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at the time entirely undream'd
                    &amp; unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd by me
                    &amp; seem damnable." <p class="tei_p">Symonds' reply on September 5 concealed his
                        disappointment. As a disciple he thanked the poet for stating "so clearly
                        &amp; precisely what you feel about the question I raised." But his opinion
                        remained unchanged: "It seems to me, I confess, still doubtful whether
                        (human nature being what it is) we can expect wholly to eliminate some
                        sensual alloy from any emotions which are raised to a very high pitch of
                        passionate intensity." The same reservation appears in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Studies in Sexual Inversion</span> (1897): "No one who knows anything
                        about Walt Whitman will for a moment doubt his candour and sincerity.
                        Therefore the man who wrote 'Calamus,' and preached the gospel of
                        comradeship, entertains feelings at least as hostile to sexual inversion as
                        any law-abiding humdrum Anglo-Saxon could desire. It is obvious that he has
                        not even taken the phenomena of abnormal instinct into account. Else he must
                        have foreseen that, human nature being what it is, we cannot expect to
                        eliminate all sexual alloy from emotions raised to a high pitch of
                        passionate intensity, and that permanent elements within the midst of our
                        society will emperil the absolute purity of the ideal he attempts to

                    Paul's categories of those who will "not inherit the kingdom of God,"
                    particularly men who had sex with men. See, for example, 1 Corinthians
                    6:9–10, which in the King James version reads: "Know ye not that the
                    unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither
                    fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of
                    themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers,
                    nor ers, shall inherit the kingdom of God." In the New King James Version
                    (1982), "homosexuals" and "sodomites" replace "effeminate" and "abusers of
                    themselves with mankind." </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
