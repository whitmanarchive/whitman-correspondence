                    (1841–1899) was a noted journalist in Philadelphia, New York, and
                    Washington, D.C. A Pennsylvania native, he began writing at the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> at age seventeen and was named a managing editor in
                    1862. After serving as a war journalist during the Civil War, he moved to New
                    York in 1865 to work at the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, which he
                    edited from 1866 to 1868. In 1870 he established his own newspaper, the New York
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Standard</span>. In 1877, he was invited to accompany
                    President Ulysses S. Grant on a world tour; Young published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Around the World with General Grant</span>, a two-volume account of the tour,
                    in 1879. Young's knowledge of the Chinese language earned him the position of
                    the American ambassador to China from 1882 to 1885. He became the seventh
                    Librarian of Congress in 1897 and served until his death. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Men and Memories</span> (New York, F. Tennyson Neely, 1901), a posthumous
                    collection of Young's personal reminiscences, his editor and wife, May Dow
                    Russell Young writes: "A deep and genuine affection existed between Walt Whitman
                    and John Russell Young, the result of many years' acquaintance and profound
                    admiration" (76). The collection includes Young's account of reading the first
                    edition of  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and later meeting Whitman in
                    Washington, D.C. (76–109). For more information, see John C. Broderick,

                    travelled with former president Ulysses S. Grant on a world tour and documented
                    their travels in the two-volume work, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Around the World with
                        General Grant</span> (New York: The American News Company, 1879). On <a href="loc.04890">November 3, 1891</a>, Young sent the volumes to Whitman
                    "as a souvenir of our pleasant meeting with [Sir Edwin] Arnold," an English poet
                    and admirer of Whitman. The meeting had taken place on November 2, at Whitman's
                    home in Camden.
