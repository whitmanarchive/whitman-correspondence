                <span class="tei_salute">Mr. Walt Whitman,</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is very mortifying to me not to be in a position to send you even a small portion
                of the balance <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">your​ </span></span> due. We are in a 
                much better locality for retail trade, and we hope to stir up a better mail trade by 
                a new list which we shall send out soon. But we cannot hope for anything very satisfactory, 
                considering the unprecedented stagnation in all business circles, for several weeks. 
                Assuming A.K.B. &amp; Co.'s liabilities at such a time as this has made it very awkward 
                for me. I never was in debt before. The business would be unmixed pleasure to me were 
                my capital larger, as I think I can serve humanity better by distributing good books 
                than in any other way. The first opportunity <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00266_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00266_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00266_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00266_large.jpg</span>
                that can be made, something will be sent you. I regret the inability to
                promptly settle more as I have understood you have never been paid by others who
                kept your books on sale. There seems no reason to doubt a good business being done
                here in a few weeks—in the early fall. I hope your health is improving. Many
                persons ask us about you, and take a keen interest in your welfare. I regret that I
                am not so situated as to be able to extend you an invitation to visit New York, and 
                offer you comfortable quarters here while you remain; but I do not "keep house"; have 
                no family; and I vibrate between New York and Brooklyn as to sleeping quarters, not 
                having any fixed habitation. Some one is compiling a book for the use of "Liberals" 
                at funerals, etc. I have called his attention to your poem on Death ("Dark mother," 
                etc.),<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> which I consider the finest ever written.</p>

                    Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875, Somerby assumed the liabilities of
                    Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's <a href="loc.01718">February 4, 1874</a>,
                    letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
                    embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
                    unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On <a href="loc.01934">May
                        5, 1875</a>, he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
                    position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On <a href="loc.01936">October 4, 1875</a>, Somerby sent $10—his
                    only cash payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require,
                    and find it utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would
                    accept our offer to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our
                    indebtedness to you." On <a href="loc.01937">April 19, 1876</a>, Somerby
                    reported that "I have been losing, instead of gaining." On <a href="loc.01939">May 6, 1876</a>, he sent Whitman a statement
                    pertaining to some volumes; on <a href="loc.01938">May 12, 1876</a>, he
                    included a complete financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one
                    cash payment, and owed Walt Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to
                    make a payment on <a href="loc.01940">September 28, 1876</a>. In August
                    1877, Whitman received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
                     from, in his
                    own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
                    Somerby." These manuscripts are in The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
