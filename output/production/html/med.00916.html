            <p class="tei_p">Still badly prostrated—horrible torpidity. Y'rs &amp; Dr [Johnston]'s letters rec'd &amp; cheer me 
                much. Am sitting here in big chair at this moment.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I guess I have a good deal of the feeling of Epictetus &amp; stoicism, or tried to have. They are specially needed in a rich &amp; luxurious 
                &amp; even scientific age—But I am clear that I include &amp; allow &amp; probably teach some things stoicism would frown upon 
                &amp; discard—One's pulses &amp; marrow are not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">democratic &amp; natural</span> for nothing—Let Plato's steeds prance &amp; curvet &amp; drive at their utmost, 
                but the master's grip &amp; eyes &amp; brain must retain the ultimate power for all, or things are lost.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my loving compliments to all the boys, &amp; give this scrawl to 
                Wentworth Dixon to keep if he cares for it.
