            <p class="tei_p">After a storm of three days, and more snow than has
                fallen at once here for several winters, it has cleared off—whether warm or cold,
                one cannot yet say, for the weather is as coquettish as a lively girl.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Political
                "Festivals" are considerably numerous about now. They are given <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">by</span> the Whigs in
                honor of Taylor's success—just as if that had not come to be an old story. I look
                upon them as flummery, whose only benefit is felt in the pockets of the
                landlord—that is, if he gets his pay.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The California fever has somewhat decreased;
                you may see quite a good many advertisements in the papers, offering tickets for
                passages, procured and paid for in the first heat, which has passed over.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A benefit
                comes off this evening at the Tabernacle, for the Musicians of the Park Theatre
                orchestra. The programme is a most attractive one, and no doubt the house will be
                crowded.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Balls and soirées are under way, at a great rate. The most notable of the
                forthcoming ones are the Firemen's ball at the Opera-house, on the evening of
                January 29th—the soirée of the Northern Lighters, at the Chinese Assembly Rooms, on
                the night of January 4th, and the Erina ball, on the 3d of January.</p>
