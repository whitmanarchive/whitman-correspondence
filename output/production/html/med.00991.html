            <p class="tei_p">After a storm of three days, and more snow than has
                fallen at once here for several winters, it has cleared off—whether warm or cold,
                one cannot yet say, for the weather is as coquettish as a lively girl.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Political

                upon them as flummery, whose only benefit is felt in the pockets of the

                you may see quite a good many advertisements in the papers, offering tickets for

                the night of January 4th, and the Erina ball,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">4</a> on the 3d of January.</p>

                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n10 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n10"><span>Zachary Taylor (1784–1850), a Southern 
                    slaveholder and a well-known American miltary leader in the Mexican-American War, 
                was the Whig Candidate for president in the 1848 United
                States Presidential Election. Taylor won the election and went on to serve as the twelfth president of the
                United States, from 1849 until his death in 1850. </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00984_n10 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00984_n10"><span>In 1848, James W. Marshall was employed by 
                John A. Sutter to build a sawmill in what is today Coloma, California. Marshall found several pieces
                of gold, and the news of Marshall's discovery was the beginning of the California
                Gold Rush (1848–1855). The Gold Rush brought hundreds of thousands of people to 
                California in search of gold. As a result of the rapid growth, California was able to enter the Union as a free state
                as part of the Compromise of 1850, while Native Californians and indigenous
                societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by those seeking their fortunes in gold. </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00971_n10 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00971_n10"><span>Erina balls were
