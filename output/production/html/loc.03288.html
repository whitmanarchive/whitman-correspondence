                    met Whitman in Boston in 1860, and he remained an enthusiastic admirer; see

                        <a href="loc.01012">June 25, 1860</a>: "I love you, Walt! A conquering
                    Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became

                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The North American Review</span>, asked Whitman to send to
                    C. Allen Thorndike Rice, the proprietor of the magazine, his reminiscences of
                    Abraham Lincoln and also requested an article on "hospital life" during the
                    Civil War for Rice's newspaper syndicate, which printed popular articles in the
                    Sunday editions of such papers as the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>
                    and the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span>. Rice wrote on <a href="syr.00016">July 14</a> to Whitman soliciting contributions for the
                    syndicate. Apparently Whitman accepted both proposals in his (lost) letter which
                    Redpath received before he wrote on <a href="loc.03286">July 16</a>. On
                        <a href="loc.03287">August 11</a> Redpath informed Whitman that he was
                    enclosing "a check for sixty dollars, which is payment for the article according
                    to your own estimate of three thousand words, at the rate of twenty dollars a
                    thousand, which is the very highest rate they [the syndicate] pay." "Booth and
                    'The Bowery'" appeared in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> on August
                    16. Redpath paid $50 for "Slang in America" on October 20, which appeared in
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The North American Review</span> in November, 1885. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
