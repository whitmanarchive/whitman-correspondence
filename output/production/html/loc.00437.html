            <p class="tei_p">We received your letter<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> and [were] glad to get it too—We had all begun to feel a little worried about George—glad to hear that you are getting along so nicely—The Expressman did not come for your trunk yesterday as he promised so I called last night and [a]gain left the order—to-day at noon they came and got it giving a receipt for it  Enclosed I send the Key. I like to get letters from you  Matters are going about as usual with us. Mother is pretty well Mattie and the Children very well—I hope you will enjoy your cake that they put in the trunk—It looked nice when I put it in  I packed it Tuesday night and had it already Wednesday, but they did not come for it  I hope to be able to make you a visit this summer yet—How would it do to come when the review of the Army happens<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—could i see it or would it be like our New York shows—how long do you suppose George will remain around Washington?<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I should like to come before he goes away—Write</p>
