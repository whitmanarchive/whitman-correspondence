                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Einstein,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">On coming back here, I find your letter of the 20th. It is so kind (bringing up old memories, &amp; making prologue 
                &amp; ceremony unnecessary) that I will at once answer it in its own spirit, &amp; reveal the situation.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My paralysis has left me permanently disabled, unable to do any thing of any consequence, and yet with perhaps 
                (though old, not yet 60) some lease of life yet. I had saved up a little money, &amp; when I came here, nearly three 
                years ago, I bought a nice cheap lot, intending to put on a small house to haul in, &amp; live out the rest of my days.
            </p>
             
<p class="tei_p">I had, &amp; yet have I have a sort of idea that my books, (I am getting ready, or about have ready, my completed writings, 
                in two Volumes—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Two Rivulets</span>) 
                will henceforth furnish me reliably with sufficient for grub, 
                pocket money, &amp;c., if I have my own shanty to live in.</p>            
            
            <p class="tei_p">        
                But my means, meagre at the best, have gone for my expenses since, 
                &amp; now, while not hitherto actually wanting, (&amp; not worrying much about the future either,) I have come to the end of my rope, 
                &amp; am in fact ridiculously poor.</p>
            
           
            <p class="tei_p">
                I have my lot yet clear, &amp; it would be a great thing for me to be able to
                
                build forthwith a four or five 
                room shanty on it &amp; haul in, snug &amp; quiet, with the sense of security—for the rest of my days—for I feel yet about as cheerful 
                &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vimmy</span> as ever, &amp; may live several years yet,—indeed probably will—&amp; 
                may write some—though my days of active participation, &amp; ganging about in the world, are over.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I get out a little nearly every day, &amp; enjoy it, but am very lame—Keep stout &amp; red as ever—grayer than ever—am feeling pretty comfortable as I write—have just returned from a three weeks jaunt to Washington and Baltimore—which has much refreshed me, (the first time I have been away from my anchorage here for nearly three years.) 
                I often recall the old times in New York, or on Broadway, or at Pfaff's—&amp; the faces &amp; voices of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the boys</span>.—</p>
