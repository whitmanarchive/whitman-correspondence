                    Whitman still had not seen proofs, much less signed the photographs. He wrote
                    John H. Johnston on <a href="sal.00004">September 1, 1887</a>, "He
                    advertises . . . to sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is forged, &amp;
                    the former illegal &amp; unauthorized." The disagreement was quickly resolved,
                    and Whitman signed photographs for Cox and returned them. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
