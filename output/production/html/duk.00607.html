                    13, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter June 13, 1871, and this date is
                    almost certain. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University
                    Press, 1961–77], 2:368). At the close of the letter, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman asks Walt to "write in your this weeks letter what day you will come."
                    Walt arrived in Brooklyn for his vacation on Wednesday the following week (see
                    his <a href="loc.01589">June 21–23, 1871</a> letter to Peter Doyle).
                    If Louisa wrote on Tuesday afternoon and Walt received this letter before he
                    left Washington, it had to be sent on Tuesday, June 13 (rather than June 20). As
                    Walt generally notified Louisa of his planned visits well beforehand—and
                    he notified Abby Price of his intent to take an early summer vacation this year
                    in his <a href="pml.00030">April 21, 1871</a> letter—the June 13,
                    1871 date is the only one that accords with Louisa's being aware of when Walt
                    would take his summer 1871 vacation. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871.

                    George Washington Whitman was work completed for Joseph Phineas Davis
                    (1837–1917), chief engineer of the Water Works in Lowell, Massachusetts,
                    between 1870 and 1871. Davis, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
                    and the Whitman family, employed George to inspect pipe. For Davis's work with
                    Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see the following letters from Jeff to Walt Whitman:
                        <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January

                    also friendly with Davis, who stopped by her house in Brooklyn after he departed
                    St. Louis when working in Lowell (see her <a href="duk.00596">June 22,
                        1870</a> letter to Walt). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and

                    at the end of words are sometimes nearly indistinguishable: this is one of those
                    cases. The letter looks more like her typical "r," which might place emphasis on
                    fixing up the house (removing carpet, putting up paper, cleaning) so that George
                    Washington Whitman could sell it and "clear" a profit. Or she may have
                    considered carpet removal and scrubbing as making the section of the house more
                    presentable for tenants, as cleaning it. Whether new tenants were sought for a
                    section of the Portland Avenue house or she was working on another property in
                    George's housebuilding business is not known. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li></ul>
