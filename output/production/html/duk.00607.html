            than when i last heard) neither
            have i heard from georgey
            he left some money for me to
            put in the bank as the bank was
            shut when he came from new york
            after i put it in he wanted me to
            send him a line of the amount invested
            as the bank book was at the bank to
            have the interest cast up so i got the
            man to put it on a paper the whole
            amount and i sent it to him</p>

            every cent of it on the house)
            and he
            dident give me a cent the two last
            times he was home he asked me if
            i wanted any of course i said no
            as he took out 30 dollars and said to
            his wife that had to last or asked her
            if it would last them a month she said
            they would get some from lowel
            i said i had an order from walt
            that would last me) but walt for
            all that George would never se me
            want i have too high an opinion of
            him to think he would ever shirk in any
            way if i was needy) but they want very
