                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman:—</span>
            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Your beautiful gift rec'd. I gloated and gloated over it.
                Such a precious memento! How we ought to love each other, &amp; draw closer &amp;
                closer in manly friendship—all of us who think &amp; believe the same things
                of the universe &amp; man. There is a mystery back of the visible, I am confident
                All matter seems to me instinct w. latent consciousness. Those Platonic remembrances
                the dim pre-natal consciousness carried over thro' the seminal germ of
                foetus—very remarkable psychological fact—only showing the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">delicate</span> character of matter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thank you very much for the valuable &amp; remarkably vigorous little <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Ilias-in-nuce</span> sketch of Whittier. It is worth all of my book put together. You make me
                jealous—you man of great power—you <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">smite</span> home with such resistless power, &amp;
                graphic-picturesque words. I am going to quote what you say of Whittier. It's all
                right just what you w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> say in print.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am having a grand visit from a cousin. A real Western woman.—A Woodruff (you
                may have known one kinsman (cousin) Judge Lewis B. Woodruff of New York
                Circuit-Court, highly revered man for his probity &amp; his legal decisions). This

            Woodruff McDowell, fr' the Western Reserve is one of those marvellous, energetic
                Western girls—wrapped in their purity as armor, who go out &amp; locate land,
                farm their own living, &amp; travel alone around the continent,—&amp; lose no
                feminine charm. The world can't beat it!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">She brought in her trunk some calamus root which she boiled in maple sugar up in
                Vermont on a sugar ranche of her mother-in-law. I send you a little snip dear dad.
                Prost! I also send you per express paid a couple of jars of my nice currant jam put
                up by myself fr fruit raised by me here.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Sorry indeed to hear of increase of that little deafness, &amp; of yr eyes. Keep a
                grand heart</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hattie brings me a long letter of Jesse R. Grant, the General's father, addressed to
                my great uncle Granger, (Judge William G. of Ohio very wealthy now deceased). Jesse
                came very near marrying my uncle's sister he says. I may publish the letter. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">So keep mum</span>. Curious to think what wd hv. been the fate of
                the U.S. if he <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">had</span> married Eliza G.!</p>
