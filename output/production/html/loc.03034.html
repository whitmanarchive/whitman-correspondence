                spells—had one ten or twelve days last of August—but then they ease up
                quite perceptibly—was easier for five days, &amp; now am passing a rather
                depress'd time again—probably to be follow'd by a sort of let up—&amp;

                is still at North Perry, Maine (&amp; if convenient after you have got &amp; read
                the "Liberty" I speak of, send it to Mrs: O'C—just the place, only,

                    Costelloe, in Eng:—Did you come across the
                French book, Sarrazin's, yet? "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poetes
