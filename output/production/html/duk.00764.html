                    Stansberry, a former soldier whom Whitman had met in Armory Square Hospital,
                    wrote on <a href="duk.00765">December 9, 1873</a>, from Howard Lake,
                    Minn., and recalled "the Blackbery [Jam?] you gave me &amp; all the kindness
                    which you shown." After Whitman replied on April 27, 1874 (lost), Stansberry
                    wrote again on <a href="duk.00766">May 12, 1874</a>, about the hospital
                    visits. On <a href="duk.00767">June 28, 1874</a>, he thanked Whitman for
                    his letter and "22 News <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pappers​ </span></span>." 
                    Evidently in reply to another lost letter from
                    Whitman, Stansberry asked on <a href="duk.00768">July 21, 1875</a>, for
                    "the Lone of 65$" in order to return to West Virginia, where he expected to
                    find witnesses to support his application for a pension. This was evidently the
                    last letter in the correspondence. See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt
