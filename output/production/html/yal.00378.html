            <p class="tei_p">Your welcome letter was duly received for which accept many thanks.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I write now in great haste to ask your assistance in behalf of Our Ruffle
                Manufacture and if you succeed in doing what we ask, or in getting it done I am
                authorised to offer you a 1000 dollar check as soon as it is done! think of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span>. It is only a simple act of justice that we ask 
                either</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The committee have just <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">revised</span> the law concerning the "internal Revenue tax and "articles of
                clothing made by sewing from materials already having payed tax are exempted we thought our goods came under that head and rejoiced
                greatly but the Assesor says <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> so

            Our Manufacture bring <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">trimmings</span> to clothing and not
                clothing. Now altho we got the article patented and have tried in vain to defend the patent
                and put down infringers by law. The article is made in secret by unprincipled
                parties who do not pay any revenue tax at all, as they make no returns to the
                Internal Revenue Office, but are Jews working in a very underhanded way. Still we
                have to compete in the market with their manufacture. Our company always making
                fair returns each month and paying so large a proportion of the profit as tax, that
                in order to sell as low as those who evade the law, has left us very little scarcely
                enough to encourage

                the manufacture at all. The tax on my part the last year was quite as much as I
                received—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, what we want is to have them the ruffles <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">exempted</span> by
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Committee</span>
                before Congress adjourns either as parts of articles of clothing made by sewing or
                as a special article. They have exempted "step ladders" and several other things
                which I forget now.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You might ask it as "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">parts</span> of articles of clothing such as

                exempted, and I think they will easily put in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ruffles</span> if
                you can hurry up and get at

                you have time enough you can get it done and I shall have the fun of sending you the
