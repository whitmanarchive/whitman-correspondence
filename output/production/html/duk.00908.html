            <p class="tei_p">It is dark &amp; I have had my dinner &amp; am sitting by the fire &amp; gas light—anchor'd &amp;
                tied in my old big democratic chair &amp; room, the same as all summer, now in the fall
                &amp; soon the long winter &amp; (if I live) probably through all—I have been occupied most
                of the afternoon writing my autographs—there are to be 600 for the Edition of my
                complete writings—it will be ab't 900 pages, &amp; include <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span>—a last few ?
                revisions (no changes at all, but a few misprints, brokennesses, &amp; errors
                corrected)—will be an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">authenticated</span> ed'n—You shall have one—I will send one when
                ready—It is slow, but I am in no hurry.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Y'r card came this P. M. but no <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Trans[cript]</span> with notice yet—(will doubtless
                come to-morrow)—No further word from O'C[onnor]. I wait with anxiety—I told you
                ab't my dear friend John Burroughs being here—he is now back at West Park—I hear
                from Dr B[ucke] very often—welcome letters—have been reading Ellis's "Early
                English Metrical Romances" (Bohn's Ed'n)—Miss Pardoe's Louis XIV, and several
                Carlyle books including Mrs. C's Letters—Symonds's "Greek Poets" &amp;c—upon the
                whole, get along &amp; baffle lonesomeness, inertia &amp; the blues. God bless you &amp; the
                wife—</p>
