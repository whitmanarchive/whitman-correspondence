                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    George Stafford (1827–1892) were the parents of Whitman's young friend,
                    Harry Stafford. Whitman often visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek
                    in Laurel Springs (near Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by
                    Herbert Gilchrist; in the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby
                    Glendale. For more, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
