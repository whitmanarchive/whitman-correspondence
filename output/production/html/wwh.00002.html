               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Brother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just finished a letter to mother, and while my hand is in, I will write you a line. I enclose in my letter to Mother, a note from Hyde<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—nothing at all in it, except that Han is well, and comfortably situated—I have not heard a word from home since I left—write me a few words, Jeff, if mother does not,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> and let me know how you all are, and whether you have took the house or given it up.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I suppose of course if every thing was not going on pretty much as usual, some of you would have written to tell me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am having a tolerable fair time here in Boston—not quite enough to occupy me—only two or three hours work a day, reading proof. Still, I am so satisfied at the certainty of having "Leaves of Grass," in a far more complete and favorable form than before, printed and really published, that I don't mind small things. The book will be a very handsome specimen of typography, paper, binding, &amp;c.—and will be, it seems to me, like relieving me of a great weight—or removing a great obstacle that has been in my way for the last three years. The young men that are publishing it treat me in a way I could not wish to have better. They are go-ahead fellows, and don't seem to have the least doubt they are bound to make a good spec. out of my book. It is quite curious, all this should spring up so suddenly, aint it.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very well, and hold my own about as usual. I am stopping at a lodging house, have a very nice room, gas, water, good American folks keep it—I pay $2—eat at restaurant. I get up in the morning, give myself a good wash all over, and currying—then take a walk, often in the Common—then nothing but a cup of coffee generally for my breakfast—then to the stereotype foundry. About 12 I take a walk, and at 2, a good dinner. Not much else, in the way of eating, except that meal.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If I have any thing to communicate, dear brother, I shall write again.</p>

                    landscape painter, was the husband of Hannah Louisa Whitman, Whitman's younger
                    sister. They married in 1852 and lived in Vermont. That there was "nothing at
                    all" in Heyde's letter probably came as a surprise to the Whitmans, since
                    ordinarily he bewailed his lot and disparaged his wife and her erratic behavior.
                    (Heyde was still in a genial mood when he wrote again on <a href="duk.00384">May 18, 1860</a>, to
                    Whitman.
                    Hannah lived in fear of her husband's letters, for he evidently threatened, or
                    so Hannah imagined, to write candidly to her family. On July 21, 1861, for
                    example, Hannah wrote to her mother: "Charlie has taken the greatest aversion to
                    me, no matter what I do it is wrong. I know I should hide his faults. I do feel
                    sensitive about it, no one knows how much so, but I must tell some little things
                    for Charlie said he should write such a letter home that he thought some of you
                    would come after me" (The Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_wwh.00002_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="wwh.00002_n2"><span>Whitman had not received
                    his mother's letter of March 30, 1861 (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
                    University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library), in which
                    she reported that Andrew was recovering from an illness, "made worse," according
                    to Jeff in a letter dated <a href="loc.00392">April 3, 1860</a>, "by an
                    ignorent Dr. and those around him." Louisa Van Velsor Whitman observed that
                    "poor nance . . . looks as she was almost done over," and that "Jess has got to
                    work in the navy yard again." She also requested "5 dollars the first of next

                    house and rented the lower part to a Mr 'John Brown' @ $14 per month". The
                    Browns lived for five years with the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn. He
                    was a tailor. Relations between the two families were sometimes strained; see
                    Whitman's letter from <a href="loc.00813">March 22, 1864</a>
                    . On June 3, 1865,
