            <p class="tei_p">Your letter and Walts came all right and glad enough was I hear that you are getting a little better. You must have had a hard time Mother being sick so long but do not get discouraged and I hope you will soon be as well as ever.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We have Just moved our camp. The place were we were first was a hill without a tree or any sort of shade. were we are now there are plenty of shade trees so that we are very comfortable. I am Just as well and hearty as can be I have slept out in the rain and on the ground but have not felt a bit the worse for it so I think I can go through like a book. When we first came here our camp was fired into for three or four nights in succession  there were four or five shots fired each night and we could hear the balls whiz through the camp but <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00313.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00313.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00313.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>no one was struck. I and half a dozen others were sent out to scout about and see what we could find  we took our pistols and India rubber blankets and lay down in the grass about 200 yards from each other (the place were we are is about like Bedford)  we were out two nights and brought in about a dozen chaps but they were all let go as there was nothing against them but hanging around the camp. I and two others were sent out the other day to <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">arest​ </span><span class="tei_corr">arrest​
        
      </span></span> a secession soldier from Harpers Ferry who it is suposed came on here as a spy. We went out in the city  the chap that gave us the information shewed us the house and we went in and took him and brought him to camp  he was sent to Fort McHenry the same day to be tried for a spy. This city is a regular secession place  as we walk through the streets in the city the Women and children <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00313.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00313.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00313.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>make a regular practice of saying as we pass them hurah for Jeff Davis  the men <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> say anything but you can see by the looks of the most of them that they <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> like us at all. This city was placed under Marshal law yesterday and the celebrated Marshal Kane was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">arested​ </span><span class="tei_corr">arrested​
        
      </span></span> and sent to the Fort. It kicked up quite an excitement in the city but they did not go any further than to stand on the corners and growl. It would not have been well for them to have made any row as there are about 8000 Troops encamped about here with a Splendid Battery of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Artilery​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Artillery​
        
      </span></span> of 8 <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">peices​ </span><span class="tei_corr">pieces​

      </span></span> and they would like very <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">mutch​ </span><span class="tei_corr">much​
