            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing from the army more than you know, in the N Y papers—the fighting has been hard enough, but the papers make lots of additional items, &amp; a good deal that they just entirely make up—there are from 600 to 1000 wounded coming up here—(not 6 to 8000 as the papers have it)<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I cannot hear what part the 9th corps took in the fight, of Friday &amp; afterwards, nor whether they really took any at all—(they, the papers, are determined to make up just any thing)—</p>

                    Whitman's letter is not extant, but Hannah Heyde Whitman wrote, on May 10, 1864,
                    an hysterical letter about George Whitman's safety: "Mother, will you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">be sure</span> and send me word the minute you hear that he is
                    safe. I am like you, I cannot see a bit of peace till I hear. I feel this time
                    as if he would be safe, and, Mother, if he only is, I will try to never complain
                    again of anything as long as I live" (The Library of Congress). Of the Whitmans,
                    only Walt Whitman apparently remained impassive. George had not helped matters
                    when he noted in his letter of <a href="duk.00353">April 29, 1864</a>: "I
                    hear that Grant has issued an order, that no letters will be allowed to be sent
                    from this army for the next Sixty days" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
                    University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
