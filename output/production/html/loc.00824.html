            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing from the army more than you know, in the N Y papers—the fighting has been hard enough, but the papers make lots of additional items, &amp; a good deal that they just entirely make up—there are from 600 to 1000 wounded coming up here—(not 6 to 8000 as the papers have it)—I cannot hear what part the 9th corps took in the fight, of Friday &amp; afterwards, nor whether they really took any at all—(they, the papers, are determined to make up just any thing)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I rec'd your letter &amp; Han's—&amp; was glad indeed to get both—Mother, you must not be under such apprehension, as I think it is not warranted—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">So far as we get news here, we are gaining the day, so far, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">decidedly</span>—if the news we hear is true that Lee has been repulsed &amp; driven back by Grant, &amp; that we are masters of the field, &amp; pursuing them—then I think Lee will retreat, south—&amp; Richmond will be abandoned by the rebs—but of course time only can develope what will happen—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I will write again Wednesday, or before if I hear any thing to write—love to Jeff &amp; Mat &amp; all—</p>
