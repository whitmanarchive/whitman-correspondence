                I respond to that as one to whom it means the life of her Soul. It comforts me very much. You speak in the Preface

                    (1841–1904) was a Welsh explorer best known for his travels through Africa,
                    including a rescue mission he led to find missing Scottish explorer David
                    Livingstone (1813–1873). The New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>
                    reported on July 2, 1872, that Livingstone—almost certainly Gilchrist's

                    November 10, 1871; the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>'s account was one of many

                    "June" rather than "July," as this letter is dated July 14 and therefore makes
                    impossible a copy of an article dated July 29. However, Stanley did not depart
                    for Africa in search of Livingstone until March of 1871, making it possible that
                    the article in question was published in July 1871. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li></ul>
