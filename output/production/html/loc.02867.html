            <p class="tei_p">The 3d July was my rejoicing day, dearest Friend,—the day the packet from America reached me 
                scattering for a while the clouds of pain and humiliation &amp; filling me through &amp; through 
                with light &amp; warmth: indeed I believe I am often as happy reading as you were writing your Poems. 
                The long new one "As a Strong Bird" of itself answers the question hinted

                For me, the most precious page in the book is that which contains the Democratic Souvenirs.
                I respond to that as one to whom it means the life of her Soul. It comforts me very much. You speak in the Preface 
                of the imperious &amp; resistless command from within out of which Leaves of Grass issued. This carried 
                with it no doubt the secret of a corresponding resistless power over the reader wholly unprecedented 
                unapproached in literature as I believe, &amp; to be compared

                only with that of Christ. I speak out of my own experience when I say that no Myth, no "miracle" embodying 
                the notion of a direct communication between God &amp; a human creature, goes beyond the effect soul 
                &amp; body, of those Poems on me: &amp; that were I to put into oriental forms of speech what I experienced 
                it would read like one of those old "miracles" or "myths. Thus of many things that used to appear to me

                perceive the germ of truth &amp; understand that what was called the supernatural was merely an inadequate

                simple truth to say I died of joy. The doctor called it nervous exhaustion falling with tremendous violence 
                on the heart which "seemed to have been strained": &amp; was much puzzled how that could have come to pass. 
                I left him in his puzzle, but it was none to me—How could such

                a dazzling radiance of light flooding the soul, suddenly kindling it to such an intense life, but put a 
                tremendous strain on the vital organs? how could the muscles of the heart suddenly grow adequate to such 
                new work—O the passionate tender gratitude that flooded my breast, the yearning that seemed to strain 
                the heart beyond endurance that I might repay with all my life &amp; soul &amp; body This debt—that
