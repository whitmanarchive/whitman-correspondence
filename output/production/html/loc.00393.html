               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Brother Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was at home yesterday as usual  everything is going on about the same. Andrew has recovered in a great measure,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> so that he sits up and would probably have been out-doors but the weather has been very wet and cold here for the last week. Mother herself I think is not very well. she has a bad cold that seems to pull her down. I have got one of the worst colds I ever had, and feel extremely unlike myself, still anything of that kind sits lighter on me than on one of Mother's age, and this morning Ed. seemed to be quite sick, that is he couldn't eat and complained of a bad pain in his side, however Mother put a mustard plaster on him and he felt considerably better when I left home.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mattie and George, the rest of "the family" are well. The Mr Brown<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> who has rented the lower part of the house has sent a number of things to the house, carpets &amp;c. Mother has let him fix the front parlor and she has emigrated and taken posession of your room. The Moore people<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> have not moved yet, and I believe do not intend to till 7 of May</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Water Works men are all trembling in our boots, the [prospects?] being that we are all going to be kicked out, neck and heels, from the chief down to the Axeman. It seems that Mr F. Spinola<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> started a bill at Albany some time last winter trying to oust the new commissioners (King, Lewis &amp;c &amp;c)<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>  well someone made an amendment casting out the present old Com. the new Com. Chief Eng. &amp;c all the way through, and appointing Mr McElroy<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> in place of Mr Kirkwood.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> It has passed one house, and I guess the chances are abt even for its passing the other, as Wells the Contractor<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> is helping it with all the power he can muster. I think it will be a dark day for the B. W. W. if he succeeds, but I suppose to the victor belongs the spoils. I know I ain't going to worry, if it does go through.<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother wants me to be sure and tell you that you must bring her one of those books by the authoress of "Consuelo"<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> also Redpath's "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Brown</span>"<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a>  she says you needn't send them as that would involve cost, but to surely remember to bring them with you when you come home.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I read your letter at home.<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a> I am glad that you are having so good a time and that your book has such a good prospect of success. I sincerely hope you will meet with no disappointment.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Write me again Walt. I like much to hear how you are getting along. I shall write to you again probably next week. Mattie sends her love.</p>

                    commenced by a very violent pain in the side, kept up and made worse by an
                    ignorent Dr. and those around him." An alcoholic, Andrew would die of

                    Brooklyn Water Works as chief engineer from 1856 to 1862. After his work in
                    Brooklyn, he moved to St. Louis and designed the waterworks which Jeff would
                    later build. Kirkwood eventually became a nationally known independent
