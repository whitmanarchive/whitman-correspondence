                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr Whitman,</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thy cheering card of March 2nd<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> came today, just as I am starting off for the country with the babies.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a> 
                It is always cheering to hear from thee, thy messages bring a breath of fresh air. It is the best object lesson that any one 
                could possibly have to read <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">they​ </span></span> description of thyself as in buoyant spirits. It always helps me to see thy handwriting and to 
                read thy words.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very busy as usual. England is not like America "taking stock" and resting, it is on the contrary very 
                active politically. I am sending the the "Review of Reviews,"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> that most interesting of journals. I wish thee would write a letter to 
                the editor. He would be sure to print it. Women are taking their share here in all that <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">it​ </span></span> going on, but this means of course a 
                great deal of work for those who are most interested in things. I have not time to send a longer letter now but I will write soon again.</p>

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    and women's suffrage activist who ran for a seat in the British parliament soon
