                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr Whitman,</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thy cheering card of March 2nd came today, just as I am starting off for the country with the babies. 
                It is always cheering to hear from thee, thy messages bring a breath of fresh air. It is the best object lesson that any one 
                could possibly have to read <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">they​ </span><span class="tei_corr">thy​
        
      </span></span> description of thyself as in buoyant spirits. It always helps me to see thy handwriting and to 
                read thy words.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very busy as usual. England is not like America "taking stock" and resting, it is on the contrary very 
                active politically. I am sending the the "Review of Reviews," that most interesting of journals. I wish thee would write a letter to 
                the editor. He would be sure to print it. Women are taking their share here in all that <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">it​ </span><span class="tei_corr">is​
        
      </span></span> going on, but this means of course a 
                great deal of work for those who are most interested in things. I have not time to send a longer letter now but I will write soon again.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">With love</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Thy friend</span>
