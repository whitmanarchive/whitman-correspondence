            <p class="tei_p">Yours of Saturday and Sunday just to hand. I am much
                pleased to hear you speak so definitely about the new book. The big book ought to
                have been $10. instead of $6. that would have left margin enough for every thing and
                it is my belief that it would have sold about as freely at the larger price as the
                smaller. $5. for the new book is not too much but it is out of all proportion to $6.
                for the Complete works. Why not date the little book on title page "30 May 1889" or
                better date it in M.S. along with autograph?</p>
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">"Walt Whitman</li><li class="tei_item">31 May 1889"?</li></ul>
            <p class="tei_p">That would be a splendid souvenir. I am rejoiced to hear
                that Ed. has resumed the semi massage</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I do not wonder that M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span>Kay "declines
                your proposition" the price of the book once established cannot well be changed and
                if M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span>K paid $3.33 and $1.28 for binding = $4.61 he would
                have too little profit.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new here, all hearty</p>
