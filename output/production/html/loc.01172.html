            <p class="tei_p">I have been back home since 21st of July. I had to come back to look after my farm. The heavy rains came near 
                washing it away. Wife &amp; Julian are still up in the mountains &amp; are well. I &amp; my man live alone in the 
                old house, I am chief cook &amp; bottle washer I keep well &amp; busy, &amp; am not having a very bad time<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01172.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01172.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01172.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                after all. In a couple of weeks my grapes will be all off (only 1/2 crop this year) &amp; I shall take another holiday</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hope to see you in Sept, I trust you keep well as usual. I rec'd a letter from you at Hobart which I sent on to
