                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    traveled to the United States, arriving at Philadelphia on September 8, 1891
                    (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.210.html">Tuesday, September 8, 1891</a>). Wallace's arrival was shortly preceded
                    by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had recently
                    returned from two months of travel in Europe, where he had spent time with
                    Johnston, Wallace, and the Bolton College group of English Whitman admirers.
                    Both Bucke and Wallace visited Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days
                    with the poet, Wallace returned with Bucke to London, Ontario, Canada, where he
                    met Bucke's family and friends. Wallace's account of his time with Whitman was
                    published—along with the Bolton physician John Johnston's account of his
                    own visit with the poet in the summer of 1890—in their memoir, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex, called "Sands at Seventy," consisted of

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
