                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
                    often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the

                    (1869–1902?) was Whitman's young Camden friend, who drove the poet's horse
                    and buggy, lived for a while in Whitman's house, and accompanied Whitman on
                    numerous trips. Duckett later established a career in the telegraphy industry;
                    he lived and worked in Ohio and North Carolina before passing away in his native
                    Philadelphia as a result of alcoholism in about 1902. For more information on

                    tremendous success, and Whitman was so showered with adulation that he observed
                    in his Commonplace Book, "If I had staid longer, I sh'd have been killed with
                    kindness &amp; compliments." The arrangements for the lecture were made by John
                    H. Johnston; see his letter to Whitman on <a href="loc.07367">March
                    24</a>. The poet stayed at the Westminster Hotel in a suite once occupied by
                    the British novelist Charles Dickens. On April 13, Whitman was visited in the
                    suite by friends, including Johnston, Burroughs, the writer Edmund Clarence
                    Steadman, and the editor Richard Watson Gilder. At the Madison-Square Theatre on
                    the following day, he was escorted on stage by Duckett and gave his lecture
                    before an audience that included the poet James Russell Lowell, the statesman
                    John Hay, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and the industrialist and
                    philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. After his speech he received "two or more
                    hundred friends" at the Hotel, appearing a "little fatigued," according to the
                    New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening Sun</span>. On the following day, he sat for G.
                    C. Cox, the photographer, and Dora Wheeler, "portrait painter" (Clara Barrus,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston,
                    Houghton Mifflin, 1931], 264–265). A lengthy notice appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> on April 15. For this lecture, Whitman
                    received $600, $250 from the sale of tickets and $350 from Carnegie.
