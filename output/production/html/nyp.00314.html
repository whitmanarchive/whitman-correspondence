        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I will not write much to-day, as I have just come in from being out over two hours, 
        &amp; I feel quite tired. I cannot walk any to speak of, but I have been out taking a 
        ride in the cars, and sitting in the parks a little while. Peter Doyle has been with me. 
        It is as pleasant and warm as summer here to-day. I have not rec'd any letters for the last two days—
        I suppose you got my letter Saturday—I have been out more to-day than any day yet, 
        as it has been so warm &amp; fine—Love to you, mama dear, &amp; to all—
      </p>

        <p class="tei_p">Mother, write me what envelopes you would like to have me direct, &amp; enclose you—
          I have not been over to the office yet, except that one time ten or twelve days ago.
        </p>
