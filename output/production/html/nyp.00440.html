                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 20th recd—At this present writing I don't think the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> will print
                your letter at all—if it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> appear next Sunday,
                I doubt if it appears at all—the course of the T[ribune] towards me I think
                has been left to Wm Winter, who I have no doubt writes the squib in T. of 24th May—&amp; also wrote (may be in conjunction with R H Stoddard,) the notice of L of G in T. four or five months
                ago—After Stedman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner</span> article a year or two ago
                the T. extracted half a column of his condemnatory views &amp; opinions on my
                treatment of amativeness in L of G.—a few days
                afterward, an extract, offering third of a column from Mrs Gilchrists <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Woman's Estimate</span> was sent Reid, but he refused to print
                    it—I think, at present at any rate, that
                indicates their stand—(expediency, popular current &amp;c)—carrying
                out the old enmity of Bayard Taylor, &amp;c
                &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have you seen Dr Bucke's letter in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Springfield Republican</span> of
                May 23—and the vigorous editorial same number? The
                Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> May 24 (Supplement) takes the same ground—both editorials would satisfy you
                perfectly—Shouldnt at all wonder if your guess about Rev T W Higginson hits the nail—one nail—exactly on the
                head.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your line about the Emerson talk on the Common &amp;c is
                very opportune—it was as you say—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">essential</span>
                matter, at the spine or abysm of all, such as the Bible often presents &amp; in all
                primal poetry &amp; attempt at returning to Creation's birth-innocence—let
                alone my attempt at the same result, based on modern science, biology &amp;
                physiology—was not touched upon at all by Emerson—but it was a splendid
                &amp; most sincere unfolding of the technical esthetic &amp; conventional &amp;
                technical literary points applicable—But you know, dear friend, my plan
                (hobby) is never to shirk the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">enemys​ </span><span class="tei_corr">enemy's​
        
      </span></span> fullest tactics but to state them over again if
                possible better than ever—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I shall mind your admonition
                    though</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As things are, I don't feel any resentment at all toward Osgood &amp; Co. A sharp
                friend here suggests that they themselves (O &amp; Co) had some hand in the
                Marston-Stevens proceeding &amp; rather egged it on—that they were losing,
                paying me 25 cts royalty, &amp;c &amp;c—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">But I havn't the least idea of any such thing</span>—I only mention it because
                I shouldn't wonder if it came up that way &amp; you will hear it broached—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dr Bucke is absent in Ottawa, Canada—from there he goes to
                Cincinnati—John Burroughs I suppose is in England—(he went off in a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">depress'd​ </span><span class="tei_corr">depressed​
        
      </span></span> humor—blue as indigo)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I write—Thursday forenoon—it is raining again, with east wind &amp;
                the heavens all lead-colored—but I am feeling well as usual &amp; in good
                spirits—Sometimes I feel to welcome any <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whack</span> that
                breaks the stupid monotony even of life's prosperous evenness—&amp; as to this
                last &amp; in some sense most marked buffeting in the fortunes of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—why—if it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">cant​ </span><span class="tei_corr">can't​
        
      </span></span> stand it &amp; throw it off
                &amp; go on better than ever, why let it go under—of which I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">havn't​ </span><span class="tei_corr">haven't​
        
      </span></span> the
                slightest idea though—but I feel sure the book will gather added, perhaps a
                main part, interest, from what it has gone through, from association—&amp; I
                shall too—I tickle myself with the thought how it may be said years hence that
                at any rate <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no book on earth ever had such a
                history</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall keep you advised if I hear any thing—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I have just had the Tribune of to-day, in which I find <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the
                        letter</span>—I don't know but Charles Eldridge was right—Being so much interested perhaps I am not a
                    fair judge—but if ever Jupiter went into the press hurling the lightnings
                    (&amp; yet a sort of Jovian continence) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this letter</span> has
                    got him in—It is apparently printed with wonderful correctness—don't
                    need a single alteration—it will live in literature at least as long as
                    Junius—God bless you—</p>
