            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of July 21 just rec'd, soliciting some definite word from me ab't an English or
                transatlantic "free will offering"—a proposed affectionate and voluntary gift
                to me from my friends there.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I feel deeply, even for the
                prompting of it, and should decidedly and gratefully accept any thing it produces.
                (My publisher David McKay, of Philadelphia, has just been over to pay the last
                half-annual royalty on my two Volumes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> and
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Specimen Days</span>, which amounted to twenty-two dollars
                and six cents—this being the income to me from the sale of my books for the
                last six months.)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Fearfully hot weather here. I have had a sunstroke which has made me weak, and kept
                me indoors for the last twelve days; but I move around the house, eat my rations
                fairly, write a little, and shall quite certainly soon resume my usual state of
                health, late times—(doubtless lower'd a slight notch or two, as I find that is
                the way things go on year after year.) Fortunately I have a good faithful young
                Jersey woman and friend, Mary Davis, who cooks for me, and vigilantly sees to
                me.<a href="#n6113" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6113">4</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to Wm M. Rossetti<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> and to all enquiring
                friends, known or unknown.</p>

                    poet, spoke of the eagerness of many young men in England to show their
                    affection for Whitman. For this reason they inserted a paragraph in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Athenaeum</span> on July 11 soliciting funds, but were
                    disturbed by a notice in the Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Post</span> of July 3
                    "which seems decisively to bid us desist!" The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Post</span>

                    quoted: "My income is just sufficient to keep my head above water—and what
                    more can a poet ask?" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Athenaeum</span> said in part: "The
                    poet is in his sixty-seventh year, and has . . . maintained himself precariously
                    by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by occasional contributions to
