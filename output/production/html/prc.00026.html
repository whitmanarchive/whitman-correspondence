        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter yesterday, and was particularly pleased to get it, bringing late 
        intelligence about you all. It was a good letter. What you say about William, fagged 
        with work &amp; I suppose the weather—&amp; Nelly, half-sick, &amp; Jennie about the same (but 
        she will soon spring up)—aroused my sympathies—Mother &amp; I talked about them all—I send love to all. Nelly, I shall return next week, &amp; then I shall surely come to 
        the house, &amp; see you &amp; all.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, I went leisurely up the Connecticut valley, by way of Springfield, through 
        the best part (agriculturally, &amp; other) of Massachusetts, Connecticut &amp; New Hampshire, 
        June 24th &amp; 25th by day light—26th &amp; 27th at Hanover, N.H.—28th &amp; 29th slowly up the 
        White River valley, a captivating wild region, by Vermont Central R.R. &amp; so to Burlington, 
        &amp; about Lake Champlain where I spent a week, filling myself every day, (especially mornings 
        &amp; sunsets) with the grandest ensembles of the Adirondacks always on one side, and the Green 
        Mountains on the other—sailed after that down Champlain by day—stopt at Albany over night, 
        &amp; down the Hudson by boat, 4th of July, through a succession of splendid &amp; magnificent 
        thunderstorms (10 or 12 of them) alternated by spells of clearest sunlight—Then home 
        some five or six days—immediately following I was ill, real ill—I suppose the excessive 
        heat, &amp;c &amp;c—but am now feeling all right.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Upon the whole, I have stood the unprecedented heat pretty well. Mother is not very well—has spells of weakness—has rheumatism—then good days again—will break up from Brooklyn 
        in September, &amp; go with George, at Camden—as they are vehement for it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">My sister Martha at St. Louis is better far than one would expect, after the alarm 
        of two months ago—she has since no trouble with the cancer, (or supposed cancer)—Jeff &amp; the children well—My sister Hannah, (Mrs Heyde,) in Burlington, I found 
        better than I had anticipated—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">every thing much better</span>—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, who do you think I have been spending some three hours with to-day, 
        from 12 to 3—(it is now 4½)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Joaquin Miller</span>—He saw me yesterday toward dusk 
        at 5th av. on a stage, &amp; rushed out of the house, &amp; mounting the stage gave me his address, 
        &amp; made an appointment—he lives here 34th st. in furnished rooms—I am much pleased, 
        (upon the whole) with him—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">really pleased &amp; satisfied</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his presence, conversation, atmosphere</span>, are infinitely more 
        satisfying than his poetry—he is, however, mopish, 
        <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ennuyeed​ </span><span class="tei_corr">ennuied​
        
      </span></span>, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">California Hamlet</span>, unhappy every where—but a natural prince, may-be an 
        illiterate one—but tender, sweet, &amp; magnetic—Love to you, dear Charley, &amp; to all—I will soon be with you again—</p>
