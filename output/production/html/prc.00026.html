        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter yesterday, and was particularly pleased to get it, bringing late 
        intelligence about you all. It was a good letter. What you say about William, fagged 
        with work &amp; I suppose the weather—&amp; Nelly, half-sick, &amp; Jennie about the same (but 
        she will soon spring up)—aroused my sympathies—Mother &amp; I talked about them all—I send love to all. Nelly, I shall return next week, &amp; then I shall surely come to 
        the house, &amp; see you &amp; all.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, I went leisurely up the Connecticut valley, by way of Springfield, through 
        the best part (agriculturally, &amp; other) of Massachusetts, Connecticut &amp; New Hampshire, 
        June 24th &amp; 25th by day light—26th &amp; 27th at Hanover, N.H.—28th &amp; 29th slowly up the 
        White River valley, a captivating wild region, by Vermont Central R.R. &amp; so to Burlington, 
        &amp; about Lake Champlain where I spent a week, filling myself every day, (especially mornings 
        &amp; sunsets) with the grandest ensembles of the Adirondacks always on one side, and the Green 
        Mountains on the other—sailed after that down Champlain by day—stopt at Albany over night, 
        &amp; down the Hudson by boat, 4th of July, through a succession of splendid &amp; magnificent 
        thunderstorms (10 or 12 of them) alternated by spells of clearest sunlight—Then home 
        some five or six days—immediately following I was ill, real ill—I suppose the excessive 
        heat, &amp;c &amp;c—but am now feeling all right.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Upon the whole, I have stood the unprecedented heat pretty well. Mother is not very well—has spells of weakness—has rheumatism—then good days again—will break up from Brooklyn 
        in September, &amp; go with George, at Camden—as they are vehement for it.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">My sister Martha at St. Louis is better far than one would expect, after the alarm 
        of two months ago<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—she has since no trouble with the cancer, (or supposed cancer)—Jeff &amp; the children well—My sister Hannah, (Mrs Heyde,) in Burlington, I found 
        better than I had anticipated—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">every thing much better</span><a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, who do you think I have been spending some three hours with to-day, 
        from 12 to 3—(it is now 4½)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Joaquin Miller</span><a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—He saw me yesterday toward dusk 
        at 5th av. on a stage, &amp; rushed out of the house, &amp; mounting the stage gave me his address, 
        &amp; made an appointment—he lives here 34th st. in furnished rooms—I am much pleased, 
        (upon the whole) with him—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">really pleased &amp; satisfied</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his presence, conversation, atmosphere</span>, are infinitely more 
        satisfying than his poetry—he is, however, mopish, 
        <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ennuyeed​ </span></span>, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">California Hamlet</span>, unhappy every where—but a natural prince, may-be an 
        illiterate one—but tender, sweet, &amp; magnetic—Love to you, dear Charley, &amp; to all—I will soon be with you again—</p>

                    "Interviews with Joaquin Miller," Whitman characterized him as "an ardent,

                    favorable impression on me)" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman
                    also wrote of this meeting in his <a href="loc.01738">July 19, 1872</a>
