                    was the son of Christopher Smith (1801–1871), a farmer, and Maria Smith (1811–1887).
                    Bethuel Smith served in the Union Army—Company F, Second U.S. Cavalry—during the Civil War.
                    Smith was wounded in 1863 and taken to Armory Square Hospital in Washington, D. C., where he met Whitman.
                    Smith wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.00596">September 17, 1863</a>, from the U.S. General Hospital
                    at Carlisle, Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
                    He expected, he explained on <a href="loc.00598">September 28, 1863</a>,
                    to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
                    on <a href="loc.00889">October 13, 1863</a>. He wrote on <a href="loc.00601">December 16, 1863</a>, from Culpeper, Virginia, that he
                    was doing provost duty, and on <a href="loc.00602">February 28, 1864</a>,
                    he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry
                    hard." He was wounded again on June 11 (so his parents reported to Whitman on
                    <a href="loc.00603">August 29, 1864</a>), was transported to
                    Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to
                    Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30, 1864</a>, he
                    wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have drempt of you
                    often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave the next day for
                    Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on <a href="loc.00882">October 22,
                        1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman from Queensbury, New York. When his parents
                    communicated with Whitman on <a href="loc.00605">January 26,
                        1865</a>, Bethuel was well enough to perform tasks on the farm. Smith
                    recovered from his injuries and went on to marry Lois E. Chadwick Smith (1845–1911).
                    The couple had six children. Smith was one
                    of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote in the 1870s; see Whitman's letter to
