          <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter has reached me here, &amp; it is a real comfort to hear from Bethuel once more. Years have passed away 
        but I find there is something in the friendship formed amid sickness, or with the wounded in hospital 
        that comes up again fresh and living as ever and remains as if it cannot pass away. Bethuel, dear comrade, 
        I must write a few <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">​ </span><span class="tei_corr">lines​
        
      </span></span> how I should like to see you. I want to hear all about you, &amp; how you are 
        getting along—all the particulars will be interesting—when I think of those old times in the hospital 
        &amp; our being together, you seem to me like my own son.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I worked in Washington after the war—had a stroke of paralysis now two years since, was getting better, 
        then some serious troubles happened to me, &amp; I fell back again—I have left Brooklyn &amp; Washington for good—&amp; am now laid up here—I am neither well enough to do any work, nor sick enough to give up—go out some 
        though lame, &amp; keep a pretty good heart, hoping for better times. Bethuel, I enclose an envelope for you—dear boy, I want you to write me a good long letter—my best best love to you, &amp; a happy new year—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Mrs. Smith, I thank you for writing to me, it has done me good—I send my best respects &amp; love to you—&amp; my love 
        to the youngest son living with you. I will send some papers.
      </p>
