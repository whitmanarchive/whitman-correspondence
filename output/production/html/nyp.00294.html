            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I write a line just to give an account of myself. I am well as usual, &amp; in good spirits. 
                My Mother, brother George, &amp; all, are well. I came through finely on the RR. last Wednesday—&amp; found myself received very agreebly just as I crossed Jersey flats, approaching New York, 
                by an entire <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">change in the weather</span>—the distressing heat gone—&amp; in its place summer atmosphere, 
                of course, but moderate enough—which has continued every day since. I enjoy it all, home here, 
                day &amp; night—especially the nights—which are fine.

</p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">I hear that Wm Swinton<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is here, from California. Your name was just mentioned on the editorial page 
                of last Saturday's (I believe Saturday's) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I have seen Mrs. Price, she is ill with asthma. 
                Her daughter Emily<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> has had a fine little baby boy, now about a month resident in this mad world—(I write about the baby for Nelly and Jenny)—My sister Martha &amp; the children have migrated from St. Louis 
                to St. Paul, (Iowa) for a few weeks. They are as well as usual.
</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am quite busy flying around—the printers &amp; stereotypers commence on my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immortal work</span> to-morrow—My dear, dear friend, I hope you are well &amp; in good spirits—I send you my love—also to Charles Eldridge, 
                if he is there—the package of letters &amp; paper came promptly—&amp; I will heartily thank you to continue 
                watching the letters &amp;c. and forwarding them to me in same manner—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Please enclose this in your next letter to Nelly—Nelly, my darling, I hope you are having comfortable times, 
                &amp; that all goes well—&amp; Jeannie too—I think often about you both—&amp; send you my best love—in which I am joined by my Mother.
