Bergen (1806–1881) 
                    was a Brooklyn official acquainted with Whitman. Bergen was a member
                    of the 241st regiment of the New York State militia, where he achieved the rank of Colonel. 
                    Trained as a surveyor, Bergen enjoyed
                    a succesful career in the field before turning to politics. He served on the
                    Kings County Board of Supervisors as the Supervisor of New Utrecht for
                    twenty-three years (1836–1859). In 1864, Bergen was elected to the United
                    States House of Representatives as a Democrat. He held this
                    office until 1867. In one of his "Paragraph Sketches of Brooklynites," published in the 
                    Brooklyn <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Advertiser</span> on June 1, 1850, Whitman 
                    characterized Bergen as "the Nestor of the Board of Supervisors," and noted
                    that he had been "a very Cerberus in his watch over the Treasury" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 1:37, n1). </span></span> [<a href="#r">back</a>]</li></ul>
