            <p class="tei_p">Well, mama dear, Christmas day is finished, &amp; I thought I would just send you a line—We have had a mild day, as warm as spring—I took dinner at O'Connor's by invitation—we had an excellent dinner—I am invited to Dr. Channings this evening, but I hardly feel like going, &amp; shall not go—They are very clever people, &amp; have invited me to Newport next summer—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am writing this in the office, (alone in my own room)—I have just time to catch the mail—I hope you have had a nice Christmas, mama dear—May be George &amp; Lou are with you—(I hope you will all take a glass of the Spanish wine)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I believe I told you in my last that I wrote to Martha and Han—Good bye, mama dear, for this time, &amp; Love to you &amp; Lou &amp; all—</p>
