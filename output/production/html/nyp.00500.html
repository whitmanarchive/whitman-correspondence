            <p class="tei_p">The following answer of mine to an article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nation</span> of
                July 26 having been refused publication by that paper, it is sent to you, not in any
                controversial spirit, but because the facts I give are of current interest, and
                should be kept well before the American public, especially the New York portion of
                it. Washington Sept: 1883</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suggest that you send it to the N. Y. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> for their Sunday
                edition—with the preceding note—Dana I think is more or less
                friendly—</p>
