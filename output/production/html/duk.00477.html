                has been gone to philadelphe
                most a week Jeff
                came home last night but
            mat dident come they were to come tuesday
            or wensday sure i dont think they will come
            such a game over me again she has no girl

            cousin has been here come the same night they
            went and staid till monday then he came again
            last night but Jeff helped me get breakfast
            this morning i hope mat will come to morrow
            they think its all nothing i dont even get thanked
            i have been left so much alone here this winter
            they leave me a whissel to blow three times
                if any body comes to break in davis says the
            watchmen will come over if i blow three times
            i told him i should be more afraid of
            the watchmen than i should of the burglars
            i dont suppose there is any danger but
            it is very dreary up here in cold winter
            nights i am most afraid of fire but it
            will be spring one of these days i hope) its very
            cold here to night hattee is setting one side
            of me and Edd the other Jeff and davis has
            gone away to be out very late)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i forgot to tell you when i wrote last Emma

            epistle from him but mine was quite moderate

            winter but he dident direct it right so he
            thinks i dident get it but i did it was very
            long it treated mostly about a rabbitt in the
                wood house i must write to han
                as soon as i
            can my arm keeps lame yet it gets up my
            arm more i got your letter yesterday
            walt with the money all safe if you
            can walt just as well as not in about
            two weeks send me ten dollars i have
            bought a barrel of flour and am to pay him
            five dollars and he is to wait two weeks
            for the ten  so walt if you can send it
            by that time i would be glad) there was
            something i wanted to tell you i thought
                off to day but i cant think what it is nothin
            of great importance or i could think of it
            we have got a lot of little chickens was
            haching when they went away so we had
            to fetch them in some died hattie buried one
            after she covered it up she asked me if i
            thought it would go to heaven hattie is
            a very smart child if she had the right tutoring
            i doo hope when mat comes home she will
            settle down they have went it this winter
            if they never did before walt i think when you
            read this you l say mother is getting childish
