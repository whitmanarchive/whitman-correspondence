                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken

                    (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
                    (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont.
                    Heyde wrote to Walt Whitman in regard to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman earlier in
                    March 1867: "It is reasonable to anticipate from Mrs Whitman's past robustness,
                    and present approaching infirmities, that she will never undergo protracted
                    sickness, but her demise, when it does take place, will occur in a brief period.
                    It may so happen that Hannah may not be permitted to see her mother again."
                    Heyde complained also that Hannah's lack of "outward sentiment or sympathy" had
                    made it "impossible for me to respect her" (Charles L. Heyde, March 1867 letter
                    to Walt Whitman, Trent Collection, Duke University). On <a href="duk.00645">March 26, 1867</a>, Walt wrote to his mother: "I have rec'd another
                    epistle from Heyde—one of his regular damned fool's letters—I never
                    answer them, nor make any allusion to them—it was full of
                    complaints—." Heyde complained of Hannah's sloppy attire ("her appearance
                    would disgrace any servant in the vicinity"), her laziness, her lack of "womanly
                    sensibility . . . and intellectual imbecility" (Trent Collection, Duke
                    University). </span></span> [<a href="#r9">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">10. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00477_n10 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00477_n10"><span>Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
                    Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's youngest daughter, resided
                    in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband Charles L. Heyde. Charles Heyde was
                    infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
                    Hannah. The animal that Heyde described in his letter was a small brown
                    squirrel, not a rabbit as Louisa wrote here (see Charles L. Heyde's January 1867
                    letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Duke University, Trent Collection). Louisa
                    had previously noted her receipt of Heyde's January letter and his description
                    of the animal she mistakenly designated a "rabbit" (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00469">January 17, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman). </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li></ul>
