                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>      
            <p class="tei_p">I can hardly understand how I have left your most welcome letter so long unanswered.
                In Paris two months ago I saw one morning in a newspaper that "The American Poet,
                Walt Whitman would shortly visit England", &amp; there &amp; then I sat down &amp;
                wrote part of a letter to you, but the weariness of illness (I was ailing a good
                deal) caused it to remain unended &amp; unsent. Now I have just heard from Mr.
                Burroughs that there is, or may be, a fair chance of your coming 
                to us, &amp; of your giving readings from your poems. As far as my own opinion goes, 
                I would say that there is a certainty of success, a sufficient success at the least, 
                &amp; perhaps a complete one, in Dublin. Do come. You do not know how welcome you 
                would be to many of us. I need not say 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01492.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01492.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01492.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                that if you would come to our house in Dublin my wife &amp; I would be made abundantly 
                happy, &amp; would remember 1872 as a year good to think of.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There are several things for which I owe you thanks—two copies of "Democratic
                Vistas" &amp; newspapers from time to time. Each I assure you has been valued,
                (though my thanks are tardy); &amp; your letter has been read or heard of by those
                who would care for its contents.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Burroughs tells me that you have been not as well as heretofore since the great
                summer heat. I trust it is only a slight &amp; temporary yielding of your health.
                You will be best able to feel yourself whether a run across the Atlantic, &amp; the
                absorbing of new life &amp; scenery in England &amp; Ireland, would not be 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01492.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01492.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01492.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                just the tonic you require. We at all events are interested in believing this, &amp; 
                think that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> are just the communicator of vitality &amp; 
                joy that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">we</span> require. I mean by this, besides its more direct 
                personal meaning, that such influences as yours are precisely what our poetry in its
                latent developments needs to make it sane &amp; masculine. And I have not a doubt that 
                your personal presence in England would do much towards bringing the time when the 
                recognition of your power &amp; soundness in art &amp; literature must become general.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have written to Mr Burroughs anything about myself that I thought would interest him, 
                &amp; I will not write the same again to you. also I have sent him two or three things 
                I have written, &amp; if he thinks you would care to see them he will give them to you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I will write to you again before long. I hope you will continue to let me see or hear of 
                such things of yours as otherwise I might miss. "The Mystic Trumpeter" 
                I was very glad to have seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But chiefly I hope to hear that you are coming, &amp; coming to us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My address is as before 
                50, Wellington Road, 
                Dublin.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This has been a year of comparative loss to me as regards physical health, but I am well 
                again now; &amp; in other respects it has been a year of gain &amp; progress. But I don't 
                find in the least find that, with progress, I slip aside or away from your poems.</p>

                <span class="tei_salute">I am, dear Mr Whitman</span>
