                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>      
            <p class="tei_p">I can hardly understand how I have left your most welcome letter so long unanswered.
                In Paris two months ago I saw one morning in a newspaper that "The American Poet,
                Walt Whitman would shortly visit England", &amp; there &amp; then I sat down &amp;
                wrote part of a letter to you, but the weariness of illness (I was ailing a good
                deal) caused it to remain unended &amp; unsent. Now I have just heard from Mr.
                Burroughs<a href="#n0129" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0129">1</a> that there is, or may be, a fair chance of your coming 
                to us, &amp; of your giving readings from your poems. As far as my own opinion goes, 
                I would say that there is a certainty of success, a sufficient success at the least, 
                &amp; perhaps a complete one, in Dublin. Do come. You do not know how welcome you 
                would be to many of us. I need not say 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01492.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01492.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01492.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01492.002_large.jpg</span> 
                that if you would come to our house in Dublin my wife &amp; I would be made abundantly 
                happy, &amp; would remember 1872 as a year good to think of.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There are several things for which I owe you thanks—two copies of "Democratic
                Vistas"<a href="#n4122" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4122">2</a> &amp; newspapers from time to time. Each I assure you has been valued,
                (though my thanks are tardy); &amp; your letter has been read or heard of by those
                who would care for its contents.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Burroughs tells me that you have been not as well as heretofore since the great
                summer heat. I trust it is only a slight &amp; temporary yielding of your health.
                You will be best able to feel yourself whether a run across the Atlantic, &amp; the
                absorbing of new life &amp; scenery in England &amp; Ireland, would not be

                just the tonic you require. We at all events are interested in believing this, &amp; 
                think that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> are just the communicator of vitality &amp; 
                joy that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">we</span> require. I mean by this, besides its more direct 
                personal meaning, that such influences as yours are precisely what our poetry in its
                latent developments needs to make it sane &amp; masculine. And I have not a doubt that 
                your personal presence in England would do much towards bringing the time when the 
                recognition of your power &amp; soundness in art &amp; literature must become general.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have written to Mr Burroughs anything about myself that I thought would interest him, 
                &amp; I will not write the same again to you. also I have sent him two or three things 
                I have written, &amp; if he thinks you would care to see them he will give them to you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I will write to you again before long. I hope you will continue to let me see or hear of

                I was very glad to have seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But chiefly I hope to hear that you are coming, &amp; coming to us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My address is as before 
                50, Wellington Road, 
                Dublin.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This has been a year of comparative loss to me as regards physical health, but I am well 
                again now; &amp; in other respects it has been a year of gain &amp; progress. But I don't 
                find in the least find that, with progress, I slip aside or away from your poems.</p>

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
