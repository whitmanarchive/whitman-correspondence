        <span class="tei_salute">Dear son,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I see by your letter of the 4th that you are working as usual. I sometimes fancy I see
        you—and 14—and Mr. Shedd<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—going up or down the
        Avenue—or at the end at Georgetown—or Navy Yard—the old familiar route
        &amp; scenes—the Circle, the President's House—Willard's—7th
        street—Capitol Gate—the Hill—&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I keep pretty busy, writing, proof–reading, &amp;c. I am at the printing office several
        hours every day—I feel in capital health &amp; spirits—weigh several pounds
        heavier—but, as a small drawback, &amp; something new for me, find myself needing
        glasses every time I read or write—this has grown upon me very rapidly since &amp;
        during the hot weather, &amp; especially since I left Washington—so I read &amp; write
        as little as possible, beyond my printing matters, &amp;c—as that occupies several
        hours, &amp; tires my eyes sometimes. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">We are having splendid fall weather, both days &amp; nights. Last night I was out
        late—the scene on the river was heavenly—the sky clear, &amp; the moon shining
        her brightest—I felt almost chilly at last with the cold—&amp; so put for home.
        One of the prettiest sights now is to see the great German steamers, and other ships, as
        they lay tied up along shore, all covered with gay flags &amp; streamers—"dress ship"
        as they call it—flaunting out in the breeze, under a brilliant sky &amp; sun—all
        in honor, of course, of the victory of the German armies<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—all the spars &amp; rigging are hid with hundreds &amp; hundreds of flags—a
        big red–white–&amp; black flag capping all—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Of course you may know that the way the war<a href="#n0245" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0245">4</a> turns out suits me to death—Louis
        Napoleon fully deserves his fate—I consider him by far the meanest scoundrel (with all
        his smartness) that ever sat on a throne. I make a distinction however—I admire &amp;
        love the French, &amp; France as a nation—of all foreign nations, she has my sympathy
        first of all.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pete, I was just reading over your last letter again. Dear son, you must try to keep up a
        good heart. You say you do—but I am afraid you are feeling, (or have felt,) somewhat
        unhappy. One soon falls into the habit of getting low spirited or deprest &amp; moody—if a man allows himself, he will always find plenty to make him
        so—Every one [has] his troubles, disappointments, rebuffs, &amp;c. especially every
        young &amp; proud-spirited man who has to work for his living. But I want you to try &amp;
        put a brave face against every thing that happens—for it is not so much the little
        misfortunes of life themselves, as the way we take them &amp; brood over them, that causes
        the trouble. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">About the "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tiresome</span>,"<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> all I have to say
        is—to say nothing—only a good smacking kiss, &amp; many of them—&amp;
        taking in return many, many, many, from my dear son—good loving ones too—which
        will do more credit to his lips than growling &amp; complaining at his father. </p>

                    1870–May 1871) ended in complete Prussian victory and facilitated the
                    unification of Germany, whose previously unaffiliated states had allied with
                    Prussia. In the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening Mail</span> on October 27,
