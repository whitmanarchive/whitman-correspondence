            body has theire good feelings
            and bad ones) i have been
            writing to Jeff and speaking
                about matty makes me
                always feel so down heart<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ed</span>
            she was so good to me i cant
            never get reconciled to
            her loss never shall i find
            her kindness from daughter
            or daughter inlaw but she s
            gone poor soul i was glad
            you got a letter from Jeff
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00618.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00618.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00618.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            i wish he would write
            to me i suppose he is very
            busy with his extra work
            george too is on seems to be
            full of business mr Lane
            has empowered him to
            oversee his work at florence
                and glowcester

            want of employment if he
                dident get the brooklyn work                
                starr

                done away at easton</p>
