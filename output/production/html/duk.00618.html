                    this letter "shortly after" Martha Mitchell Whitman's death on February 19,
                    1873, which narrows the range of dates to late February or early March. Edwin
                    Haviland Miller presumably dated it March 23?, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:370). Miller's date is correct because of this letter's many
                    similarities to Walt Whitman's <a href="med.00418">March 21, 1873</a>
                    letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Louisa's letter acknowledges receiving
                    "papers" in response to a query in Walt's letter, expresses her satisfaction
                    that Walt has received a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and echoes
                    Walt's phrase "extra work" to explain her not receiving a letter from Jeff.
                    Therefore, since Walt's March 21, 1873 letter to Louisa is almost certainly the
                    one that she acknowledges as "your letter yesterday," the earliest date for this
                    letter is March 23, 1873. Since Louisa's <a href="duk.00619">March 24?,
                        1873</a> letter to Walt is dated "monday" in her own hand, it must follow
                    this one. Therefore, this letter dates to March 23, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For

                        Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see

                    associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
                    Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
                    Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
                    reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see

                    1867, was also George Washington Whitman's employer when he began inspecting
                    pipe for the Brooklyn Water Works. After departing Brooklyn in 1869, Lane
                    eventually became the City Engineer of Milwaukee. George was probably inspecting
                    pipe at the R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Florence, New Jersey, and at
                    the Gloucester Iron-Works. The Iron-Works, an enterprise founded by directors
                    formerly associated with Star's Foundry in 1864, specialized in casting pipes

                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
