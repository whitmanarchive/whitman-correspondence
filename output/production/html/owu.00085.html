                &amp; head troubles, but am much better—(Every time lets me down a peg.) I
                hear nothing from O'C[onnor] but fear the prospect is gloomy. Dr. B[ucke] is well
                &amp; busy—I was out driving to-day, 11 to 1—Nothing definite done to my
                "November Boughs"—May be out in a year—I believe Kennedy has finished
                his book—</p>
