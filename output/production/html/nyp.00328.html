      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I write mostly to send the pictures—you needn't hurry at all about returning them—not that I have any thing special to write about. It has not been well with me now 
        for some ten days—not even as well as usual—Still I am up &amp; around every day. 
        I suffer much with my head, &amp; locomotion is more clumsy &amp; paralyzed even than usual—But my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">inward feeling</span> &amp; faith are not seriously demoralized yet. We are having it warm 
        &amp; bright &amp; spring like here at present—very attractive out, but my head prevents me 
        going out with any good enjoyment of it. My nieces are well—the one with the hair a 
        la Chinois is California, (Jessie,) the younger—the other is Mannahatta—Jeff is still at St. Louis, full of work—both my brothers have plenty of noble, manly work, 
        &amp; very remunerative. I have just heard from John Burroughs—he is full of house—</p>
