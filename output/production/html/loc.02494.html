            <p class="tei_p">This afternoon I recd. your kind p.c. of June 23rd &amp; thank you for it with all my heart. 
                I at once sent it on to Wallace.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very pleased to note that at the time of writing you were "keeping tolerably fairly" 
                &amp; that you were "free from marked pain or bother."—from which I conclude 
                that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">on the whole</span> you are

                maintaining the slight improvement which the last few weeks have brought you. 
                For this "small mercy" we are very grateful, but we wd like to hear of your
                getting out-of-doors again, without any return of the old unpleasant sensations.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Glad to hear, too, that H.L.T. &amp; Warry 
                are "well &amp; flourishing." Please give them &amp; Mrs Davis 
                my kindest regards.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">So Dr Bucke leaves on July 8th by the "Britannic"—a really

                the "British Prince," when I was going to America &amp; we had a good look at her.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Doctor will probably arrive in Liverpool about July 15th or 16th &amp; as Bolton 
                is only 30 miles from Liverpool we shall expect to see him soon after his arrival &amp;
                he will make my house his home during his stay amongst us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Wallace called here last night, during my absence from town on business, &amp; left one 
                of the "Good Byes" &amp; two of the portraits for me. One of the
                latter ("The Laughing Philosopher") appears in my photograph of the interior of

            <p class="tei_p">We walked through beautiful Rivington to the secluded spot—christened by J.W.W. "Anderton

                The only thing now awaiting is his consent &amp; that I regret to say we have not yet got. 
                We are sure that the trip would do him a great deal of good &amp; we know that he longs
                to see you but I think he is rather afraid of the excitement
                But we must wait a little &amp; try him again before we give up the idea.
                Perhaps a word from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> would help us.</p>
