                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    was Whitman's attempt to "celebrate in my own way, the modern engineering masterpieces
                    . . . the great modern material practical energy &amp; works," including
                    the completion of the Suez Canal (1869), the Union and Central Pacific transcontinental

                    submitted the poem to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Overland Monthly</span> on <a href="loc.01691">April 4, 1870</a>, it was rejected on <a href="loc.02301">April 13, 1870</a>, for being "too long and too

                    poem to an English journal. John Burroughs observed in the second edition of his
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person</span> (1871),
                    123: "The manuscript of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Passage to India</span> was refused by
                    the monthly magazines successively in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and
                    London." The poem was eventually included in the final three editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, published in 1871, 1881, and 1891.

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    traveled a great deal due to his job as a bank examiner. He wrote effusively to

                    after he had visited St. Paul's: "I saw for the first time what power
                    &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I felt for a moment
                    what great genius was in this field.…I had to leave there &amp; sit
                    down.…My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these
                    things all at once…It is like the grandest organ music put into form."
