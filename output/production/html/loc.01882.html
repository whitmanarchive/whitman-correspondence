            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was extremely obliged to you for the present of your photograph &amp; books; the 
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  of poems
                containing (what I now read for the first time in that shape) the important section of 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Passage to India</span>, &amp; 
                many modifications here &amp; there in other compositions. It happens that I have lately been compiling a 
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  of selections from 
                American Poets, &amp; I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">had</span> had to use your earlier editions for

                the purposes of this compilation: but I have now set those aside, &amp; used your new edition throughout—so the kind &amp; 
                welcome gift came to me at a very apposite moment. I confess to a certain reluctance to lose the old title "A Voice out of the 
                Sea" of that most splendid poem (rated by most of your English admirers, I observe, as 
                the finest of all, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">tho​ </span><span class="tei_corr">though​

                estimate): however, in this as all 
                other respects where the editions differ, I have followed your new edition. Many thanks also for the separate poem subsequently 
                received "After all, not to create only"—replete with impor<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01882.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01882.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01882.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>tant

                printer &amp; publisher. I shall hope to beg your acceptance of a copy in due course.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent on the copy of your works transmitted for "The Lady," after some little delay occasioned by my being 
                absent from England up to the end of August. She was (&amp; I think still is) in the country: but, to judge from a letter of 
                acknowledgement she wrote me, you have probably by this time heard from her direct. I know also that you have heard from Profr.

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Burroughs called hereon 5 Octr., &amp; is to dine with us
                tomorrow: I like his frank manly aspect &amp; tone, 
                &amp; need not say that you were a principal subject of conversation between us. He seems very considerably 
                impressed with the objects 
                &amp; matter of interest in London: I wish it might be my good fortune to see you here also 
                some day. 
                Rumours of your projected arrival have been rife for some
                while past, but, as I learn 
                from Burroughs, the prospect is as yet not a very definite one.</p>
