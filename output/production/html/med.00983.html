            <p class="tei_p">Oh, but we are in the midst of exciting times, now!
                Every vacant wall, despite of its "Stick no bills here," is covered with huge
                posters; and politicians have even adopted the plan of hiring boys with
                bulletin-boards, on which party announcements are pasted, to perambulate the
                streets. All the newspapers give up their columns to articles characterized by the
                various moods, potential, imperative, subjunctive and indicative—though I use those
                terms not exactly in the grammatical way. The large balls, and the back parlors of
                taverns, "teem" with political gatherings, or with secluded caucuses or committee
                meetings. O, indeed, but we <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">are</span> in the midst of exciting times!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Probably this
                excitement does not pervade any other part of the land so much as New York city.
                From what opportunities I have had for observing, there is, indeed, elsewhere, a
                remarkable apathy and lukewarmness. Here, however, the opposite currents meet: the
                results are divers dashing whirlpools. Alas, and a-lack-a-day! but the Republic is
                sure to be ruined, any how!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">How is it going? perhaps you ask. No mortal man can
                tell, or even make a truly reliable judgment. For me—I stick to my prediction of a
                month ago, that, as the most probable event, Van Buren will get this State. If he
                does, it will be one of the most remarkable triumphs ever achieved on the ground of
                an abstract principle, in our Republic! The Administration, using without scruple its
                immense scope of power against the ex-President—openly putting itself in the field
                against him; both of the old phalanxes united in an enmity toward him; no chance of
                his carrying any other State than this—and thus not the remotest probability of his
                being President; hardly a prominent, well-known leader, except a few of the faithful
                old VanBuren guard, coming out for him; and yet, I tell you again, Martin Van Buren
                is going to get the thirty-six electoral votes of New York. It is rather hazardous
                to say so—but I venture to say it.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">At danger of being somewhat trite, I cannot help
                calling the attention of your readers to the superiority of American institutions
                over those of all other governments on earth, as exhibited in the operations of an
                election for the Presidency. What in France would cause collisions certainly, and
                perhaps massacres, will here cause but a collision of opinion, and all will
                peacefully submit to the decision of the majority. Rightly viewed, indeed, these
                contests are purely contests of opinion, and not in behalf of men. Every candidate
                should, therefore, inscribe, fully and plainly upon his banner, his principal rules
                of action. Warm partisans will put forwards some excuse for the not doing of this by
                their favorite candidate; but in reality there is no fair excuse for it.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The weather
                continues warm and damp, helping forward the remarkable plenteousness of bilious
                attacks which has marked the past four months hereabout. Our "beautiful slattern" of
                a city is reveling in dirt, like a pig; the gutters are horrible. Fall lingers about
                in the appearance of the willows and the grass—those latest verdant of growing
                things.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">No gossip or news of any interest. Politics engross every body's attention;
                and so will it be till next Tuesday—after which I hope to commune again more
                frequently with your readers.</p>
