                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1867. Bucke's date is correct because the letter
                    asks about the publication of Walt Whitman's article "Democracy" in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> and discusses Louisa's anxiety about Walt's

                    (her 8th and 9th) is because the letter was sent by Walt on October 8 and
