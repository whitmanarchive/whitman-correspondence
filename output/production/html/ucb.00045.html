            <p class="tei_p"> Y'rs of 21st rec'd &amp; welcomed—the Cal[ifornia]
                papers rec'd—I am sitting here 2d story room, in big
                ratan chair with wolf–skin spread back—pretty cold spell of weather here
                but sun out today pleasant. Am getting along much in the same old way, rather a let
                down in health even f'm what it was—grip (pretty bad) bladder trouble &amp;
                (probably) catarrh of bowels—but I keep up sort o' &amp; was out yesterday
                noon a short jaunt in wheel chair—have a good oak
                fire &amp; comfortable &amp; plenty to eat (but no appetite)—Ed Stead (driver hansom) was here Aug: 20 last—havn't seen
                him since—I never heard whether you rec'd the books I sent you by express
                package directed to you care O K Lerris Hotel Butte City Montana (sent June 4 last
                from here)—when you next write tell.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Ingersoll's lecture on me here, is
                to be printed in a little book in N Y. &amp; I will send
                it to you soon as I get it—Warren Fritzinger is
                still with me—Mrs: Davis is well—Have had a
                depressed gloomy week—my brother Jeff (T J Whitman) died
                last Tuesday in St Louis, Mo: was a civil engineer—Hear often f'm Dr Bucke my Canada friend—Horace Traubel
                comes in every day—I contemplate a little 2d annex
                to L of G. &amp; am fashioning at it—am writing a little for outside (for
                order)—but pieces I volunteer (to magazines &amp;c) are quite always sent back
                rejected. I suppose you got my last I sent.
