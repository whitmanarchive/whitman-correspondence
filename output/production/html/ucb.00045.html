                    1884 graduate of the University of California, who wrote poetry and visited
                    Whitman on May 13, 1890, while setting out on a trip to California. Whitman
                    wrote letters to him and sent him a copy of his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems
                        &amp; Prose</span>, but there is minimal information about what his
                    "proposition" to Whitman was, and he remains something of a mystery. Whitman
                    related his impressions of Lezinsky to Horace Traubel, saying of Lezinsky, "The
                    tone of the man—his startling propositions, all confound me. As I
                    understand, he comes from California, must have money, has become possessed of
                    ideas about Walt Whitman. Today he went off to Washington, to be back again in
                    several days. Why, Horace, you have no idea of the exuberance of the man: he
                    talks of buying all my books, of buying a share in the copyrights, paying me
                    several thousand dollars, having me write no more but by consultation with him:

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
