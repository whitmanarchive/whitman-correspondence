                been well as usual for two months but am now better &amp; shall soon be ab't as of
                late years—I have moved into a little old shanty of my own—(See new
                address above)—am much more contented—am writing this impromptu at P.O.
                so you will get it at once. Will write more fully soon—best love—</p>
