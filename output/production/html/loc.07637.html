                    Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
                    (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
                    and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
                    Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical

                    informing Kennedy that he contemplated no change in his living arrangements, and
                    that the proceeds from the Cottage Fund were to be used (or not used) as he saw
                    fit. Although Whitman's friend was loath to offer any public criticism, some of
                    the contributors were evidently annoyed that no accounting was made by the poet.
                    Hamlin Garland, in 1889, asked Horace Traubel "what had become of the cottage
                    money." Whitman retorted quickly: "It is a question not again to be reopened"

                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
