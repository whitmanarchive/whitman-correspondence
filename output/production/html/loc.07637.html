            <p class="tei_p">It is a cloudy dark wet day—raining hard outside as I sit here by the
                window—am feeling pretty well—have just had my dinner, raw oysters &amp;
                a slice of boiled ham—enjoyed the meal—Get lots of invitations,
                applications &amp;c. every week—(O what lots of letters for
                autographs)—frequent visitors—sometimes an angel unawares—invites
                to swell dinners (or societies &amp;c) invariably declined—Am idle &amp;
                monotonous enough in my weeks &amp; life here—but upon the whole am mighty
                thankful it is no worse—my buying this shanty &amp; settling down here on
                ½ or ¼ pay, &amp; getting Mrs. D[avis] to cook for me, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">might</span> have been bettered by my disposing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">some other way</span>—but I am satisfied it is all as well as it
                is—&amp; whatever happens.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Morse is still out in Indiana with a probability of remaining—at least
                of not coming back here—I have not heard any thing definite of O'C[onnor]—I still jog away the
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> bits—I enclose Mary Costelloe's letter
                just rec'd—Isn't it cheery?</p>
