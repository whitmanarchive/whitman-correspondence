            <p class="tei_p">The "After All" parcel came to hand last evening to my
                great relief for I had almost given it up and had written to Washington about it. I
                see it was returned to you for more stamps. Thank you very much for the new (1886)
                    portrait, I like it very much &amp; thanks too for
                the facsimile letter with English list of contributors.
                I have the Centenial ed. both of L of G. &amp; 2 Riv. (sent on last order) but
                nothing further so far. You know I asked you also for L. of G. author's Ed.
                1882—also current Ed. of L. of G. &amp; specimen days, also for any thing you might have and be willing to part with earlier than 1870—</p>
<p class="tei_p">            By the way I want, both '71 and '72 L of G. but I do not think you have them. I have sent
               to McKay for some portraits for Harry Forman and myself
                and have told McKay when he has them collected to send them over to you to be signed
                and dated. I hope you will kindly do this for me. Is the new portrait for "Autumn
                Boughs"? and are you thinking of bringing that book out soon. I hope so. Do not forget that you are to be ready to
                move in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">May</span> bag &amp; baggage &amp; make your calculations
                accordingly. Mercury fell to zero here this morning, a lovely bright
                morning—good sleighing here now. Remember me very kindly to Mrs Stafford &amp;
                all the family when you see them—Has Harry had his neck attended to yet?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Please send on the book as soon as convenient.</p>
