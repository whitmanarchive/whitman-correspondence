                great relief for I had almost given it up and had written to Washington about it. I
                see it was returned to you for more stamps. Thank you very much for the new (1886)
                    portrait,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I like it very much &amp; thanks too for
                the facsimile letter with English list of contributors.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
                I have the Centenial ed. both of L of G. &amp; 2 Riv. (sent on last order) but
                nothing further so far. You know I asked you also for L. of G. author's Ed.
                1882—also current Ed. of L. of G. &amp; specimen days, also for any thing you might have and be willing to part with earlier than 1870—</p>
<p class="tei_p">            By the way I want, both '71 and '72 L of G. but I do not think you have them. I have sent
               to McKay<a href="#n4983" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4983">4</a> for some portraits for Harry Forman<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> and myself
                and have told McKay when he has them collected to send them over to you to be signed
                and dated. I hope you will kindly do this for me. Is the new portrait for "Autumn
                Boughs"? and are you thinking of bringing that book out soon.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> I hope so. Do not forget that you are to be ready to
                move in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">May</span> bag &amp; baggage &amp; make your calculations
                accordingly. Mercury fell to zero here this morning, a lovely bright
                morning—good sleighing here now. Remember me very kindly to Mrs Stafford &amp;
                all the family when you see them—Has Harry had his neck attended to yet?<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a></p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
