            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 29th Dec. with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the present</span> came safe to-day—Believe me I feel the gift, &amp; it comes just right too—John, please forward the enclosed slip to unknown friend—</p>
 
            <p class="tei_p">The above is a fair picture of the great Mississippi Bridge, East St Louis, where I have loafed many hours—only it sets up <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">much higher</span> than the print gives—I dont believe there can be a grander thing of the kind on earth—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I leave here Sunday morning at 8, on my return east, &amp; shall be due in Philadelphia Monday evening, before 8—The last two or three weeks I have been well, for me, &amp; am so now—</p>
