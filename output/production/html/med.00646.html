            <p class="tei_p">I have just concluded a contract with J. R. Osgood and Co of Boston for the publishing
                of my poems complete in one volume, under the title of "Walt Whitman's Poems" (the
                old name of "Leaves of Grass" running through the same as ever)—to be either a
                $2. book or a $2.50 one—if the former, I to have 25 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="cents​ ">cts</span>​  royalty, if the latter, 30 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="cents​ ">cts</span>​ )—The proposition for publication came from them. The bulk of the
                pieces will be the same as hitherto—only I shall secure now the
                consecutiveness and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ensemble</span> I am always thinking
                of—Book will probably be out before winter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new otherwise—you must have kept posted about my Boston jaunt, for
                I sent you papers—it was altogether a curious success—not so much in
                quantity as quality—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last January, I think it was, I took a bad chill—bothered me for over two
                months, lingering along—but I believe the Boston jaunt drove the last of it
                away....</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My forthcoming summer movements are not exactly decided—probably go on to
                Boston for two or three weeks, as I like to keep a sharp eye on my proofs and
                typography—then I must go a month in Canada—I will keep you posted, and
                will try to pay you a visit, too—how is 'Sula? Write soon.</p>
