            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">1) The address of K. Elster is
                
                    Mr. Kristian Elster
                    Strandgade 38
                    Throndhjem
                    Norway
                
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">2) I wrote in the midst of March a long letter to you in a large yellow <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">enveloppe​ </span><span class="tei_corr">envelope​
        
      </span></span>;—have you received it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">3) I should be glad, if John Burroughs would send me his photography; tell him that I 
                like his book very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I received in March or April with an interval of eight days both the prayer of Columbus and 
                The redwood Tree in Harper's Magazine. 
                Of the redwood Tree I have had the greatest. It is your old great theme 
                in a simple and powerful <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">stile​ </span><span class="tei_corr">style​

                embracing the holy and original nation of the far West.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">5) I am very glad to be furnished with new materials concerning the American humor. In these waggish gasconades

                of a comical poet greater than any of the old world's in present and past. But you, your humourists of the day 
                I don't like. Mark Twain has been translated into Danish this year. He is a detestable fool.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">6) Clemens Petersen's letter has amused me very much. His force is the psychological critic, 
                the analyzing power, which he can't use in America, where the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">words</span> have too much
                to do to follow such subtle explorings. Therefore he has had to be poetical traveller; but his fancy is 
                important and he has no great sum of observation. In Sweden he never has had his foot. 
                Touching is what he speaks of "a letter from your mother". His mother, which he never shall see more,
                is the only <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">beeing​ </span><span class="tei_corr">being​
        
      </span></span> in the world, which he loves. 
                I should be glad to have the continuation of his letters.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">7) I have sent you all the criticisms on your book, slang, chatter and earnest critic—all the criticism in 
                "Dags Telegrafen" is good, but the best is Elster's. I got the number of "Aftenbladet" 
                here in Kopenhagen and sent it you for security's sake; probably it has also been sent you from Norway. It should 
                interest me to know what impression also these varie<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00007.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr.00007.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00007.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>gated
                 opinions have made on you. Particularly I long to hear, if the criticism of Elster has been completely translated 
                 to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">8) Has this translation of your book into Danish not been spoken of in the American papers?</p>
