                I don't like. Mark Twain<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> has been translated into Danish this year. He is a detestable fool.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">6) Clemens Petersen's<a href="#n0780" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0780">7</a> letter has amused me very much. His force is the psychological critic, 
                the analyzing power, which he can't use in America, where the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">words</span> have too much
                to do to follow such subtle explorings. Therefore he has had to be poetical traveller; but his fancy is 
                important and he has no great sum of observation. In Sweden he never has had his foot. 
                Touching is what he speaks of "a letter from your mother". His mother, which he never shall see more,
                is the only <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">beeing​ </span></span> in the world, which he loves. 
                I should be glad to have the continuation of his letters.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">7) I have sent you all the criticisms on your book, slang, chatter and earnest critic—all the criticism in 
                "Dags Telegrafen"<a href="#n0177" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0177">8</a> is good, but the best is Elster's. I got the number of "Aftenbladet"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">9</a> 
                here in Kopenhagen and sent it you for security's sake; probably it has also been sent you from Norway. It should

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    humorist, novelist, lecturer, and publisher. Twain is best known for authoring
                    such novels as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span> (1876), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span> (1884), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pudd'nhead Wilson</span> (1894). Twain attended Whitman's
                    New York lecture on the death of Lincoln in April 1887. He also contributed to 
                    Thomas Donaldson's fund for the purchase of a horse and buggy for Whitman (see Whitman's <a href="tex.00447">September 22, 1885</a>, letter to Herbert Gilcrist), as well as to
                    the fund to build Whitman a private cottage (see Whitman's <a href="bpl.00020">October 7, 1887</a>, letter to Sylvester Baxter). Twain
                    was reported in the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> of May 24, 1887 to have
                    said: "What we want to do is to make the splendid old soul comfortable" (Clara

                    homosexuality; accusations that Petersen was inappropriately involved with schoolchildren 
                    were never proven. Petersen remained in the U.S. until 1904, when he returned to
                    Denmark. Petersen and Norwegian poet Björnstjerne Björnson
                    (1832–1910) engaged in a long correspondence, suggesting a
                    close friendship. Rudolf Schmidt pressed Walt
