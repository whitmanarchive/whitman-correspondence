                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Well here I am back again in New York—Have had a pleasant trip down east—went down the bay there after I wrote you last—&amp; also a visit around among 
                the factories of Rhode Island. Some of them are very large—regular little towns. 
                The Spragues, two brothers,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> employ 7000 workmen in their factories alone. 
                Some of the owners are men of immense wealth. I write this early in the forenoon, 
                sitting in my room in 55th street, after breakfast. As to getting my leave extended 
                so that I might stay to vote, I have settled (as I spoke of in a former letter)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> 
                to pair off with a friend of mine here who was going to vote for Seymour, and 
                return on time. The weather is cool &amp; clear to-day. I shall probably not make 
                out much [of] a letter to you this time, Pete, as I feel rather stupid yet this 
                morning. I guess I slept too hard, or perhaps, as they say, I got up wrong end 
                foremost. But I thought I would write one more letter, for the last. I believe 
                it is about the eleventh. I hope you have enjoyed reading them as much as I 
                have writing them—for that, I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have</span> enjoyed. You too have done first rate, 
                &amp; have sent me as many as I have you, and good letters too. I am now going 
                out down town, &amp; across to Brooklyn, to spend a few hours with my mother. 
                I don't know whether I told you that my sister with her two young children 
                from St. Louis, arrived the night before I left N. Y. &amp; will stop with 
                mother this fall &amp; winter—her health is not very good.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I shall return 26th. Take care of yourself. Dear Pete, we will soon be together again.</p>
