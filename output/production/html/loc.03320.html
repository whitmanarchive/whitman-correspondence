            <p class="tei_p">Instead of coming by boat, I came by the midnight train on Friday, &amp; got here
                about 7 on Saturday morning. Since then I have been to Concord &amp; discussed the
                New Poetry. The meeting took place after all in Dr. Emerson's house, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03320.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03320.002.jpg</span> instead of his
                father's. Old Mrs. Emerson (who is 85 years old, they tell me,) &amp; Ellen
                    Emerson,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> formed part of the audience which though
                small was perhaps as remarkable as any I am ever likely to have. The discussion
                after my paper, in which Sanborn<a href="#n0915" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0915">2</a> took a main part, was full of interest, &amp; there
                was a general agreement with my position, &amp; that part based on Leaves of Grass
                in especial. Mrs. Talcott Williams<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">3</a> gave me on Thursday
                evening two pictures of your house, inside &amp; out, one shewing you seated by the window; &amp; on Sanborn's suggestion I took these to shew to the people at the lecture, who were quite delighted with the glimpse of
                you thus given.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I stayed until this morning with the Sanborns, &amp; found them endlessly kind. They
                were anxious to hear all about you. Sanborn himself may come to see you soon, when
                passing through Philadelphia. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03320.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03320.003.jpg</span> Yesterday morning he drove me round by Lincoln &amp; other
                pleasant rustic places. It was so fine that I wish you could have been with us. In
                the afternoon Dr. Emerson drove me to Walden Pond again; &amp; in the evening I met
                Channing<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> (who as you know is morbidly shy.) &amp; had a quiet talk at Sanborn's snug

                    (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
