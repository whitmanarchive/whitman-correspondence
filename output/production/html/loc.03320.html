                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Instead of coming by boat, I came by the midnight train on Friday, &amp; got here
                about 7 on Saturday morning. Since then I have been to Concord &amp; discussed the
                New Poetry. The meeting took place after all in Dr. Emerson's house, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03320.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> instead of his
                father's. Old Mrs. Emerson (who is 85 years old, they tell me,) &amp; Ellen
                    Emerson, formed part of the audience which though
                small was perhaps as remarkable as any I am ever likely to have. The discussion
                after my paper, in which Sanborn took a main part, was full of interest, &amp; there
                was a general agreement with my position, &amp; that part based on Leaves of Grass
                in especial. Mrs. Talcott Williams gave me on Thursday
                evening two pictures of your house, inside &amp; out, one shewing you seated by the window; &amp; on Sanborn's suggestion I took these to shew to the people at the lecture, who were quite delighted with the glimpse of
                you thus given.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I stayed until this morning with the Sanborns, &amp; found them endlessly kind. They
                were anxious to hear all about you. Sanborn himself may come to see you soon, when
                passing through Philadelphia. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03320.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03320.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Yesterday morning he drove me round by Lincoln &amp; other
                pleasant rustic places. It was so fine that I wish you could have been with us. In
                the afternoon Dr. Emerson drove me to Walden Pond again; &amp; in the evening I met
                Channing (who as you know is morbidly shy.) &amp; had a quiet talk at Sanborn's snug
                fireside, with its blazing logs to make good cheer.</p>
