               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd this morning your additional contribution of $5 for the wounded &amp; sick. The same am't from you was also duly &amp; thankfully received last month. It is some time since I have written you.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> I have lately been down to front a second time through the field hospitals—they are breaking them up &amp; sending the bad cases up here. I suppose preparatory to some movement of course. Among the sick diarrhea &amp; rheumatism are prevalent. Many of the cases of the latter suffer fearfully. I am writing this in hospital as I am watching here to-night over a bad case.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">(Describe scene.)<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">With me here things are about the same. I have first-rate health &amp; strength. My hospital ministrations are very fascinating with all of their sadness. The wounded &amp; sick get incredibly near to one. Poor young men, they respond so affectionately to kindness &amp; magnetism.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you hear of Grant's plan to improve enormously the communication between here &amp; the southwest by rail &amp;c. so that he can transport the army by immense trains hither &amp; yon at short notice. They say he has staked all on taking Richmond within three months. God prosper him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our Virginia Army is in prime condition. This I know from personal observation. All its defeats &amp; slaughters have only hardened it, &amp; made it an army of fighters. I believe Grant realizes in his secret heart that it is the clear superior in fibre &amp; soul of his Western Army, but of course he would not say so.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, the sick are coming in here now from front pretty freely. I have need of means additional—The new sick &amp; wounded generally come in without a cent. I give aid of all kinds, sometimes little sums of money. You have been generous &amp; regular in your aid, &amp; I cannot call on you for any thing more than you are doing, but I would like you to cast around among your friends, show them this note, &amp; tell them the case—see if you could raise among them some 20 or $25 the ensuing week, if possible, for it is for a sacred object.<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">5</a>

                    rough copy of a letter to Moses Lane (see Whitman's letter from <a href="wwh.00004">January 16, 1863</a>), who, according to his letter on
                    May 27, 1863 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), had promised to send Whitman
                    $5 each month for his hospital work. March 13, 1864 is a plausible date,
                    since Jeff had enclosed $5 from Lane on March 11, 1864 (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00187_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00187_n3"><span>Although Whitman ran
                    vertical lines through the salutation and the first three sentences, they are
                    retained here because they permit reasonable conjectures as to the date and
                    recipient. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00187_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00187_n4"><span>This is, of course, a
                    direction to Whitman. Here he undoubtedly intended to include material similar
                    to that in a letter from <a href="loc.00885">May 14, 1863</a> addressed to
                    Nicholas Wyckoff or Daniel L.
                    Northrup. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00187_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00187_n5"><span>Whitman deleted the
                    following at this point: "It is wonderful to go round among them, &amp; twice
                    blessed. One wonders too where all the enormous proceeds . . ." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n100">5. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00187_n100 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00187_n100"><span>This letter is a
