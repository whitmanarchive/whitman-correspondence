                I feel a little easier f'm my long <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grip</span>—just ate my supper &amp; 
                relish'd it—was out an hour in the wheel chair this afternoon—quite 
                warm—Warren &amp; Mrs. Davis 
                well—Harry pretty well (he has sold out the grocery)—Horace 
                Traubel comes regularly—I expect Dr Bucke ab't 
                May 12—my legs even a little feebler (fell down to-day)—have many visitors, 
                invitations &amp;c (some to swell dinners) all declined with thanks &amp; respects—</p>

                in the old den, same old heavy timber'd cane seat chair, &amp; pretty much the same 
                as when you was here—</p>
