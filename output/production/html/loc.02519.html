                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
