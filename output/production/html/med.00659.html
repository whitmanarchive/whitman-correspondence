                    and reassembled. On the back of it Whitman drafted "The Sobbing of the Bells."
                    The words in brackets have been supplied from a transcription in Horace Traubel,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (New York: Mitchell
                    Kennerley, 1915), 2:136. Traubel wrote of the transcription: "W. gave me a bit
                    of his writing which proved to be a draft of his Garfield poem, The Sobbing of
                    the Bells. I found it was written on the reverse of a letter written to W. by
                    Boyle O'Reilly. Spoke of it to W. 'Yes, so I see. That must have been in the
                    eighties, while I was in Boston. Yes, we want art: I saw the Millet pictures at
                    Shaw's: it was a great day.' As W. had cut the Boyle letter and pieced it
                    together again irregularly it is now difficult to make out. Up in the corner of
                    the letter O'R. wrote: 'Shall see you at Bartlett's Thursday.' This is the
                    letter as I have got it together with perhaps a word or two not literally in
                    place." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
