            Janey mc clure that is nanc s brothers
            wife was here the other day she came
            to see if cornell had been to see me
            about the children she sends them the
            most saucy letters they think if they should
                doo any think
            she would not be any too
            good to kill her brother Edd thats the
            one in the new court house)
            i have come
            to the conclusion there is but one way
            to doo and that is to send them to the
                nursery to flatbush
            there is no instituti<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">on</span>
            in the city that they would be taken as
            they are janey thinks that is the only
            place that she couldent get them out
            i cant begin to tell and i dont want too
                half the worse that wreched woman
            does i dont know walter how you
            feel about their being taken there
            but i know that i should feel much
            better than to have them sent out begging
            it would be no disgrace as there
            is many there that is of good parentage
            there they would be clothed and fed
            if they ever can be cleaned janey says the are
            so dirty that you would not know they
            were ever <span class="unclear stricken tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_stricken tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">clean</span></p>
