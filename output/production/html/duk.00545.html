                    consistent with Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
                    Whitman living in St. Louis, with the prospect of placing the children of Nancy
                    McClure in an orphan asylum, and with the initial progress on a house that
                    George Washington Whitman was building for his mother. This letter follows
                    Louisa's <a href="duk.00544">May? 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman, in
                    which she asked him to write to James Cornwell about removing Nancy's

                        Barrus, John Burroughs (1837–1921) visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                        in Brooklyn in late June (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                        wrote on <a href="duk.00651">July 10–13, 1868</a> that John
                        Burroughs "may call upon you on his way home." If Walt Whitman informed his
                        mother in a June letter that Burroughs might visit, that letter is not
                        extant, but more than one visit by Burroughs, who traveled regularly, is
                        also reasonable.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Burroughs met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, and
                        Whitman in 1864 commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
                        Burroughs. Burroughs wrote several books involving or devoted to Whitman's
                        work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes

                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    <p class="tei_p">George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                        George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                        the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
                        Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                        Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
                        and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
                        later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
                        inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,
