            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sorry that circumstances have prevented my writing to you as I intended since my
                return home. But I have had very little leisure. Since Wednesday morning I have been
                living at Leigh—some 7 or 8 mile from Bolton—superintending some work
                which for a few days requires constant &amp; careful supervision. And I have little
                convenient opportunity for writing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter from D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J. this morning in which he tells me
                that he sent you a long account of our spree last Monday evening. I need not go over
                the same ground.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01928_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01928_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01928_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                You will understand what a pleasure it was to me to meet old friends again, so warm
                hearted &amp; loyal as they are. The Scotch proverb says truly that "there are nae
                freen's like auld freens," for old associations &amp; memories colour one's feelings
                very much.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Their welcome to me was very touching &amp; kind—&amp; like Coleridge's soup far "better than I deserved."—I read them some of my
                notes of your talk, which, (the notes) though very poor &amp; inadequate, were of course extremely
                interesting to them. And they fully appreciated not only your kind messages, but
                also your kindness to me which<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01929_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01929_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01929_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> they felt to be a compliment to the whole College.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I distributed the photos you sent to each person present &amp; the books which you
                kindly inscribed. They were very much gratified &amp; pleased, &amp; evidently felt
                your kindness very much. Altogether we had not only a pleasant &amp; happy meeting,
                but a very memorable one too.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Fred Wild was at our house on Sunday, &amp; I gave him
                his books &amp;c then. He seemed quite overcome when I gave him the "Good-Bye" with your kind inscription "from his friend the author."
                He could only say "this is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">too</span> much!" &amp; look at it
                long &amp; long. He had two or<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01930_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01930_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01930_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> three unmounted photos of himself &amp; family with him. I asked
                him to send one to you, &amp; he said he would do so.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">On Tuesday evening I called at Dearden's &amp; gave them <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">their</span> copy of "Good Bye" with your inscription. They are good simple
                hearted souls &amp; were very much pleased.—I was glad to find Henry
                Dearden looking much the same as when I left. He never
                knows day nor night of immunity from more or less of pain, but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span> patient uncomplaining &amp; kind always. His wife often reads to him
                &amp; at once said she would read "Good Bye" for him. Much of it, I know, will touch
                him deeply.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01931_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01931_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01931_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I
                called at Greenhalgh's &amp; Dixon's &amp; gave them the little presents I had
                bought—In each case my chief pleasure was in seeing the delight of the
                children. One of the first questions that Dixon's eldest little girl asked me was
                "how Walt Whitman was?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had no opportunity yet of visiting the others.—But I expect to do so in a few
                days when I have finished here.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The weather here is typical English November weather, dull, showery, with a good deal
                of moisture in the air. But yesterday<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01932_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01932_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01932_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> was a beautiful day—though of
                a different type to your clear skies &amp; drier air.—And so far we have had
                little of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fog</span> we often get this month.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think I got a little cold in coming over (though nothing to speak of). I felt stiff
                &amp; tired for 2 or 3 days after arrival. But it has pretty nearly worn off &amp; I
                am feeling distinctly better for my trip. I hope with care to gain steadily for some
                time to come.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have received a business offer today, which, if accepted, would result in my coming
                to live permanently in Leigh. I am not very willing to do so, however,<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01933_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01933_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01933_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> &amp; will
                consider it carefully before deciding.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I need not say that I think of you continually. Your solitude impressed me very
                deeply, &amp; as I think of your daily discomfort &amp; frequent pain, my heart goes
                out to you with aching sympathy.—But I remember, too, your serene cheerfulness
                &amp; acquiescence &amp; your constant kindness &amp; thought of &amp; for others. I
                doubt not that you are cheered &amp; sustained by the knowledge of the affection of
                friends, &amp; their readiness to do what they can, &amp; your faith in the
                perfection &amp; loving kindness of the scheme which provides for us all. May God
                bless you is my constant prayer.</p>
