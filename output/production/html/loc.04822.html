                You will understand what a pleasure it was to me to meet old friends again, so warm

                    the poet, Wallace traveled with the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke to

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
