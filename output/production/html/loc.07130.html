                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
                    civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
                    Louis and a nationally recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind
                    when he praised the marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to
                    India." Though their correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the
                    brothers were brought together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known
                    as Matty) in 1873 and his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death on November
                    25, 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in his obituary, "how we loved each
                    other—how many jovial good times we had!" For more on Thomas Jefferson

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1829–1914) was a specialist in nervous disorders as well as a poet and a
                    novelist. On April 18, 1878, Whitman had his second interview with Dr. Mitchell,
                    who attributed his earlier paralysis to a small rupture of a blood vessel in the
                    brain but termed Whitman's heart "normal and healthy." Whitman also noted that
                    "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bad spells</span> [Mitchell] tho't recurrences by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">habit</span> (? sort of automatic)" (Whitman's Commonplace Book,

                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Mitchell was the first physician to
                    theorize the psychosomatic nature of many of Whitman's ailments: Whitman's 1879
                    lecture on the death of Lincoln might have unconsciously brought back the
                    emotional involvements of his hospital experiences with comrades whom he had
                    come to love only to be separated from them. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
