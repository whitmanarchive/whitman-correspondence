            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It was very kind of you to send me the photographs of yourself, which I value much. I
                had previously received one, carte de visite size, from Mr. Rossetti, in which you
                wear your hat. These I like better, though I liked <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I will name some of your friends on this side of the water whom I know myself. I wish
                I could make it appear how various these natures are which have come into relation
                with you. There is my brother (a clergyman) who finds his truth halved between John
                H. Newman (of Oxford celebrity) &amp; you. There is Todhunter, (a doctor

                a man of science, &amp; a mystic,—a Quaker), he has had a wish to write on the subject of your
                poems, &amp; may perhaps accomplish it. There is O'Grady (a barrister, an ardent
                nature, much interested in social &amp; political principles), he overflows with two
                authors, Carlyle &amp; yourself. There is Cross (a clergyman, the most sterling
                piece of manhood I know) he has I daresay taken you in more thoroughly than any of
                us, in proportion to his own soundness &amp; integrity of nature. There is Tyrell
                whom I named before (a fellow of Trinity College, an excellent Greek scholar). There
                is a woman of most fine character &amp; powerful intellect, Miss West, (daughter of
                the Dean of St. Patrick's, Dublin). She, I hope, will at some time write &amp;
                publish the impression your writings have made upon her, as she is at present about
                to do in the case of Robert Browning. Then I know

                three painters in London, all men of decided genius, who care very much for all you do—Yeats, Ellis
                (who has, I believe, in M.S. some study of your poems, which at some time may come to be
                printed)—&amp; Nettleship whom Rossetti knows, &amp; who has published a book
                on R. Browning. I have been told that Nettleship at one time when "Leaves of Grass"
                was out of print &amp; scarce, parted with his last guinea or two to buy a copy.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">All I have named, (&amp; I myself may be included) are young, &amp; may, I think, be
                fairly taken to represent ideas in literature which are becoming, or which will
                become, dominant.</p>

                most absolute, &amp; the impression you make as powerful as that of any teacher or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vates</span>, you do not rob the mind of its independence, or divert it
                from its true direction,—you make no slaves, however many lovers.</p>
