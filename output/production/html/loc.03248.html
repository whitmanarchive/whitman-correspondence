            <p class="tei_p">Last spring I wrote to you informing you that the pupils of the public schools of
                this place, contemplated planting a tree and naming it in honor of you. But as I did
                not receive an answer from you, and thinking that my letter miscarried, I concluded
                to write again, and name the tree of their planting of the next "Arbor
                Day"—Oct. 18" 1889, in honor of you. I would be pleased to receive a letter
                from you giving the pupils some encouragement in this grand work of
                tree-planting—I will read it to them on "Arbor Day" which we celebrate one
                week from today—Hoping to hear from you—I am—</p>
