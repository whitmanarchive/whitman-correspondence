            <p class="tei_p">At the breakfast table this morning we all agreed—my sister most
                markedly—that your piece in the March <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> is the
                best you have written—I think so, after two
                readings. Don't you go back however on any positions (naturalistic &amp; critical)
                you have taken in former essays &amp; books—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all
                    just right &amp; needed</span>—</p>
