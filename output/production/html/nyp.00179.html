         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> have been looking for you to visit me ever since we have been in camp here but I guess you are not coming so I have concluded to write you a short note to let you know that I am in good health and good spirits. I attended the Review the other day on purpos to see you, but I failed and I now fear you are not in Washington or I think I would have seen you. I wish you would come and see me if you can, I expect to go home soon. I think our Regiment will be in Washington the later part of this week or the first of next week and then I shall try to see you. If you see Miss H[oward]<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> please tell her I am sorry she did not call at my company the evening she was at the Regt. I heard from her in a short time after she had gone, but then it was to late.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sorry that I did not see her and I hope I may have the pleasure of seeing you before I leave Washington. Hoping to hear from you soon I will close for to day, Yours Truly,</p>

                    "Hospital Book 12" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Sergeant Jesse Mullery,
                    Company K, Fifteenth New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital, on May
                    14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball in
                    lung—(ball still in probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June
                    23, 1864, he went home to Vernon, N. J., on furlough, and then served as
                    assistant cook in the army hospital in Newark. On <a href="nyp.00218">December 21, 1864</a>, Mullery proposed a visit to Brooklyn. He was still
                    at the Newark hospital on January 23, 1865. According to this letter and one of
                        <a href="nyp.00179">June 11, 1865</a>, he later was able to return to
                    active duty. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00179_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00179_n2"><span>In several letters
                    Mullery referred to the kindnesses of Miss Howard while he was in the hospital,
                    and another soldier, Charles H. Harris, on <a href="nyp.00163">May 30,
                        1864</a>, asked to be remembered to Miss Howard and her sister. Probably
                    these were the Misses Sallie and Carrie Howard listed in the 1866 Directory, or
                    Miss Garaphelia Howard—a writer, women's rights supporter, and 
                    fellow copyist with Whitman in the U.S. Army’s Quartermaster General’s Office. Garaphelia
                    Howard is mentioned in Whitman's letter to Ellen O'Connor
                    (1830–1913) of <a href="nyp.00326">February 3, 1874</a>, and discussed 
                    in Will Hansen's post "Walt and Garaphelia" for The Newberry Library Blog. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
