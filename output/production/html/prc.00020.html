            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for the copy of my poems sent by you. It has just reached me. I consider
                it a beautiful volume. The portrait, as given in it, is, however, a marked blemish.
                I was thinking, if you wish to have a portrait, you might like to own the original
                plate of 1855 which I believe I can procure, in good order, &amp; from which you can
                print a frontispice more creditable—as per impression enclosed. If so, send
                me word immediately. The price of the plate would probably be $40. gold—or
                8 pounds. It would suit just such a volume, &amp; would coincide entirely with the
                text in note &amp; preface, as they now stand. If I receive your favorable response,
                I will, if possible, procure the plate, &amp; send it to you by express—on
                receipt of which, &amp; not before, you can send me the money. (I have sent to New
                York to see if I can procure the plate, &amp; have not yet received any
                    answer.)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>

            <p class="tei_p">I will thank you to convey to Mr. Swinburne my heartiest acknowledgements for the
                copy of William Blake, (which has reached me)—&amp; for his kind &amp;
                generous mention of me in it.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>

                    when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a furor. Perhaps because
                    he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten introduced to an
                    English audience such writers as Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
                    and Bret Harte. After his death, his business was purchased by Chatto and
                    Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested
                    Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that
                    prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_prc.00020_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="prc.00020_n2"><span>Walt Whitman discussed the

                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
