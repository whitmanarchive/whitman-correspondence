            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for the copy of my poems sent by you. It has just reached me. I consider
                it a beautiful volume. The portrait, as given in it, is, however, a marked blemish.
                I was thinking, if you wish to have a portrait, you might like to own the original
                plate of 1855 which I believe I can procure, in good order, &amp; from which you can
                print a frontispice more creditable—as per impression enclosed. If so, send
                me word immediately. The price of the plate would probably be $40. gold—or
                8 pounds. It would suit just such a volume, &amp; would coincide entirely with the
                text in note &amp; preface, as they now stand. If I receive your favorable response,
                I will, if possible, procure the plate, &amp; send it to you by express—on
                receipt of which, &amp; not before, you can send me the money. (I have sent to New
                York to see if I can procure the plate, &amp; have not yet received any
                    answer.)
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I will thank you to convey to Mr. Swinburne my heartiest acknowledgements for the
                copy of William Blake, (which has reached me)—&amp; for his kind &amp;
                generous mention of me in it.
            </p>
