            <p class="tei_p">I now send you on with loving remembrances &amp; good wishes our little contribution
                to the record of your birthday—a draft for $19495 (£ 40) from Bessie &amp;
                Isabella Ford,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> William, Ethel &amp; Arthur Thompson<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; myself. I
                hope it will reach you safely—you might send a line in reply. The draft is
                payable at the Tradesman's National Bank, Phila.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Glad that you notch another birthday among us—tho' I fear the time is often
                wearisome to you. The spring comes again with the cuckoo &amp; the corncrake calling
                all day long, &amp; the grass growing thick about our feet already (very early this
                year) and the trees all in leaf—the old vigor somewhere down, the perennial
                source which even in extreme age I guess people sometimes feel within them. I trust
                you have still good friends near you, and do not feel cut off from those that are
                remote. Ernest Rhys<a href="#n4152" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4152">3</a> has just sent me some lines or verses of
                greeting to you—but perhaps he will send them on himself. I heard from
                    Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">4</a> a fortnight ago telling me he had been with you. I
                have just been weeding strawberries &amp; come in to write you these few lines.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All goes well with me. I am brown, &amp; hardy—&amp; tho' I live mostly alone I
                have more friends almost than a man ought to have. Some kind of promise keeps
                floating to us always, luring us on. With much love to you, dear Walt,</p>

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    Edward Carpenter, and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet. The Ford
                    sisters also helped form the Leeds Women's Suffrage Society. In 1875, Isabella

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
