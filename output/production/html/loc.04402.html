            <p class="tei_p">At 8.30 this morning it came round—driven by an old man named Dodge—&amp;
                we drove to West Hills. I need not tell you how interesting the country was to me; nor do I need to 
                describe it. Mr. &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Jarvis<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">5</a> were very kind &amp; 
                courteous, &amp; showed me round the house. Then to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">old</span> homestead. Apple 
                trees every where loaded heavily with fruit—apples lying in unheeded heaps on the ground. 
                So plentiful &amp; so cheap this year that it isn't worth while to send them off. And far
                more here than they know what to do with.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I went up to the old burial ground &amp; sat there alone for about half an hour. The sky was rather 
                dull—but the clouds were high, the air clear, &amp; the temperature pleasant. A light breeze 
                sounded in the woods a low pensive rhythm—a distant cricket chirped—&amp; all else
                was silent—"graves under us <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">silent</span>."<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Drove next to the top of Jaynes' Hill.—the great South Bay &amp; the beach beyond in sight to the 
                south—to the north the Channel &amp; the Connecticut Hills beyond—eastward the well wooded

            <p class="tei_p">Then back just in time for dinner @ 12.30.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At 1. 40 Dodge brought the buggy round again &amp; we drove to Cold Spring.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">9</a> 
                The sun had come out &amp; a beautiful afternoon was granted us. We didn't know where to find the Velsor 
                burial ground &amp;c., so called at Warren P. Velsor's<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">10</a> to enquire. He referred us to his cousin
                "Charlie Velsor."<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">11</a> He (WPV) knew you 50 years ago—attended your school—thought
                you boarded (while "boarding round") with his father, &amp; shared bed with him—&amp; asked me to give 
                you his best respects. He is a butcher—retains the Velsor love for horses—is a good horse doctor
                &amp; likes to keep a good horse himself—Drove on past the Harbor—up the hill through the woods, 
                past Charles H Jones',<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">12</a> along the level road, then to the left along a lane with

                him my seat in the buggy &amp; walked alongside. He attributed his lameness to the fact that his brother 
                "Lije"<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">13</a> &amp; he used to be great "hoppers," &amp; rheumatiz
                had settled in his ankle since. He is in his 78<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> year, but is wonderfully hale,
                active &amp; cute. He has a fine old face &amp; head &amp; reminded me of you in his nose &amp; ears. 
                Face shaven. He said he had been a strong man in his time, but had "got over it." He
                remembered taking you &amp; Dr. Bucke, &amp; wished that you could come again. He looked with interest &amp;
                pleasure at your portraits in L of G &amp; Dr Bucke's book<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">14</a> (As also did his

            <p class="tei_p">Down the hill amongst the trees to the secluded valley below—a turn to the left across a narrow field—&amp; we

                were at the foot of the burial hill.—Up through the bush &amp; we were in the burial ground 
                itself—surrounded by trees, secluded, still, simple, &amp; natural, with sunlit sky above. 
                Stood there about 20 minutes, looked for quite a time at your grandfather<a href="#n7515b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7515b">15</a> &amp; grandmother's<a href="#n7515" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7515">16</a> 
                graves, &amp; at the rest. ("No finer women ever walked this earth than the women of the Williams family"
                said &amp; repeated old C.V.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then back to the buggy &amp; along to the Major's homestead. Foundations of house visible &amp; cellar still
                there—had quite large cherry trees growing in cellar &amp; in centre of Sitting Room. Big Ash tree 
                (now getting old) growing near front door. No traces left of barn, wagon-house &amp;c—the grain fields
                which were there on your visit in '81 also gone—the ground now planted with trees—smallish—mostly
                cedars. The valley very beautiful &amp; peaceful in the late afternoon light.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf004r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01013_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01013_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01013_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.01013_large.jpg</span>
                I let the buggy get ahead of me, &amp; then turned up to the burial ground again to spend 5 minutes there
                alone. The ground itself shaded, the tops of the trees were bright in the sunlight, with beautiful sky
                above. The leaves rustled gently in the wind, &amp; all was peaceful &amp; sweet. I stopped at your
                grandmother's grave (—I could have loved her, &amp; even from description love her sweet
                memory—) &amp; plucked one or two small fronds of fern—(will enclose one for you.) Then walked 
                alone up the lane—the sunlight streaming through the trees—up to the house. Shook hands
                with the old man, who sent his regards to you, &amp; we drove back.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It has been a blessed day to me—a true Sabbath—in many ways &amp; will be long memorable to me.</p>
