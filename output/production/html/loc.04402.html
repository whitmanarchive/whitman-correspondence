            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am often inclined to wish that you could have been with me today. As that is impossible I wish that I could
                give you word pictures of all I have seen. But I must content myself with the briefest hints &amp; suggestions.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I arrived at Hungtington Station @ 5. 57 last night, &amp; rode in traincar
                to village, putting up @ the Suffolk Hotel where you &amp; Dr Bucke stayed 10
                years ago. After supper I explored the main street a little—called in at the Library to see if I 
                could refer to a map of roads &amp;c.—borrowed the copy of "Specimen Days" you
                presented to the Library in 1883—called on Mr Funell (druggist) to ask particulars of 
                localities—got copies of the "Long Islander" one of which I send to 
                you—&amp; arranged for

                buggy for today.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At 8.30 this morning it came round—driven by an old man named Dodge—&amp;
                we drove to West Hills. I need not tell you how interesting the country was to me; nor do I need to 
                describe it. Mr. &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Jarvis were very kind &amp; 
                courteous, &amp; showed me round the house. Then to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">old</span> homestead. Apple 
                trees every where loaded heavily with fruit—apples lying in unheeded heaps on the ground. 
                So plentiful &amp; so cheap this year that it isn't worth while to send them off. And far
                more here than they know what to do with.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Kindly received by M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Place with whom I sat a 
                little—looking in the old kitchen. Looked over the old farm lands,
                at the kitchen garden, the well, the dwelling
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01009_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01009_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01009_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                of your great grandfather (now used as a wagon-house &amp;c)—the grove of black walnuts—the
                grand old oak (shrunken of late years they say)—the orchard with its plentiful crop—&amp;c.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went up to the old burial ground &amp; sat there alone for about half an hour. The sky was rather 
                dull—but the clouds were high, the air clear, &amp; the temperature pleasant. A light breeze 
                sounded in the woods a low pensive rhythm—a distant cricket chirped—&amp; all else
                was silent—"graves under us <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">silent</span>."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Drove next to the top of Jaynes' Hill.—the great South Bay &amp; the beach beyond in sight to the 
                south—to the north the Channel &amp; the Connecticut Hills beyond—eastward the well wooded 
                undulating panorama of the Island with Dix Hills in the centre—westward woods &amp; woods beyond.</p>
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01010_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01010_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01010_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">Then back just in time for dinner @ 12.30.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At 1. 40 Dodge brought the buggy round again &amp; we drove to Cold Spring. 
                The sun had come out &amp; a beautiful afternoon was granted us. We didn't know where to find the Velsor 
                burial ground &amp;c., so called at Warren P. Velsor's to enquire. He referred us to his cousin
                "Charlie Velsor." He (WPV) knew you 50 years ago—attended your school—thought
                you boarded (while "boarding round") with his father, &amp; shared bed with him—&amp; asked me to give 
                you his best respects. He is a butcher—retains the Velsor love for horses—is a good horse doctor
                &amp; likes to keep a good horse himself—Drove on past the Harbor—up the hill through the woods, 
                past Charles H Jones', along the level road, then to the left along a lane with 
                snakefences on each side to "Charlie Velsor's. The old man came out &amp; was
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01011_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01011_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01011_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>     
                extremely kind &amp; obliging. He offered to accompany us, &amp; as he was rather lame in one ankle I gave 
                him my seat in the buggy &amp; walked alongside. He attributed his lameness to the fact that his brother 
                "Lije" &amp; he used to be great "hoppers," &amp; rheumatiz
                had settled in his ankle since. He is in his 78<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> year, but is wonderfully hale,
                active &amp; cute. He has a fine old face &amp; head &amp; reminded me of you in his nose &amp; ears. 
                Face shaven. He said he had been a strong man in his time, but had "got over it." He
                remembered taking you &amp; Dr. Bucke, &amp; wished that you could come again. He looked with interest &amp;
                pleasure at your portraits in L of G &amp; Dr Bucke's book (As also did his 
                cousin, M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Jarvis &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Place)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Down the hill amongst the trees to the secluded valley below—a turn to the left across a narrow field—&amp; we
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01012_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01012_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01012_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                were at the foot of the burial hill.—Up through the bush &amp; we were in the burial ground 
                itself—surrounded by trees, secluded, still, simple, &amp; natural, with sunlit sky above. 
                Stood there about 20 minutes, looked for quite a time at your grandfather &amp; grandmother's 
                graves, &amp; at the rest. ("No finer women ever walked this earth than the women of the Williams family"
                said &amp; repeated old C.V.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then back to the buggy &amp; along to the Major's homestead. Foundations of house visible &amp; cellar still
                there—had quite large cherry trees growing in cellar &amp; in centre of Sitting Room. Big Ash tree 
                (now getting old) growing near front door. No traces left of barn, wagon-house &amp;c—the grain fields
                which were there on your visit in '81 also gone—the ground now planted with trees—smallish—mostly
                cedars. The valley very beautiful &amp; peaceful in the late afternoon light.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01013_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01013_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01013_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                I let the buggy get ahead of me, &amp; then turned up to the burial ground again to spend 5 minutes there
                alone. The ground itself shaded, the tops of the trees were bright in the sunlight, with beautiful sky
                above. The leaves rustled gently in the wind, &amp; all was peaceful &amp; sweet. I stopped at your
                grandmother's grave (—I could have loved her, &amp; even from description love her sweet
                memory—) &amp; plucked one or two small fronds of fern—(will enclose one for you.) Then walked 
                alone up the lane—the sunlight streaming through the trees—up to the house. Shook hands
                with the old man, who sent his regards to you, &amp; we drove back.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It has been a blessed day to me—a true Sabbath—in many ways &amp; will be long memorable to me.</p>
               <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01014_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01014_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01014_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">And apart from all its old associations I can understand &amp; share your love for this beautiful country.
                I am glad to have seen it, even for a day, &amp; wish that I could explore it more fully. But its spirit 
                &amp; influence—inland &amp; on the coast—are embalmed in your book—&amp;
