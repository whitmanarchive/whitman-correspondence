            <p class="tei_p">I am down here spending a few days—Every thing
                continues very much the same—Our friends the S[tafford]s still at Glendale,
                farming &amp; store-keeping—Mr and Mrs S. &amp; all the boys &amp; girls as
                usual—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new with me—I suppose you have rec'd my pieces, slips, papers
                &amp;c. sent the past winter—I rec'd your good
                letter ab't ten days ago—trust you are yourself
                again in sound health by this time—I believe I
                wrote last ab't my being somewhat unwell—got badly
                chill'd—felt the effects two months—am now pretty well over it, &amp;
                expect to be as usual till next time—My brother &amp; sister well—J[ohn]
                B[urroughs] is reading the proofs of new book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pepacton</span> (the
                Indian name of a beautiful little river)—I am out
                in the woods a great deal—to-day mild but damp &amp; cloudy—a little
                bird they call the rain-bird is singing softly &amp; coyly on a bush over the
                road—</p>
