                    (1855–1928) was a lawyer's clerk and a member of the "Bolton College" of
                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    (1864–1954) married Horace Traubel in Whitman's Mickle Street house in
                    Camden, New Jersey, in 1891. They had one daughter, Gertrude (1892–1983),
                    and one son, Wallace (1893–1898). Anne was unimpressed with Whitman's work
                    when she first read it, but later became enraptured by what she called its
                    "pulsating, illumined life," and she joined Horace as associate editor of his
                    Whitman-inspired periodical <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Conservator</span>. Anne edited
                    a small collection of Whitman's writings, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Little Book of
                        Nature Thoughts</span> (Portland, Maine: Thomas B. Mosher, 1896). After
                    Horace's death, both Anne and Gertrude edited his manuscripts of his
                    conversations with Whitman during the final four years of the poet's life, which
                    eventually became the nine-volume <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
