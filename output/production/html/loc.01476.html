                to our beloved master &amp; representative Wallace
                on his recent visit to you, &amp; who is grateful for the kind messages of love which
                you have so frequently sent to us, I wish to send you a word to convey my deepest sympathy
                for you in your long trying &amp; painful illness. The latest

                accounts of your condition have been read at our meetings &amp; we have all been affected
                by your terrible sufferings. You are daily in our thoughts &amp; it is very pleasing to 
                know that notwithstanding your sickness thoughts of your Bolton friends are entertained
                by you &amp; that we are so dear to you that though so deadly weak you have yet striven
                to send us a word of goodwill written by your own hand. I (&amp; the others I am sure) 
                feel very grateful for the act. &amp; I return my best thanks.

                Dr. Johnston has followed out your instructions &amp; 
                had the letter facsimiled &amp;
                has kindly sent me a copy this morning with a printed extract from Traubel's letter
                relating to it &amp; you. No doubt you will get copies sent to you. It is gratifying
                to know that in your fearful sufferings you still preserve your good stout heart &amp; 
                manly affections May these continue to support &amp; cheer you. A life so well spent
                &amp; sickness so bravely borne will not be lost on the world but will be quoted to 
                this &amp; future
