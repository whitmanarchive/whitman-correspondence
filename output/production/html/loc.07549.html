            <p class="tei_p">Cold the last two days &amp; this morning a continued snow storm, quite
                brisk—well I laid in a cord of oak wood yesterday &amp; am keeping up a good
                fire—had my breakfast at 9½—three or four oysters, some Graham
                bread, a cup of coffee &amp; a bit of stew'd blackberries—(the b[read] bro't
                up yesterday by Mrs. Stafford, sent by her daughter Debby)—I am ab't the same—rather leaning to the easier
                condition of the last ten days, (with spells of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">down</span>)—tho' this is the news of this mornings paper—</p>

                for the last few days by a heavy cold. He has done little work since completing his
                last book "November Boughs."</p>

                the binders will go at it—All I have meant in it is (as I have before told
                you) to make the completed, authenticated (&amp; personal) edition of my
                utterances—a system of which L of G is the centre &amp; source—Shall of

                &amp; receive one—wh' will be better still—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have spent a couple of hours with Addington Symonds's "Greek Poets" and the Bible—full of meat to me, both of them—Have
