                All goes as well &amp; monotonously as usual (No news is good news)—I got up late, ate my breakfast (two or three broil'd oysters, a Graham 
                biscuit &amp; cup of coffee)—&amp; here I am sitting alone in the little front room,
                feeling <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not discomfortable</span> particularly—I have rec'd from Morse  a plaster 
                cast bust of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Elias Hicks</span> wh' I have set up in the corner—like it—it is a 
                little larger than life proportions—you may be sure Morse is making better work 
                than ever—I send O'C[connor]'s letter to me, just rec'd, as I 
                know you will wish to hear &amp; know—also send S Ford's letter—Also 
                send two little slips of a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> bit—you keep one &amp; send the other with
                these letters to Dr. B—(Maurice, I have rec'd y'r letter of 15th)—Have 
                quite a good many visitors—Yesterday two young women, one from Ireland—a lady from Virginia (authoress)—Mr Quigley 
                (law assistant of Col. Ingersoll)—&amp; a young Phila. littérateur &amp;c. &amp;c.—Receive many 
                invitations &amp; some queer letters—Spirits mainly good—Best love—
