                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    1884 graduate of the University of California, who wrote poetry and visited
                    Whitman on May 13, 1890, while setting out on a trip to California. Whitman
                    wrote letters to him and sent him a copy of his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems
                        &amp; Prose</span>, but there is minimal information about what his
                    "proposition" to Whitman was, and he remains something of a mystery. Whitman
                    related his impressions of Lezinsky to Horace Traubel, saying of Lezinsky, "The
                    tone of the man—his startling propositions, all confound me. As I
                    understand, he comes from California, must have money, has become possessed of
                    ideas about Walt Whitman. Today he went off to Washington, to be back again in
                    several days. Why, Horace, you have no idea of the exuberance of the man: he
                    talks of buying all my books, of buying a share in the copyrights, paying me
                    several thousand dollars, having me write no more but by consultation with him:
                    a series of surprising stipulations" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
