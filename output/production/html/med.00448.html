                    <p class="tei_p">On <a href="loc.01234">June 3, 1876</a>, Edward Carpenter ordered books
                        for Charles G. Oates. Evidently Oates himself wrote for a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span>, which Whitman sent on September 7, 1876
                        (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                        Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The
                        transcription of this note in the Stanford Library is dated "Sept 7th,
                        1881," which, in view of the entry in his Commonplace Book, is an error.
                        When the postcard was sold at the Rains Galleries on April 14, 1937, the
                        year was cited as 1876.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
