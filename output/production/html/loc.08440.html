                &amp; welcom'd all—Send you a word in hopes it may reach you thro' care of
                my friend Andrew Rome—I cannot write the name but old recollections
                (Brooklyn 1852–'61) come up on a rush—&amp; Tom Rome—how good &amp;

                remembrance &amp; love—&amp; of course show them this letter—(Tell Andrew I
                am just having a big book, complete works, including my last "Good-Bye
                my Fancy" bit, bound up, &amp; I will surely send him one)—</p>
