                than I do, but so far his diagnosis seems thorough, &amp; his doses are justified by

Heywood
                    (1829–1893), a radical reformer and an advocate of free love, was arrested
                    on October 26, 1881, because he printed "To a Common Prostitute" and "A Woman
                    Waits for Me" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Word</span> and attempted to mail the
                    journals. On <a href="yal.00298">October 27, 1882</a>, O'Connor noted a
                    newspaper report of Heywood's arrest: "I don't like Heywood's ways, and I don't
                    like the Free-Love theories at all, but he has his rights, which these devils
                    trample on" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
