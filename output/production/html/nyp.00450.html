            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for kind letter &amp; the bit poem—like a real star-twinkle. I continue sick but move slowly toward recuperation. The
                liver begins to act. It has not been an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">engorgement</span> or any
                thing like it. The basic situation I take to be this—that just now the liver
                is the seat of, &amp; concentrates, that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">markedly defective
                    enervation</span> which my paralysis of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="1873​ ">'73</span>​  to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="1877​ ">'7</span>​  &amp;c. has left me for life. The doctor comes every day—(old
                school, but receptive &amp; progressive—believes more in drugs &amp; medicines
                than I do, but so far his diagnosis seems thorough, &amp; his doses are justified by
                results)—About that Heywood, Boston, arrest, mustn't there be some
                    mistake? The Chainey affair certainly settled the U.
                S. mail part—but the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Massachusetts​ ">Mass:</span>​  statutes on printed "indecency" are sweepingly stringent I believe. Do
                you know that Rand &amp; Avery refused to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">print</span> an edition
                of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G.</span>​  for me, after the Osgood row?—afraid of indictment—Where is
