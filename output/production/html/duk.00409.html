                this is quite rudely dashed by a debilitating sickness, which her physicians
                pronounce severe jaundice, and which the utmost care to ensure her early
                recovery—We brought her bed down in our best room—She is looking much
                emaciated, but is made more comfortable by the change. She has <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">allways​ </span><span class="tei_corr">always​
