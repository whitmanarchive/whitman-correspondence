            <p class="tei_p">I have been voyaging amid the Hebrides,—strolling amid the
                Highlands,—loafing by the Sea,—trying to extract from two or three
                weeks' vacation some vigour and virtue for my work, which in these last years grows heavy. On
                returning I found your munificence to be as of old. The three volumes, and the
                photographs were most welcome. A third photograph was sent to me by Sharman.<a href="#n0556" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0556">2</a> (If you see him tell him that his accompanying letter got lost

                Adirondacks. She says:—"I have made a discovery since I have been here, and
                that is, that I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I
                fancied I enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the
                only one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
                continue beyond. The others seem more or less paltry and insufficient, except
                    Shakespeare,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> and he seems almost too courtly. But
                Walt Whitman exactly accords with the ruggedness and tenderness of the mountains,
                and seems in some way more their fellow. At any rate he so affects me, and what
                other thing can we know?"</p>

                    intended to lie on the tables of the wealthy," and quipped that "No poor man

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,
