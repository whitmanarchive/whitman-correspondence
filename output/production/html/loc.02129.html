                something of me and the work I am trying to do for you and for American literature.
                I have not written to you for the reason that you are sufficiently plagued with
                letters but now I feel that I have reached the point where I can presume on your
                interest.</p>

                In my teaching and lecturing I find no difficulty in getting Converts to the new

                papers no longer ridicule or even condemn unreservedly. An acquantaince among the
                younger literary editors of the city warrants me in saying that there is much more
                sympathy and appreciation among <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">them</span> than our friend
                Kennedy realizes. There is great gain.</p>

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
