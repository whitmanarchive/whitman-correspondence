I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> am much better now but by no means well.  The Comptroller has given me another week of grace in which time I hope to get well.

I shall <del class="tei_del tei_del_type_overstrike tei_del_status_unremarkable">leave</del> go to Benton next Saturday and stay till Wednesday.  If you could not come till Monday or Tuesday even, do so.  From N.Y. you will take the Harlem R.R. to Amenia, Dutches Co.  Benton lives about a mile from there and keeps the Leedsville P.O.  If you should write direct to Leedsville N.Y.  With much love</p>

                    (1837–1921) first met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864,
                    even though Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently
                    defended Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
                    commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
                    was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
                    men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
                    write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span>, (New York: Hurd and Houghton, 1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span> (New York:
                    American News Company, 1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (Boston:
                    Houghton, Mifflin and company, 1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting the
                        Universe</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1920). For more information on John
