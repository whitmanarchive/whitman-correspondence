            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 25th rec'd &amp; welcomed—I think I will
                send you a good photo (or two) of myself for Mrs. F[airchild]—I was aware she was a real friend of mine &amp;
                appreciater of L of G. but not aware how deep and good—you have rec'd my
                letter of yesterday I suppose—I felt dull &amp;
                under a cloud yesterday &amp; am so to-day—Morse had the model photo'd
                    yesterday—he is to take a casting from it
                forthwith—it is not a portrait in the usual sense—better I think.</p>
