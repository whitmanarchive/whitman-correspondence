         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I write in reference to a friend of mine, Dr. Charles H. Bowen, of this city, who will soon call upon you personally. He
            seeks the appointment of Surgeon to the Metropolitan Police here. I have known Dr. Bowen for several years. He was a volunteer
            U.S. Army surgeon during the war, &amp; was considered one of the best. I can fully join
            in the same testimony, as he treated, as physician or surgeon, many a case under my own
            eye, for days &amp; even months. He is a good Union man, of full professional
            experience, gentlemanly manners, temperate, in the prime of lifeâ€”&amp; I have more
            than once, when watching his treatment, called him an intuitive physician.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I most strongly recommend him as the right man, &amp; one without deficiency in any of
            the qualifications needed for the place of Police Surgeon.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Should you wish it, I will be glad to wait upon you, to testify further regarding Dr. B.
            I send you, dear sir, my friendliest respects &amp; well wishes,</p>
