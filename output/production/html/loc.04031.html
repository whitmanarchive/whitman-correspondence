                    (1851–1928) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Samuel Butler</span> (1919)
                    and the editor of many of Butler's manuscripts. Whitman evidently forgot that he
                    had promised to mail the two books. See the letters from Whitman to Jones on
                        <a href="loc.04032">June 2, 1878</a> and <a href="tex.00433">July
                        12, 1878</a>. In his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commonplace Book</span>, Whitman
                    noted that he had sent an advertising circular (Charles E. Feinberg Collection
                    of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                    D.C.). The inscription in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was dated by
                    Jones "July 1878." Both volumes are now in the Feinberg Collection. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
