                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Whitman, which may be a postscript to a letter that has yet to be located, is
                    written on the verso of an envelope addressed to Whitman. The verso of the
                    envelope that includes the note is displayed first and has been rotated for
                    easier reading of Kennedy's message. The following image is the recto of the
                    envelope, and Kennedy has written the word "over" twice, at the top and bottom
                    of the envelope. The letter is addressed: Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It
                    is postmarked: Belmont | Jul 14 | Mass; Camden, N.J. | JL | 25 | 9am |

                    Wilson was willing to publish the study. Kennedy's manuscript eventually became
                    two books, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> (1896) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of a Book for the World</span> (1926). Wilson promised
                    to return the manuscript in his letter to Kennedy of February 1, 1888. Alexander
                    Gardner (1821–1882) of Paisley, Scotland, a publisher who reissued a
                    number of books by and about Whitman, ultimately published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> in 1896 after a long and contentious
                    battle with Kennedy over editing the book. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
