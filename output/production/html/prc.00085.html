            <p class="tei_p">This is the queer little book, perhaps you may remember I spoke about some weeks
                since. It is odd in form, &amp; may be without attractiveness at first—but
                somehow I think it real <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good</span> &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">deep</span>—(after you
                break the crust &amp; get a little used to it.) My Dear friend I am so sorry to hear
                by Johnny that you are ill, &amp; suffering—I wish I could send you something,
                or do something for your relief—</p>
