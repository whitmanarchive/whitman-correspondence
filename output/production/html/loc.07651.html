                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    Channing and the niece of William D. O'Connor. In 1894 she married artist
                    Charles Walter Stetson, soon after his divorce from Channing's lifelong friend,
                    writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman. After her initial refusal to ever read
                    Whitman's work, Channing became enthralled by the poet's words and, in 1887, had
                    the idea of creating an illustrated calendar with excerpts from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. The illustrations would be made by
                    Walter Stetson. The project was never realized. For more on the calendar

                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
