        <span class="tei_salute">My dear Rudolf Schmidt,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">As you have rec'd my letter of April 25, you know that the copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Demokratisk–Fremblik</span> and of some six newspapers with
        criticisms, safely reached me here—&amp; one or two more since—&amp; now,
        yesterday, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dags Telegrafen</span>—all of
        which I treasure, &amp; am to have carefully read to me. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still unwell enough to make me remain here, quite idle, but am encouraged to still
        keep up the expectation of getting quite well—&amp; indeed am improving, though
        slowly—I enclose a piece of mine just written for Commencement Poem to a College near
        Boston city—the College is the headquarters of the Universalists—my piece is to
        be read by proxy—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I enclose you some pieces more on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American humor</span>, as you are
        interested in that subject—&amp; a very amusing &amp; 'cute letter by a lady about the
        darkeys down South—American humor, (like the old Greek, and now the best Italian,
        Spanish, French humor) is, in a sense <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the other side or opposite radiation
          of pensiveness, &amp; even mystery &amp; hypochondria</span>—I think it more
        idiosyncratic &amp; untranslatable than any I have mentioned, Greek, Italian,
        &amp;c—It is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">entirely different</span> from the English, or
          English–German—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We have been having one of our American hot–weather spells—real
        hell–blasts—here lately—four, five, six days. But I have stood them very
        well indeed. To–day as I sit here writing by the open window, there is a sufficiently cool breeze,
        &amp; it is very agreeable &amp; moderate, though just past noon. When you write mention
        whether you rec'd
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Redwood Tree</span> and also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Prayer of Columbus</span>, both sent March 4. (The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">address</span> on the last
        papers &amp; letters to me is exactly right, &amp; is sure to reach me.) I intend to send
        Kristian Elster a copy of my poems, &amp; my photograph—how shall
        I address him? John Burroughs has been to visit me here—he is settled on a little farm
        of his own on the Hudson river, 60 miles north of New York city. Your photo. sent in the
        letter of April 4 is before me as I write. </p>
