        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Nothing new or particular—I send you an "Appleton's
        Journal," with some good reading in it—Well, mother, how
        are you all? Last night was a heavy rain here—I thought of your roof—the snow
        has all disappeared here—very pleasant yesterday indeed here—to-day the whole
        city looks all washed clean—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I went to a concert Tuesday night—very good—I heard a singer, Mario, I heard 30 years ago—an old man, now—yet he sings first-rate
        yet—then Patti, a lady—&amp; others. It was in quite a fine hall here called
        Lincoln Hall—I go there once in a while—(an editor
        of a newspaper here sends me spare tickets some times—that's how I go, most of the
        time.)</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have got a letter from John Burroughs—he is at
        Middletown, N. Y.—don't expect to return here permanently to live any more—but
        will return to pack up &amp; move—his wife is still here—I was up there a couple
        of evenings since—Mrs. B. is alone—has lately been vaccinated, &amp; is not very
        well—there has been a good deal of small pox here—all the clerks in the office
        have been vaccinated—Well, mamma dear, I believe I have scribbled down all the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">small talk</span> I
        can think of to amuse you for this time—Love to you, mother dear,</p>
