                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd Jeff's letter on Monday—I am sorry to hear you suffer so much with the
                rheumatism, &amp; it is so bad in the wrist—Jeff thinks it is because you wash
                &amp; do the rough work, &amp; expose yourself too much—Mother, I would like
                if you would get some woman to come every week, or every other week, for a day,
                &amp; do the washing, &amp;c.—As to the little girls, Jeff says they <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">will</span> be
                with you, &amp; bother you sometimes too much—When one is old, one is easily
                tired and annoyed—&amp; I have long been sorry you can't have more quiet to
                yourself &amp; rest.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Every thing goes the same as usual with me—The young man that had bleeding at
                the lungs seemed to be getting along pretty well, till Saturday &amp; Sunday last,
                when he had a return of the sweating spells—they weaken him very much—I
                was down there Sunday—He has been very dissipated though only 24 years
                old—I believe I told you he is an only son.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We had a warm &amp; clear day here yesterday—after the usual long spell of
                rainy &amp; dark weather—Washington is nothing but mud—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I took tea at O'Connors last Sunday night—they are all well as usual—have got to move, the end of this month—they have found no place
                yet—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Ashton, the Assistant Attorney Gen'l, has gone on to Philadelphia with wife &amp; child,
                to spend three or four days—I like my new boarding place very well, take it
                    altogether—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am writing this at my table, by the big window I have mentioned several
                times in former letters—it is very pleasant indeed—the river looks so
                fine, &amp; the banks &amp; hills in the distance—I can sit sometimes &amp;
                look out for a long time—It is mighty lucky for me I fell in with such a good
                situation—Mother, if it was only so where I could come home oftener, &amp; see
                you &amp; all—I have not thought any thing decided of the visit I spoke
                of—I will send you word in good time, if I should come—I should rather
                stop home, this
                time,
                if I come, as I should only be for a few days, not more than a week—I can
                sleep in the room George did—or any how. O, I must tell you I am getting a new
                coat—sack-coat, dark blue—I have pants of the same—&amp; shall
                have to get a new vest—when I shall come out quite spruce—I had 6
                shirts made last July, &amp; they are good yet—So much for the clothing
                department. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Jeff don't say whether you got my last Tuesday's letter, (March 5,) with the
                envelopes, &amp;c.—but I suppose of course you did—Yesterday was such a fine day, I went off
                about 1 o'clock &amp; had quite a jaunt—went to Georgetown, &amp;c. &amp;
                walked so, I got very tired, when I arrived home—We don't have dinner till 5
                o'clock—but I always take a good lunch in my pocket—the table is
                furnished with plenty, &amp; good—Mother, I think about you a great
                deal—I think, what if mother is sick &amp; bothered, &amp; every
                thing—&amp; I feel as if I should fly—I go evenings up to the office
                frequently—I have got me a splendid astral-lamp, to burn gas by a tube, &amp;
                it works to admiration, (all at the expense of the office)—&amp; there I can
                sit, &amp; read &amp;c. as nice as you please—then I am getting many books
                for the Library (our office Library) that I have long wanted to read at my
                leisure—&amp; can get any book I want, in reason—so you see it is a
                great privilege I have here. Love to dear sister Mat, &amp; little ones, &amp; all. </p>
