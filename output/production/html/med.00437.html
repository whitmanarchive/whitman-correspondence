        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John Burroughs,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I send you a letter, &amp;c. I rec'd from Dowden, as you are alluded to. I have written to Dowden, today, &amp; sent it off—so I suppose he will send you the books alluded to. Mine have arrived—Dowden advances, expands, or rather <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">penetrates</span>—the first two Chapters of his Shakespere, which I have read thoroughly, are very fine—(I have underlined passages
        on every page) —the Victor Hugo I have not yet read —</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">. . . I am pretty strong yet, &amp; go out—but head, stomach &amp; liver, all in a bad way, &amp; seems as if nothing could bring them round. 
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Have rec'd a long &amp; good letter from Rossetti which I will show you when you come. How are you getting along? How is 'Sula? . . .
      </p>
