            to hear you was better
            of the distress in your
            head
            the carrier was
            later than usual and
            george came home
            to his dinner and said
            he saw a carrier in
            Bedford aven so i thought
            you was worse and
            the thoughts that run
            through my head in
            five minutes you wou<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ld</span>

            just then the bell rang
            and the letter man
            called out mrs Whitman
            then i thought how
            foolish i was to
            be worried before i 
            knew any thing to be
            worried about)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i have had a letter
            from Heyde he says
            han is well except
            her hand he says
            she dont give it a
            chance to get well
            she sews and works
            they have got a french

            shall change again

            write as i have requested
            her so much her
            right hand she could
            write a few lines anyhow

            walter dear i got the
            letter and money all
            safe and very acceptable

            from Jeff but it dident
            come he never had such
            difficuly in getting money
            before he is working
            now but he has tried
            all over to get a loan
            on smiths house but
                failed to get any lott
            has tried his best but
            failed) if Jeff dont
            send him the draft) he
            will have to raise it
            some how but I think
            very likely he will
            send it) O walt i
            am out of envelopes
