                    February 16, 1869. Only the day of the week, Tuesday, is in Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 18, 1869, and
                    Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:367). The subjects of the letter are consistent with February
                    1869, but Tuesday fell on February 16 in that year. The month February is
                    consistent with early 1869 because the letter discusses the recovery of Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Hannah Heyde from the amputation of her thumb in a
                    December 1868 surgery. Also, Louisa's relief at Walt Whitman's recovery from
                    "distress in [his] head" is consistent with symptoms that Walt had listed in an
                    early February letter: he had described a "severe cold in my head" and "bad
                    spells, dizziness" (see his <a href="nyp.00289">February 2–8,
                        1869</a> letter to Louisa). Those descriptions of symptoms are from the
                    portion of Walt's letter dated February 2, but the letter does not indicate a
                    full recovery. Louisa's letter can date no earlier than February 9, and Walt's
                    recovery was only partial by the weekend. According to the portion of that
                    letter written on February 6 (Saturday), he had some relief from "bad spells"
                    but no relief from "cold in the head." Therefore, Louisa probably responded to a
                    later non-extant letter. February 16 is the earliest possible Tuesday on which
                    Louisa could have responded to Walt's reported recovery. Louisa also wrote that
                    George Washington Whitman had not received a bank draft and had "parted with
                    nearly all he had." George's departure must have been recent because Louisa has
                    not heard recently from him in her <a href="duk.00637">February 18,
                        1869</a> letter to Walt, which implies that George, who had been gone for
                    several days, had not written. This letter very likely followed Walt's <a href="nyp.00289">February 2–8, 1869</a> letter to Louisa and
                    preceded Louisa's <a href="duk.00637">February 18, 1869</a> letter to
                    Walt. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00639_n9 note" id="duk.00639_n9"><span>Earlier in the month, Walt
                    Whitman reported a "severe cold in my head" and "bad spells, dizziness" (see his

                    portion of that letter written February 6 (Saturday), so Walt's full recovery
                    probably dates to a later (non-extant) letter that Edwin Haviland Miller dated
                    February 15, 1869 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    a landscape painter. See Charles Heyde's December 1868 letter for the surgical
                    amputation of Hannah's thumb (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
