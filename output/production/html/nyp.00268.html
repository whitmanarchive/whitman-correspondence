                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter, &amp; the two accompanying, came safe. I saw F. P. Church again
                yesterday—the arrangement is, that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span> is to make
                an article of fifteen or sixteen pages, &amp; is [to] be the leading article of the
                December number—it must be in his hands by the 25th of October. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ethiopia Commenting</span><a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> has been formally
                accepted, but is held back until the long article appears. I have felt that the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> folks have received &amp; treated me with welcome
                warmth &amp; respect. F. P. Church is a sample of a New Yorker, a club man, (he
                pressingly invited me to a dinner at Atheneum Club—I declined,) young,
                cordial, refined, &amp;c. He made no very decided impression on me, however—we
                will see how the acquaintance works &amp; holds out in the future. The indirect
                &amp; inferential of his tone &amp; words in speaking to me would have satisfied
                your highest requirements—they evidently meant that in his opinion I was, or
                was soon to be, "one of the great powers."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new among my folks, or domestic matters. I have been purchasing property, or
                rather becoming responsible for the same<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William, you needn't send any more of my letters to me here, after you receive
                this—keep them for me. I shall return within three or four days—I shall
                write out &amp; finish <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span> there, as my leave extends
                two weeks yet. I suppose you rec'd the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gazette</span>, containing T.
                    Titcomb,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> his opinion on such books as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                    Grass</span>, etc.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think it very likely I shall return on Monday 30th. I have seen Fred. Gray,
                Nathaniel Bloom<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a>—the dear, good, affectionate young men—more kind, more
                affectionate than ever.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William, I do hope, it will come to you to buckle-to, &amp; write something for
                    Putnam—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">et al</span>. You are talked about, &amp; cause
                expectancies, curiosities, &amp;c.—F. P. Church sent a florid &amp; evidently
                genuine message to you by me—the meat of it is, a fervid appreciation of your
                literary genius, &amp; a special request that you write for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">6</a> John Burroughs, I
                send you my love, &amp; will soon be with you all again—</p>
