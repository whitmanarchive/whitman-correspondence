            <p class="tei_p">Your note / enclosing 2 dollars to Han—directly rec'd. She is
                better, and resolute, but very attenuated—Dr has sent her a tonic (iron too much) 
                she went to the corner and chatted with an old neighbour this morning—had a dinner 
                of beefsteak—potates—cooks for herself——talks of you—when 
                she shall write to you, to thank you for all years of tribute to her—mitigating pain, 
                Would like to live near to you—could walk well enough to come to you—hard 
                world this Walt. Who cares! Nobody—not one—</p>
