                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    letter to Bucke of <a href="loc.08047">May 14, 1891</a>, the poet writes
                    that Horace Traubel has also just sent Bucke "a full set (66p) '<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Good-Bye</span>' annex." <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My
                        Fancy</span> (1891) was Whitman's last miscellany, and it included both poetry
                    and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and death, among other
                    topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as "Good-Bye my Fancy
