                A teacher explains to his pupils the meaning of a phenomenon. An apple

                    Norwegian poet, dramatist, and novelist, was co-editor of Rudolf Schmidt's
                    journal. In his <a href="syr.00004">January 5, 1872</a>, letter, Rudolf Schmidt observed: "Hans
                    Christian Andersen would perhaps not make you very great joy, if you did know
                    him personally. Björnson would be your man" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.18.html">Thursday, February 7, 1889</a>, 103). Schmidt later altered his opinion
                    of Björnson, writing at some length on <a href="loc.01909">February 28,
                        1874</a>: "His poetry comes from the source that is throbbing in the
                    people's own heart. He has been the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public.
                    But he is a living test of the hideous and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly
                    head among the flowers of the pantheistic poetry. You have in your 'vistas'
                    spoken proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the greatest
                    lack of the present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack of
                    Björnson at the same time! Björnson owes Denmark gratitude. He has
                    shown it in the form of deep and bloody offences, that make every honest Danish
                    heart burn with rage and indignation." </span></span> [<a href="#r0088">back</a>]</li><li id="n0780">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0780 note" id="n0780"><span>Clemens Petersen (1834–1918),
                    for ten years a critic for the Danish magazine "Fædrelandet" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fatherland</span>), left Denmark in 1869 amid police accusations of
                    homosexuality; accusations that Petersen was inappropriately involved with schoolchildren 
                    were never proven. Petersen remained in the U.S. until 1904, when he returned to
                    Denmark. Petersen and Norwegian poet Björnstjerne Björnson
                    (1832–1910) engaged in a long correspondence, suggesting a
                    close friendship. Rudolf Schmidt pressed Walt
                    Whitman for his opinion of Petersen, as in his <a href="loc.01909">February
                        28, 1874</a>, letter: "I have asked you at least two times how you did
