                for some days ago preceded by your kind letter.
                When returned to Washington, Clausen, 
                who has taken a strong and sincere attachment to you, most certainly will be willing 
                to translate the whole article verbally to you. I should be glad, if after a

                great pleasure in introducing you to the Scandinavian public and most probably in no 
                European country you would find the <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_kk">questions</span>

                for the understanding of your poetry. Your books and portraits have in the last month 
                circulated amongst the ladies of my acquaintance, for especially it is the women that 
                are your friends. Bjornson writes of your article: "Walt Whitman 
                makes me a joy as no new man in many years and in one respect the greatest I have ever 
                had. Never had I thought in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my</span> days (during <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my</span> 
                life-time) to get a spirit (or ghost, none of the expressions signify exactly our stand) 
                for my help—from America. But such and in no other shape of course it must come. 
                I thank him and thee from my full heart. I went amazed during some days and still the 
                great impressions are haunting me, as were I on the ocean looking on the driving

            <p class="tei_p">I am very curious to know how you did like Clemens Petersen. Of course 
                you did <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> like him. But if you have not found him broken by 
                sickness and bad humors you must have felt, that here is a mind with perhaps the finest 
                nerves for beauty, you ever met.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you do me a service? I should like to write an article on "American Fancy"

                the grotesque humor that is scattered with no pretension in your newspapers with the humor 
                of Luther and Shakespeare. Our own papers are some times bringing such specimens of wit and

                jokes of this sort. That is all I want. For instance: I saw in "Harpers Weekly" 
                one of your leading political men (whom as Cincinnatus 
                by the plough bringing <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">himself</span> 
                an address, the same person making (in two figures) compliments to himself. Another instance: 
                A teacher explains to his pupils the meaning of a phenomenon. An apple 
                tree is no phenomena; a cow is none. But if you were seeing a cow in an apple-tree plucking 
                apples with the tail: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that</span> would be a phenomenon!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At present you will understand my meaning! Good by.</p>
