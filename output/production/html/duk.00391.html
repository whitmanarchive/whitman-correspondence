            <p class="tei_p">Your letters etc, to your sister are received—and have been duly handed to
                her—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I peruse her mother's letters to you, and note the infirmity of the hand, I
                experience considerable indignation at a daughter, who comparatively well, and
                having ample time and convenience, so far deliberately continues to neglect her
                obligation to the same, and in fact exhibiting <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">no</span> emotion.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But it is only a matter of a time, (or pecuniary considerations <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_el">how</span> much longer I shall
                tolerate the personal indignities I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">recieve​ </span></span>.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">To state the latest: this morning (Sunday) I got up and prepared my own breakfast as
                usual (and after having went over my garden (until 10 o'clock,

                I quietly took a chair and sat down to
                enjoy a perusal of the New York Times. Han occupied another window, in her most
                negligent manner, peeping through the blinds at church goers; and because I did not
                look up at every remark and chafed some at the interrogation (which should have
                ceased) I was attacked with the usual personalities. I threw down the paper
                indignantly, and seizing my boots and coat retired to the kitchen, and shut the
                door, to escape further <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">provocation</span> and to prepare to leave the house.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">But I was pursued there, and could not escape without forcing my way; but I came out
                of the encounter with the back of my right hand so badly lacerated by her nails, that I am
                compelled to bandage it. And this is from your gentle seeming, simple seeming

            <p class="tei_p">I procured her a book from the library, last evening, for her Sunday's reading (a
                novel) and managed all for her comfort as well as I could.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">She wound up her most miserable outrageous behaviour by mean inferences toward a poor child of a girl, who now lies allmost at the point of death and whose has been declining for months—And whose

            <p class="tei_p">I sent a flower to her, the other day, of a kind she had craved when she was in

                nursed her in sickness, made every thing as agreeable and convenient as possible for
                her household work—taken half a woman's work upon myself. I have
                struggled within myself and solely. She is too mean. She is
                unjust—a liar, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">slovenly</span> at times, without a parallel, for a woman without
                children. She is for herself, and herself only.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I meet with much respect from the citizens of this place, and increasing
            encouragement—I shall exhibit my hand to a person, with whom she once
                lived. It will scarcely be credited, the persistent, vulgar and provoking meanness I
                have so long endured.</p>
