                    (1852–1923) was a portrait etcher from Hungary. He studied at the National
                    Academy of Design in New York and at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; he
                    would later establish a studio in New York. He also worked for the United States
                    Mint. Reich made the drawing of Abraham Lincoln that appeared on the tickets for
                    Whitman's Lincoln Lecture in Madison Square Theatre in New York in 1887. He
                    visited Whitman late in the poet's life and made what is believed to be the last
                    drawing of Whitman done in the poet's lifetime, dated "Feb. 3 '90." For a
