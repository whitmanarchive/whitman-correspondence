                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    threat of collapse faced by the House of Baring Brothers Bank in England, which
                    invested in both North America and Argentina. Although the bank was saved by a
                    consortium of national banks, by November 1890 the resulting financial panic
                    bankrupted Decker, Howell, &amp; Co., a brokerage firm in New York that was
                    backed by the Bank of North America. The financier J. P. Morgan persuaded a
                    consortium of New York banks to support the Bank of North America, averting the
                    failure of the financial institution. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n4273">17. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4273 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4273"><span>Jessie Maria Gurd Bucke
