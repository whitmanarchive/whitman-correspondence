            <p class="tei_p">Am sitting here quietly—(rather dully)—to-day in the little down stairs
                room—nothing at all eventful or new with me—a dark sulky day outside,
                cold yet not quite cold enough to freeze—no visitors—have had my dinner
                &amp; relished it with appetite—went over to the theatre yesterday
                afternoon—Wilson Barrett sent over a carriage for
                me &amp; I had just a good ride, &amp; liked the play "Clito"—Mrs. Davis went with me, &amp; every thing was enjoyable—I
                was <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">made much of</span> &amp; got back (thro' a snow storm) just
                before sunset—So you see I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">do</span> get around
                some—(when I am helped—not much of my own volition)—Alma, I shall
                have to draw on your good nature to accept [this thin?] gossip for a
                letter—thank you for yours, &amp; the girls' from Dresden, that came to me
                safely—</p>
