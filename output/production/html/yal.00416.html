An old person wants the most favorable conditions, 
        to get over any thing. Mother, I will come on about the 1st of next month—I am getting along favorably, they all say, but have frequent distress in my head, 
        &amp; my leg is clumsy as ever—I am writing this in the office at my desk—I send some papers to-day<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—nothing particular in them—but I think the English paper, 
        the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunderland Times</span>, good reading—Mother, write, if perfectly convenient, 
        either Friday or Saturday, as I am anxious about you—</p>

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
