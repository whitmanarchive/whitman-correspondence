      <p class="tei_p">I have just rec'd your short letter of yesterday—Mother, I feel so bad, you are not well, I don't know what to do—will not rest, and some food that suits, be good remedies? An old person wants the most favorable conditions, 
        to get over any thing. Mother, I will come on about the 1st of next month—I am getting along favorably, they all say, but have frequent distress in my head, 
        &amp; my leg is clumsy as ever—I am writing this in the office at my desk—I send some papers to-day—nothing particular in them—but I think the English paper, 
        the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunderland Times</span>, good reading—Mother, write, if perfectly convenient, 
        either Friday or Saturday, as I am anxious about you—</p>
      
      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Good bye, dearest mother, &amp; keep up a good heart—</span>
