            <p class="tei_p">I am still well, for me, &amp; having good (or at any rate not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ill</span>) times—Return'd from Kirkwood yesterday—Am there half the time—(have a room all to myself, good bed, good stove, &amp;c)—Must tell you about Herb's picture, he calls <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">September Days</span>—(name not very good, but will do)—Picture itself, in my opinion, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very good</span>, the best he has painted, such opulence, mellowness of color that would be your first feeling, &amp; would fill you as it did me—it is a very simple scene (story) only well shaded opening in the creek, with water 'way to the foreground, &amp; five or six ducks &amp; drakes—foliage meeting at top, no sky, every thing very broad, foliage in masses, all the handling easy &amp; large, yet sufficiently defined—really a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fine, original</span>, rich picture, &amp; in treatment no following of any thing Herb has done before—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Our folks are well as usual—(it is toward noon)—My sister is off to church somewhere—brother down stairs balancing his <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="accounts​ ">acct's</span>​ —I up here in my 3d story front room writing this—the Nov. wind whistling sharp, but sun shining—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The Staffords about as usual—crops &amp; every thing pretty fair this fall, with them—Mrs S keeps about, works hard, devotes all to her family &amp; friends, (woman like)—Debby &amp; her husband all right—Harry well &amp; at work at printing—I saw Arthur Peterson, they are all well—Return me Tennyson's and John Burroughs' letters—(no hurry though, only be careful of T's)—Best love—</p>
