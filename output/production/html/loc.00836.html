            <p class="tei_p">I got your letter this morning—this place &amp; the hospitals seem to have got the better of me—I do not feel so badly this forenoon—but I have bad nights &amp; bad days too, some of the spells are pretty bad—still I am up some &amp; around every day—the doctors have told me for a fortnight I must leave, that I need an entire change of air, &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think I shall come home for a short time, &amp; pretty soon—(I will try it two or three days yet, though, &amp; if I find my illness goes over, I will stay here yet awhile—all I think about is to be here if any thing should happen to George)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We dont hear any thing more of the Army than you do there in the papers—</p>
