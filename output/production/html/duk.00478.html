                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years
                    Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                    the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
                    (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
                    (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Smith and later a mason named French. George
                    initially relied on the significant sum that Louisa had husbanded for him from
                    his military pay, but this letter is near the beginning of a two-year period
                    during which George is financially overextended and begins to rely on loans from
                    brothers Walt and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. According to Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00476">March 15, 1867</a> letter to Walt,
                    Jeff agreed to lend George $200. For a review of the series of loans that
                    Walt and Jeff had made to George, see her <a href="duk.00581">June 23,

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman before Jeff's departure for St. Louis in 1867. Davis
                    took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856
                    and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He was a
                    topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned to
                    Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt

                    businessman. When Jeff departed for St. Louis in early May 1867, Mattie stayed

                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    nickname that Jessie Louisa inherited when her older sister Manahatta became

                    "California" on Jessie Louisa shortly after her birth (see his <a href="loc.00805">December 15, 1863</a> letter), and it was Walt's
                    preferred nickname for his niece. Another source for the nickname's origin may
                    be the adaptation of a slang term for money—"california it is full of
                    tents"—from an exclamation that Louisa made upon seeing soldiers gathered
