         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Your letter came to hand yesterday with the key of the trunk enclosed. In accordance
            with your request I met Peter Doyle at Milburn's after office and we proceeded to your room and made up
            the package as you directed, and Peter took it to the Adams Express office.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The contents are, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Gray suit</span>, coat, vest &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one</span> pair of pants. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Black overcoat</span>.
               <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Black felt hat</span>. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pair of Buckskin
               gloves</span>.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">You should receive them in good order to-day, as they were strongly enveloped &amp;
            plainly directed.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Let me know if you get them all right. I return the key enclosed herewith. Let me know
            how you are as often as you can. You had but one pair of gray pants, at least that was
            all there was in that trunk.</p>

                    of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
                    the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In December 1862, on
                    his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman
                    stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk in the
                    office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge helped Whitman gain employment in Hapgood's office.
