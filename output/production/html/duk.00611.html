                    12, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller
                    dated it 1869 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361; 2:367), and Randall H.
                    Waldron agreed with Miller's date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Extensive
                        Collection of Holograph Letters written to Walt Whitman by His Mother Mrs.
                        L. Whitman</span>, vol. 2, 1868–1873, note for letter 121, Trent
                    Collection, Duke University). Sherry Ceniza used the package that Louisa sent to
                    daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde to date this letter 1872 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</span> [Tuscaloosa: University of
                    Alabama Press, 1998], 10, 242, n. 1). Bucke's date is incorrect because Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman was in Brooklyn, not Camden. The year 1872 (Ceniza) is
                    plausible, but the year 1869 (Miller and Waldron) is correct, primarily because
                    this letter echoes a January 1869 letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman.
                    Waldron observed, "the letter from Mattie to which [this letter] refers was
                    written 1/7/1969" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Extensive Collection</span>,
                    vol. 2, 1868–1873, note for letter 121). This letter has many paraphrases
                    and near verbatim quotations from Mattie's January 1869 letter: on her cough, on
                    the family's living arrangement in a parlor, and on the cost of their board (see
                    Mattie Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, January 7, 1869, Randall D.
                    Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
                        Whitman</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 63–64).
                    Louisa received Mattie's letter "yesterday," and four or five days was the usual
                    time for mail from St. Louis to Brooklyn. Louisa's verbal echoes of Mattie's
                    January 7, 1869 letter are too many to be disputed. The date 1869 is further
                    affirmed by Louisa's concern that Walt Whitman will find a "better room": he was
                    dissatisfied with the residence of Mrs. Newton Benedict (see his <a href="duk.00652">August 24, 1868</a> letter to Louisa) but had returned
                    to the Benedicts in early November 1868. In addition, the brief mention of the
                    house on which George Washington Whitman is working (at 71 Portland Avenue) is
                    consistent with Louisa's late April 1869 move to that house. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Louisa's description of living arrangements in this letter is an extended
                    paraphrase with many near quotations from Mattie's letter. Mattie
                    (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt
                    Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa.
                    In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved
                    there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie
                    suffered a throat ailment that led to her death in February 1873. For more on
                    Mattie, see Waldron, 1–26. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00611_n13 note" id="duk.00611_n13"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
