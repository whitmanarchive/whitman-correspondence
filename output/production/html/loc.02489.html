                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace

                    poet's photo session at Frederick Gutekunst's Philadelphia studio in 1889. It is
                    also possible that Johnston is referring to Whitman's letter of <a href="med.00919">June 9, 1891</a>, which Whitman wrote on a letter from

                    Rivington by Cooper. In a postscript he wrote "If Traubel fancies any of them I

                    resident in Bolton, was a friend of the English physician Dr. John Johnston and
                    Wallace, and he later gained fame for his Lakeland paintings and book
                    illustrations. In 1948 Anne Traubel presented it to the Bolton Public Libraries

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
