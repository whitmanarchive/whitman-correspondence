        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Friend Abby,</span>
<span class="tei_salute">and all my friends, Helen &amp; Emmy &amp; Mr. Arnold,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I will write a line only—My paralysis still leaves me extremely feeble—&amp; with great distress in the head—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but I shall certainly recover</span>—mind just as clear as ever. I have lost my dear, dear sister Martha, in St. Louis—I appreciate your kind letter, Abby dear, and it is possible when I get better 
        it may be just the thing for me to come on a few days—but at present I can 
        hardly move ten steps without feeling sick—I am sitting here now in the 
        rocking chair in my room writing this—most of the time alone which 
        suits me best—it is paralysis of left side—Love to all—</p>
