                <span class="tei_salute"> My dear Walt Whitman </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I distributed the papers and magazines you sent me to every body around me and they
                are a source of pleasure to all. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> This is the Paradise and purgatory at once of idlers, and the doctor does all in his
                power to induce people to leave off every intellectual exercise:—to become
                stupid; as he says: "be a cabbage head". By doing so he says the health is restored
                more completely and quickly than it otherwise can be. We go to bed at 8.30 P.M. and
                rise at 6 a.m. Take a short walk: get breakfast at 7.30 a.m. Go to prayers at
                8.30—take another walk or lounge about: get water treatment from 10.30 to
                12 m. From 12 m. to 1 p.m. is "rest hour" every body is expected be as quiet as a mouse
                and hand over himself or herself to complete "rest." Dinner at 1.30 P.M. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02447_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02447_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02447_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.02447_large.jpg</span> Rest 40 minutes
                after dinner then take long walks, drives, reading or loafing until 6 o'clock when
                those who want take supper—Most people go without supper—but I am not one of
                these. After supper talk or play cards until bed time. The people who gather here
                are mostly people of small calibre and odd notions and possessing some little means of living in an
                independent way and to enable them to flit about from one Water Cure to another and
                enjoy the rather unusual sort of society which it seems to me is peculiar to Water
                Cures. Many of them are real sufferers from bodily afflictions of one kind or
                another and it is likely that their lives would become intolerable to them if the
                water cure did not offer them a means of enjoyment by creating a society—a
                cult of its kind—of kindred spirits under afflictions, each tottering under its
                little load of little
                things and small philosophy, but large in the measure of satisfaction it brings to
                its votaries. The Spirit of piety which one observes is a genuine source of comfort,
                and blesses the lives of many who but for this would be in sad distress. </p>
