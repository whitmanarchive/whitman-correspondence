                    Dear Mr. Whitman

            <p class="tei_p"> 
                I think it must have been my guardian angel that gave thee the "impalpable nudge" to write to me. Thy card has 
                come  to cheer me just at a time when I am feeling unusually low in spirits &amp; discouraged. I have been quite ill all
                summer—"over-work," "nervous prostration" &amp; the rest—&amp; in
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01390.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01390.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01390.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                spite of many weeks of tedious "absolute rest," I am worse &amp; not better, &amp; now I have to go off for I don't know
                how long to the Pyrennees, leaving my husband &amp; the two little ones in England. I start tomorrow. The one bright
                spot is that mother is going with me. But thy letter has really cheered me—it reminds me that absence is not the
                end of everything

                &amp; it sings, without the definite words, the "Song of the Open Road." My road has seemed so shut up—I am laid 
                aside in the midst of all the work I care for—fit for nothing—and oh! the horror of feeling one's
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mind</span>, as well as one's physical powers, under an eclipse. I have not been able to read 
                or study or write or do anything I cared

                But thy remembrance reminds me not to complain, &amp; thy example encourages me to keep sound in spirits—"which 
                is the main thing." Thank thee for writing.  
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                I will write from the Pyrennees in a few days—&amp; I hope I shall not be so egotistic &amp; gloomy. I am sure
                thee will have seen Alys by this time &amp; that she will have told thee all our news.
