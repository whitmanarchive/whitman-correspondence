            <p class="tei_p"> 
                I think it must have been my guardian angel that gave thee the "impalpable nudge" to write to me. Thy card has 
                come<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>  to cheer me just at a time when I am feeling unusually low in spirits &amp; discouraged. I have been quite ill all
                summer—"over-work," "nervous prostration" &amp; the rest—&amp; in
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01390.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01390.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01390.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01390.002_large.jpg</span>
                spite of many weeks of tedious "absolute rest," I am worse &amp; not better, &amp; now I have to go off for I don't know
                how long to the Pyrennees, leaving my husband<a href="#n6114" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6114">3</a> &amp; the two little ones<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> in England. I start tomorrow. The one bright
                spot is that mother<a href="#n6170" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6170">5</a> is going with me. But thy letter has really cheered me—it reminds me that absence is not the
                end of everything

                aside in the midst of all the work I care for—fit for nothing—and oh! the horror of feeling one's
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mind</span>, as well as one's physical powers, under an eclipse. I have not been able to read

                But thy remembrance reminds me not to complain, &amp; thy example encourages me to keep sound in spirits—"which
