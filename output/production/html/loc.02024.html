                    of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
                    the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In December 1862, on
                    his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman
                    stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk in the
                    office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge helped Whitman gain employment in Hapgood's office.

                    collecting 'Elias Hicks' these days." Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker
                    from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious

                    had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a
