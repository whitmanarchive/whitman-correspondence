      <p class="tei_p">I suppose you have rec'd word from Jeff that poor Mat was sinking, &amp; you might expect
        to hear of her death at any moment—that she was a very great sufferer when he wrote. I
        got his letter dated Feb. 5th yesterday—he said he was writing to you same
        time—He wrote very serious but calm—Mother, I will not write much to-day—I
        feel so bad about Mat—I am still improving—but slowly though I realize some
        improvement every day—my head is easier to-day—</p>
