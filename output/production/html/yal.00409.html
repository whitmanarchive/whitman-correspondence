                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"

                    was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
                    Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
                    daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
                    the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
