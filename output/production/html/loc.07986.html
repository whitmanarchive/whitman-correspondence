                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    publish a group of photographs of himself, but it was never issued. He often
                    discussed the project, which he considered calling "Portraits from life of Walt
                    Whitman," with Horace Traubel. See, for example, Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With

                    of these portraits from Whitman. See Johnston's letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.02485">June 10, 1891.</a> Whitman apparently sent instead some
                    of the photos he had been thinking about using in the never-realized "Portraits
                    from Life." </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
