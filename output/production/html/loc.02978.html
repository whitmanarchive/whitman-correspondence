            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was on the point of writing you when this minute 8.30 A. M. the postman just gave
                me your card. Yes, I am in the same place, the little house where we have lived
                almost 21 years &amp; paid rent enough to buy it twice over. How long I shall be here,
                or what I am to do in the future is all a problem. I am sorry to tell you that after
                all my careful economy &amp; saving, the various things into which William had put <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02978.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>money are mostly worthless, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">inventions</span>
                that are good for nothing but to swallow up good money. Then in these last years
                since this illness began in 1884 his expenses have been enormous, &amp; the bills of
                doctors, &amp;c. very heavy. He has also
                been most lavish &amp; generous to the poor &amp; needy, &amp; to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">causes</span> in which he believed, &amp; the result is almost nothing left for me.
                Mr. Kimball who knew more of all this probably than I,
                (I mean the bad investments) came to see me soon after William's death<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02978.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> to say that if things
                were as they used to be, he could make a place for me in the office &amp; take me right
                in there, but that under the Civil Service rules, even if I should pass a good
                examination, one must wait till there is a vacancy in the State to which one is
                accredited, &amp; that might be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">five</span> years! But he said that
                he would try very hard to get me into the Census bureau which is soon to be
                organized! I hoped then that I should not need it, but the revelations from<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02978.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> day to day seem to

                tell him that if I can fill any position, shall be grateful for it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But first I must go away &amp; rest. I have had no manner of rest since William had the first attack a
                year ago last January, &amp; I am really broken, &amp; these late revelations have helped to
                make me ill; <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ktl">tho'</span> I

                be helped. But I am, or have been ill, so ill as to alarm the neighbors, but not
                myself. Then, too, I am alone, since Harold Channing went home, &amp; I find that is not good for
                me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I go to New England, &amp; then in the autumn, return here, whether to break up &amp;
                vacate forever this little house, I know not. Indeed the way now looks very dark,
                but I try to trust &amp; hope &amp; confide in the loving care that always guides us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I did so plead with William, always, to try with me to buy a <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02978.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>little, little house, so that we might

            <p class="tei_p">Yes, I have from day to day, rec'd. the papers, &amp; all the many reminders of your

                India," &amp; the account of birth-day celebration, &amp;c. From day to day I wanted to
                write, but have had such discouraging &amp; disheartening work to do, &amp; so much of it, &amp;

                William has not kept his affairs in the order that he used to, his illness has told
                upon him in many ways. But I have been trying my best to put into order; but must
                soon drop all &amp; go for a time, or I shall not be able to get away. When I go, will
                send you my address, so that if you are disposed you can still keep me in mind by

                Walt, in saying that I have not written you since dear William's death. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> letter that I wrote was to you, on the very day, May
                    9<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> I have had several most <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">vivid</span> dreams of you. So distinct that all the next day I felt as if I had
                been with you; &amp; I wonder whether my "astral body" went to you, or yours came to me.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">A day or two before William passed away he awoke from a nap &amp; asked me "if Walt
                    had<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.009.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02978.009.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02978.009.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> gone?" I said
                you had not been here, but he repeated the question, &amp; then I said yes, you had
                gone.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I can't, I can't possibly believe that he is gone, I find myself looking for
                him daily,—&amp; the only time I have seen him since he departed this life was the
                day that I was so ill; &amp; he then looked perfectly well &amp; young, &amp; as he he did in
