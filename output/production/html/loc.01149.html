            <p class="tei_p"> That piece of writing of yours in the last "Critic" is to me very impressive.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> It is seldom you have fallen into such a noble &amp; lofty
                strain. As I am myself trying to write a little these days, it makes me sad. It is
                like a great ship that comes to windward of me &amp; takes the breeze out of the sail
                of my little shallop.

            <p class="tei_p"> I went down to N.Y. to hear Arnold<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a> on Emerson<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Friday night. Curtis<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a>—the
                pensive Curtis introduced the lecturer. I wonder if you have heard Curtis
                speak? Tis a pity he is not a little more robust &amp; manly. He fairly leans &amp;
                languishes on the bosom of the Graces, one after another. Arnold looked hearty &amp;
                strong &amp; spoke in a foggy, misty English voice, that left the outlining of his
                sentences pretty <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01149.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01149.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01149.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01149.003_large.jpg</span>
                obscure, but which had a certain charm after all. The lecture contained nothing new.
                The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> report you sent me, is an admirable
                summary—the pith of the whole lecture. He does not do full justice to Emerson
                as I hope to show in my essay. At least Emerson can be shorn of these things &amp;
                left a more impressive figure than Arnold leaves him. He had much to say about
                    Carlyle<a href="#n0139" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0139">5</a> too, but would not place him with the great
                writers! Because he was more than a great literary man he denied him literary
                honors. Drop me a line when you feel like it.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
                    uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
                    the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
                    without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Matthew

                    Emerson wrote a letter to Whitman, famously pronouncing him to be "at the
                    beginning of a great career." In his response, Whitman eagerly addressed the
                    Concord philosopher as "Master." Whitman published both Emerson's letter and his
                    response in the second edition of <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1856/poems/33"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span></a>.  </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01149_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01149_n2"><span>George William Curtis
