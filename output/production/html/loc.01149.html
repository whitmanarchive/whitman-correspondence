            <p class="tei_p"> That piece of writing of yours in the last "Critic" is to me very impressive. It is seldom you have fallen into such a noble &amp; lofty
                strain. As I am myself trying to write a little these days, it makes me sad. It is
                like a great ship that comes to windward of me &amp; takes the breeze out of the sail
                of my little shallop. I shall have to lay by today &amp; let the impression wear <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01149.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01149.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01149.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> off. I think you
                have hit it exactly with that word physiological. It lets in a flood of light. The
                whole essay is one to be long conned over.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p"> I went down to N.Y. to hear Arnold on Emerson Friday night. Curtis—the
                pensive Curtis introduced the lecturer. I wonder if you have heard Curtis
                speak? Tis a pity he is not a little more robust &amp; manly. He fairly leans &amp;
                languishes on the bosom of the Graces, one after another. Arnold looked hearty &amp;
                strong &amp; spoke in a foggy, misty English voice, that left the outlining of his
                sentences pretty <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01149.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01149.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01149.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                obscure, but which had a certain charm after all. The lecture contained nothing new.
                The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> report you sent me, is an admirable
                summary—the pith of the whole lecture. He does not do full justice to Emerson
                as I hope to show in my essay. At least Emerson can be shorn of these things &amp;
                left a more impressive figure than Arnold leaves him. He had much to say about
                    Carlyle too, but would not place him with the great
                writers! Because he was more than a great literary man he denied him literary
                honors. Drop me a line when you feel like it.
