            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your two Bolton friends and admirers, J. Johnston &amp; J. W.
                Wallace, again write in sending you their love and best wishes on your Birthday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are very thankful to have within our power the means of again communicating with
                you and of sending you a small token of our deep and continued reverence &amp;
                affection.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Since our last letter your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">November Boughs</span> has <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01024.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01024.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01024.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>appeared—of which
                we each immediately procured a copy. And not the least of the pleasures it gave us
                was the admirable portrait of yourself on the frontispiece. Every line of the book
                has been carefully read—most of it again &amp; again—&amp; has increased the
                heavy debt we owe you. We feel, too, in reading its closing lines that besides your
                other great services to humanity, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, too, like Elias
                Hicks, like George Fox, have "laboured", and "made
                contributions" to, and, "best of all set an incarnated example" of, life spent in
                the constant "thought of God, merged in the thoughts of<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01025.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01025.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01025.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> moral right and the immortality of
                identity."—But <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> contributions have been far
                greater, and of immeasurably wider scope than theirs, inasmuch as they go along with
                a vastly increased intellectual power and range, and are "consistent with the
                Hegelian formulas, and consistent with modern science." By these immense services in
                these our times, and especially in your contributions to the "thought of the
                immortality of identity," you have enrolled yourself for ever amongst those who, you
                justly say, are "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">dearest</span> to humanity,"—and are
                inexpressibly dear to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span>.</p>

                ardent love and gratitude of those who, like <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span>, are so
                deeply indebted to you.</p>
