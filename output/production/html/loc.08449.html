                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    returning to his home in Bolton, Lancashire, England, after spending several
                    weeks' traveling in the United States and Canada. Wallace had arrived at
                    Philadelphia on September 8, 1891 (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt

                    preceded by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had been
                    returning from two months of travel in Europe. Both Bucke and Wallace visited
                    Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days with the poet, Wallace
                    returned with Bucke to London, Ontario, Canada, where he met Bucke's family and
                    friends. Wallace's account of his time with Whitman was published—along

                    He visited Whitman in 1889 and in 1891. For an account of Arnold's 1889 visit,
                    see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>. There are at least two additional
                    accounts of this visit; "Arnold and Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Times</span> (Philadelphia, PA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00519.html">September 15, 1889</a>, and a different article, also titled "Arnold and

                    (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. Arnold also paid a surprise visit to Whitman in
                    Camden on November 2, 1891. An account of the visit was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Press</span> with the title "A Poet's Greetings to
                    a Poet." See Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    Traubel described the account of Whitman's visit with Arnold as "almost
