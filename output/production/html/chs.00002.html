                    accounts of his activities in Canada were more colorful than his personal
                    letters, usually cards, as also was his Canadian diary. Whitman was especially
                    attracted to a number of young Canadians; see his letters to Thomas Nicholson of
                        <a href="yal.00114">October 14, 1880</a>, <a href="duk.00751">December 17, 1880</a> and <a href="yal.00115">October 12, 1881</a>.
                    A young man named Norman McKenzie, a high school student in Sarnia, wrote to
                    Whitman on <a href="man.00044">June 29</a>: "Do you remember the nice sail
                    we had that night on the lake and river, I will never forget it, you, and I had
                    such a pleasant time up in the bow of the boat when I sat on your lap and asked
                    you questions about the which you wrote about in your book named Two Rivulets."
                    McKenzie wanted to visit Whitman in London, Canada, during the school vacation
                    period. The poet undoubtedly met the boy when he visited a public school in
                    Sarnia (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</span>, 8–9);
                    probably McKenzie accompanied the poet on "A Moonlight Excursion up Lake Huron"
                    (7–8). Whitman replied (lost) to the boy's letter on July 4 (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
