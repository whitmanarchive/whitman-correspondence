                    probably addressed to Samuel Livingston Breese (1794–1870), Commandant of
                    the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Breese was a naval officer who had command "of the
                    Brooklyn navy yard from 1859 to 1861" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Twentieth Century
                        Biographical Dictionary of Notable Americans</span>). Given that the addressee
                    would apparently not know Jesse personally (and is expressly not the engineer
                    but would be in a position to reinstate his employment and might be influenced
                    by the mayor), it seems likely that Breese was the recipient of this letter. A
                    number of factors point to a November 1861 composition date, most importantly:
                    Charles Kinnaird Graham was not "the late engineer" of the Navy Yard until
                    October 15, 1861 (see below); William Wall was elected to office in 1861, and
                    Humphrey left office at the same time; and finally, the decision by the Kentucky
                    legislature to remain neutral in the Civil War (the subject of the poem on the
                    recto of this manuscript) was not reached until late September 1861. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
