                    Whitman did not hurry—he never did when he was importuned—and he
                    arrived in New York on April 9. In fact, he apparently did not write to Anne
                    until March 27 (see the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of <a href="upa.00188">March 27, 1879</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00187_n9 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00187_n9"><span>Grace, Herbert's

                    position, and that she wondered about his making a career in America, but by
                        <a href="loc.04054">January 14</a>, she had come to the conclusion
                    that Percy should remain in England (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Letters of Anne
                        Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</span>, 167, 169–170). Percy's problems
                    created a great deal of uncertainly for Anne, since she had to assist her son,
                    as she wrote to Beatrice on January 28, "with a little of the money that was to
                    have taken us back—so that even if he gets an opening in England &amp;
                    decides not to come, we may have to wait another year, &amp; contrive to get a
                    little forward in money matters somehow or other before we can go" (Feinberg).
                    At this time Percy was engaged in experiments which led to the establishment of
                    the Basic Bessemer Process; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Obituary Notices of Fellows of
