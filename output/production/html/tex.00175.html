                        23, 1866. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter's mailing to May 24, 1866,
                        and Edwin Haviland Miller did not include the letter in his calendar of
                        letters (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                        New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). Bucke's date may be
                        derived from the envelope in which the letter was enclosed. The second page
                        of the letter has the note "wensday" in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand.
                        That note may date the letter's composition to May 23, 1866, which fell on
                        Wednesday in 1866.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">As the information in the letter is otherwise scant, some support for year
                        1866 is provided by eliminating the previous and subsequent years according
                        to contextual hints. The years 1864 and 1865 can be excluded because George
                        Washington Whitman's army concerns would have been present in a letter of
                        those years. The years 1867 and 1868 can be excluded also. If the former, it
                        would be unusual for Louisa not to mention Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
                        recent departure for St. Louis, which raised housing concerns for Louisa in
                        May 1867. The latter year (1868) can be eliminated based on Louisa's
                        expressed hopes for a visit from Walt Whitman. She would not have expected a
                        visit in 1868 because Walt on April 23, 1868 promised a visit to Brooklyn, a
                        visit that extended from May 4 to May 17. On the other hand, Louisa's
                        mentions of Brooklyn Water Works engineers Joseph Phineas Davis and Louis
                        Probasco and her references to the family of her deceased son Andrew Jackson
                        Whitman are consistent with the year 1866—and probably consistent with
                        a Water Works public relations disaster in early May 1866.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Works in early May 1866, commissioners witnessed outdoor toilets and drainage
                    ditches that discharged into the Ridgewood Reservoir, which supplied drinking
                    water. If Probasco lost his position, he may have been removed because of public

                    speculative as the transcription is questionable, and no external source

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
