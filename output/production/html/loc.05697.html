            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I feel as if this beautiful spring morning here in England must send you greetings
                through me. Our sunny little mound of garden, which runs down
                toward the south, is fragrant with hyacinths and wall-flowers (beautiful, tawny,
                reddish, yellow fellows laden with rich perfume)—and at the bottom is a big
                old cherry tree—one mass of snowy blossom; in a neighbour's gay garden &amp;
                beyond is a distant glimpse of some tall elms just putting on their first tender
                green: our little breakfast room where I always sit of a morning opens with glass
                doors into this garden. Herby is gone with the "Sunday Tramps,"
                of whom he is a member, for a ten or fifteen-mile walk. Said tramps are some half
                dozen friends &amp; neighbours, some of them very learned professors but genial good
                fellows withal, who agree to spend every other Sunday morning in taking one of their
                long walks together—&amp; a very good time they have. Giddy is gone to hear a lecture; our bonnie Scotch girl is roasting
                the beef for dinner, singing the while in the kitchen; and pussy &amp; I are sitting
                very companionable &amp; meditative in the little room before described.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You cannot think, dear friend, what a pleasure it was to have a whole big letter from
                you (not that I despise Postcards—they are good stop-gaps, but not the real
                thing). Yes, I have &amp; prize the article on the Hebrew Scriptures. How I wish you
                could make up your mind to spend your summer holiday with us.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still struggling along, striving to say something which, if I can say it to my
                mind, will be useful—will clear away a little of the rubbish that hides you from
                men's eyes. I hear the "Eminent Women Series" is having quite a
                large sale in America. Good-bye. Love to Mrs. Whitman. Greetings to your
                    brother. Love from us all to you.</p>
