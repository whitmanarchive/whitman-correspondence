Whitman, 51st New York, who gave you the slip you sent from Annapolis Feb. 19, with his &amp; mother's address, Feb. 14th? Why did not he, &amp; the other officers, 51st N. Y., come up with the main body, for exchange? Were the other officers 51st there at Danville, time you left? Please tell me all you know, or think probable, on this subject of why they did not come? Have they been sent further south, to avoid exchanging them, or are they still at Danville? <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Was</span> my brother <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">really well</span> &amp; hearty?

My dear sir, if you could take a leisure half hour &amp; write me, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">soon as possible</span>, what you know on these, or any points relating to my brother, it would deeply oblige me—address—</p>
