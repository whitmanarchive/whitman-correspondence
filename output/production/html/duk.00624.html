                <span class="tei_salute">My dear walt</span>
            </span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">i got your letter of sunday and
                monday and the papers
                all come to day tuesday
            i am always glad to get a letter from you walter
            dear i wish i could get one every day O walt if
            you could only say you was well once more
            i doo pray for your recovery walt and i doo
            think you will be restored to health again
            it is very tedious to be so long disabled and your
            head you speak about being so bad how does it
            feel walter dear do you have dissiness is it a
                heavy feeling
            either is bad enoughf i think any thing
            the matter with the head affects the whole system
            i wish you could have a change you have been
            so long and so much alone but i hope you dont
            get down spirited) it sometimes comes on a person
            before they are aware of it) i got very nervous
            after matty s death and have such a choaking sensation
            but i know what makes me its thinking and
            fretting but i try to not think of things any more than
            i can help) george is up to his eys in business he
            is very anxious to get all the work he can
            his house
            
            is begun the cellar is dug and the foundation
            laid he is going to build a three story brick house
            with an extention parlor and dining room and
            kitchen and shed on the first floor the man does it
            all for i beleive its 38 hundred dollars puts in a
                range in the kitchen and bath and i believe privee
            and water closet there is no fireplaces except in
            the kitchen but one chimney peice in the whole house
            that chimney peice in the parlor he is to purchase himself
            no places for stove pipes) george says he thinks he
            will lose money on it) if we ever build walt
            which i hope we shall
            i dont think it will be quite
            so extensive) the cheapest house that you could build
            would be a 2 story house with 2 rooms below and 2 rooms
            above with a shed kichen with no fireplace in the
            house except in the kichen there to have a good size
            fireplace so walter dear we can have our washing
            done) there is ways for ventilation without fereplaces
            and its much cheaper to have stove pipes than firplac<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">es</span>
            what do you think of my plan walt we couldent
            have many visitors to stay all night

            i took up her meals all day yesterday but to
            day she has come down but lays on the
            sofa) i think her aunt will live with them
            Lou says george likes to have her here
            and he does i make no doubt he make a
            great time with her folks) i liked it better before
            her aunt came they 
            want to be by themselves</p>
            <p class="tei_p">walt what did you think of Josephenes letter

            ma wants me to come to their house and
            stay a while but i shall never go of course

            dear</p>
            <p class="tei_p">there was a man here to day that had put out some trees for
            george and george left the money to pay him and i went to the
            alley to pay him as lou  was lying down and i was lame and he said
            if i would get a pint of the best whiskey and put 2 teaspoonfuls of salt
            peter in it and take a teaspoonful night and morning it would
            help me
            
            and bath with it too he said i dont know as i shall
            get it but if you think of it walter sometime when
            your doctor is there you may ask him about it i have
            heard of something simular being good for rhumatis</p>
            <p class="tei_p">we have the doctor here most every day but i dont put faith
            in him</p>
