        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Linton,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">My note of yesterday, (or day before,) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">asking for the bill</span> was
        written in the midst of a splitting headache—&amp; without fully reading yours. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">To-day, better, I have just taken up yours to read a second time, (as I generally do with
        my friends' letters,) &amp; see your kind &amp; friendly gift to me of the prints—which I accept with thanks &amp; pleasure. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Two days now of fine weather—which I fancy is telling on me, as well as on the frozen
        ground &amp; sap in the trees—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you—</span>
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman</span>
