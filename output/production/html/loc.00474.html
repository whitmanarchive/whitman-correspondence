            <p class="tei_p">Although you hear from us so seldom yet we do not forget you—I expected to get to Camden before this—but business prevented—We have had lots of political trouble here this spring and summer and the end is not yet—how it will affect me I am unable to even guess now—sometimes it looks bad and then again as if it would blow over—at any rate it cannot be long before it will decide itself one way or another—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tis a long while since we have heard from you—how are you getting along  now and then we see some little thing in the papers—the last was that you were engaged in getting up another book—I was glad to know that you were feeling well enough—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How is George and Loo. I hope well  Is George busy still on the pipe question  We are having very hot weather for the last few days—On Thursday next Hattie and Jessie depart for Iowa or Wisconsin for a month or two—Jess and Hat have grown quite up and begin to look like young ladies—they keep to school pretty close and study well—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Let me hear form you when you can—if matters change here I shall make you a visit for awhile—I should endeavor to get a job in Baltimore as I see they are getting ready to build works there—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Love to all—not forgetting Ed</p>
