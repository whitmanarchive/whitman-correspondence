                        <a href="loc.05109">May 8</a> and again on June 18. In the earlier
                    letter she objected to Whitman's rearrangement of his poems and to the new
                    titles in the 1882 edition. In the latter she praised "A Memorandum at a
                    Venture": "It is as clear as daylight to me that you speak
                    truth—invigorating ennobling truth, full of hope &amp; promise &amp;
                    impetus for the race. I have never for a moment wavered in my belief in this
                    truth since it burst upon me a veritable sunrise in reading your poems in 1869"
                    (University of Pennsylvania). On July 28 Gilchrist in a letter to Burroughs
                    offered her defense of Whitman, which she was willing to have submitted to the
                    New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman

                    1931], 220–221). The newspaper, however, declined to publish it (Barrus,
                    242). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
