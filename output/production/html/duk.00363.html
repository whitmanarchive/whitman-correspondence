                    captured on September 30, 1864, at Poplar Grove Church, Virginia. Almost the
                    entire Fifty-First New York Regiment was lost: killed (2), wounded (10), and
                    captured or missing (332). Also suffering severe losses in captured or missing
                    was the Forty-Eighth Pennsylvania Regiment (see George Whitman's letter to
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from <a href="duk.00359">August 9, 1864</a>).
                    Both regiments, along with the Thirty-Fifth and Fifty-Eighth Massachusetts
                    regiments, suffered heavy reduction in ranks when, as the first line of defense
                    in the battle near Pegram house, they were cut off from the other half of their
                    outfit—the First Brigade of the Second Division in the Ninth
                    Army—commanded by Colonel John I. Curtin. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00363_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Loving tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00363_n2"><span>John Gibson Wright rose
