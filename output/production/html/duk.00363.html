               <p class="tei_p">Here I am perfectly well and unhurt, but a prisoner. I was captured day before yesterday with Major Wright, Lieuts Pooley, Cauldwell, Ackerson, Sims, and nearly the entire Regt. that was not killed or wounded  Lieut Butler was badly wounded  I am in tip top health and Spirits, and am as tough as a mule and shall get along first rate,  Mother please dont worry and all will be right in time if you will not worry  I wish Walt, or Jeff would write to Lieut. Babcock of our Regt (who is with the Regt) and tell him to send my things home by express, as I should be very sorry to lose them.
