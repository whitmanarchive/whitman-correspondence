            <p class="tei_p">Received your card of Dec 12 at <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aja tei_unclear_cert_low">proper</span> time I see a remarkably favorable notice of your 
                friend <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Conway</span> by a female correspondent of a Nashville paper. 
                Why not tell me of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your pleasure from his visit &amp;c &amp;c</span>? 
                I have been thinking a long time about sending you some scraps of printed matter—among them some 
                written by a Dr (M.D.) F.O. Ticknor of (Columbus) Georgia. He was a poetical or at least 
                fanciful writer in both verse and prose form fully as much so in prose as in verse. He was a 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">brisk</span> or piquant and pleasing scribbler yet an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">extremist</span> 
                and decidedly a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">failure</span> as a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">philosopher</span>. He died a year
                or so ago. I have not read much of what he wrote after the beginning of the war. (After getting from you
                John Burroughs' picture, I sent him in latter part of June '75 a short note and some
                scraps of Ticknor's <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fanciful</span> writing about fruit-culture—directed to Esopus 
                New York, his letter to you being thus Esopus West Park NY found ano West Park in P.O. Directory</p>           
            <p class="tei_p">I got no notice of its receipt by him, which was quite a disappointment, as I would have been glad for him to have Ticknor's pieces.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have wanted you to see a notice in the N.Y. Weekly Sun of Dec 8 last of Joaquin

                ask you a question or more on Intellectual or Moral Philosophy. Do all writers who deny Free Will and yet 
                wish to find <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">room for blame</span>, make the same <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ridiculous blunder</span>
                that is made by <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Abercrombie</span> in his Int. Phil. 
                for Schools? he says we may blame a man to-day (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  
                not free) because in time past (when <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">feeling</span> himself free ☛ 
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  not so ☚) he did wrong repeatedly and brought
                himself to be of such a character that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right motives</span> can't have their 
                proper effect. Absurd, Absurd, &amp;c &amp;c "All is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">truth</span> without exception".</p>
            <p class="tei_p">About ten months ago a Presiding Elder of the Methodist church, after "talking around the edges" (as I called it)
                of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">great question</span> (Religion), and being much surprised and a little frightened 
                (doubtless) by the quiet strength and yet charitable tenderness of the philosopher, admitted the latter was 
                perfectly <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sane</span>, and "yet there must be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a screw loose somewhere</span>.
                Walt! do you think there is "a screw loose somewhere" in all advocates of Orthodoxy? I know there is with many, 
                and it is thus—their <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">conceit</span> enables them to hope <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">they</span> 
                will escape "the wrath to come" and with that weak <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">moral sense</span> that will "always praise
                the bridge that passes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span> over safely," they are satisfied. 
                If you encourage me to write, and say you will sometimes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">write to me</span> I will buy
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me some pens</span>—one of my curious ways I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
