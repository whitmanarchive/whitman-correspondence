                I have been thinking a long time about sending you some scraps of printed matter—among them some

                or so ago. I have not read much of what he wrote after the beginning of the war. (After getting from you

                    (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
                    rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
                    although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
                    When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01837">August 13,
                        1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
                    letter from <a href="loc.01838">September 13, 1874</a>: a former Rebel
                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
                    war he had been "a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slaveholding</span> youthful 'patriarch.'"
                    He informed Whitman in the <a href="loc.01837">August 13, 1874</a>, letter
                    that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                    Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                    that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                    Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                    profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                    after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
                    mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes with the usual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lack</span> of
                        <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">flowers</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fruit</span>." See

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    Cincinnatus Heine Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of
                    the Rockies" and "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness
                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
