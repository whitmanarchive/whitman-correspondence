                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

In 1874, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Graphic</span> printed "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00134.html">A Kiss to the Bride</a>" (May 21, 1874), "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00132.html">Song of the Universal</a>" (June 17, 1874), and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00133.html">An Old Man's Thought of School</a>" (November 3, 1874). On November 25,
                    1873, a picture of Whitman and a review of his work (excerpted by Richard
                    Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 209–210)
                    occupied an entire page of the paper (as Whitman alludes to in his <a href="loc.01624">November 28, 1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle). An
                    editorial in the same issue added biographical details, probably supplied by
                    Whitman himself, and announced the forthcoming publication of the sixth edition
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. For more on Whitman's relationship
                    with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Graphic</span>, see Susan Belasco, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00107.html">The New York Daily Graphic</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r0440">back</a>]</li></ul>
