            <p class="tei_p">Just been out for a long sleigh ride and had dinner—roast turkey, bread sauce,
                a boiled onion and apple pie—mighty good. Sorry to say it is thawing here,
                likely to lose our snow unless it mercury drops between now and midnight.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All quiet, we are getting ready to start—hope to get off wednesday morning (am
                pretty sure we shall not get off tuesday) &amp; see you thursday. Nothing new in any
                direction, I shall probably not write again (before leaving)</p>
