            <p class="tei_p">i received your
                letter yesterday and the order
                and am very much obliged
                to you indeed the paper came
                to i was amused to read the
                account of the ball and the
                prince s  manovers
                i should
                think by the account he behaved
                with great propriety and
                very good taste in his dress
                and his behavior) well walt
                Georgey
                aint home yet i
                havent heard a word from
                him since he went away
                the 1 of the month i think he
                might just write a line to
                me i expected he would be
                home last saturday but he
                dident come so i suppose
                he will be here this satur</p>
