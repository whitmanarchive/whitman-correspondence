                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    Davidson (1840–1900), a Scottish philosopher and author. It included a

                    the poet with Bruno in his rejection of the "Christian notion of sin as a
                    positive entity" (34). On April 4, 1890, Whitman sent copies of the book to John
                    Addington Symonds, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Gabriel Sarrazin, T. H. Rolleston, and
                    W. M. Rossetti (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of

                    is likely referring to Margaret because he had written to his brother expressing
                    concerns about her health in 1888. See Dowden's letter dated August 20, 1888
