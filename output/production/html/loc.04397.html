                <p class="tei_p">I have not had any opportunity of writing to you since Wednesday morning, when I was at 
                Fenelon Falls.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>—Immediately after dinner Tom Rutherford<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> came for me &amp; drove me out to his farm, 5
                miles out; where I stayed till the following afternoon. I enjoyed the visit immensely. Tom
                himself is a man well worth knowing &amp; we were soon great friends—(for
                Fred Wild's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> sake as well as his own.) He is simply an average farmer—not educated—but a fine
                fellow in all the essential qualities of manhood, cute, intelligent, industrious, faithful, true, &amp;
                a warm-hearted friend, husband &amp; father. My friend Fred Wild thinks a

                lot of him &amp; has kept up a steady correspondence with him for the last 17 years. And it was
                delightful to me to see how deep &amp; warm was the friendship on Tom's side.—And as
                I have heard so much of him for so many years, it was like meeting an old friend of my own.
                At any rate we are friends <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">now</span>!</p> 
                <p class="tei_p">He farms 55 acres, which he has cleared himself. He has had a rough laborious life, but is doing well
                &amp; prospering—though slowly. It was a novel experience to me to see backwood's farming
                &amp; life, but I enjoyed it very much.—I liked too to get out into the "bush"—chipmunks
                calling &amp; playing about me—one little fellow descending a tree
                in front of me &amp; playing about for fully 5 minutes before running off amid the rustling leaves.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">The following afternoon Tom took me down to Sturgeon Point—2 miles away—where I took the steamer
                along Lake Sturgeon to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Bobcaygeon</span>. I called on a friend of Fred Wild's
                there, &amp; stayed all night. Bobcaygeon is quite a pleasure resort during the season—people
                going there from Buffalo &amp; Rochester, &amp; even from Kansas (Indian name, meaning short, shallow
                rapids)—Took steamer back next morning (Friday) to Sturgeon Point &amp; up to Tom's. After dinner
                he drove me back to Fenelon Falls, where I caught the 4 o'clock train here—Tom
                seeing me off with moist eyes.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Reached Haliburton @ 7 oclock. (It is the terminus north of the Grand Trunk Ry.) Was met by

                man whom I heartily like. He has 11 children, nearly all married, &amp; has 3 or 4 sons 
                in the States (Is strongly in favor of Annexation).—Yesterday he took me in a boat to the second lake,
                7 miles from here, to visit a young farmer who is sick. I enjoyed it very much, the hills
                at the sides of the lake wooded down to the water's edge—occasional clearings &amp; farmsteads
                at distant intervals.—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">This morning we have a little rain, &amp; I write this in Mr. S's office overlooking the lake. I propose to leave
