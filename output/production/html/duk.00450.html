            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Lou and Jessie came here yesterday—I
                assure you I was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">gratefull​ </span><span class="tei_corr">grateful​
        
      </span></span>. They took hold immediately with an energy that has advanced
                household comfort, in one day, than I could have accomplished perhaps all
                winter—brought a woman in the house with mop and pail, and scoured the floor,
                alleviating all that stale, dusty, musty atmosphere—drew out a carpet kept in
                reserve, and we put it down—Lou engineering—to a line—then she
                went away and returned having purchased a new carpet for Han's
                sleeping room, and had a stove for winters use set up—bought an arm chair, a
                pair of shades, and had the old

            old lounge or sofa taken away to be <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">repaird​ </span><span class="tei_corr">repaired​
        
      </span></span> in the best possible manner; bot a

      </span></span> for me, cotton and stuff—better perhaps than I had. The stove
                was put in place in our best room—a good heater. The women worked, and so did
                I, until the best shirt I had was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ript​ </span><span class="tei_corr">ripped​
        
      </span></span>, in rags. I told Lou that I had no other—true. She told
                Han that she had intended to have given her some money but could not—she had
                none left.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I wished that she had left 25 dollars for the taxes—but alas—numerous
                persons have contributed, a dollar <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">occasionaly​ </span><span class="tei_corr">occasionally​

                Walt. Han is pretty well.</p>
