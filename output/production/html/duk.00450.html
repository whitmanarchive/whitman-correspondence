                winter—brought a woman in the house with mop and pail, and scoured the floor,
                alleviating all that stale, dusty, musty atmosphere—drew out a carpet kept in

                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
