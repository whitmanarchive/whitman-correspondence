            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">We have passed through a wonderful week for our New York. A week that I think will eventually be productive of great good to our country, but had at a fearful cost. From my own personal observations I think that the newspapers would give one the most perverted kind of an idea of the riot. The big type, the general "skeery" look of the articles, was something that did not make its appearance on the public face. I guess the only wonderfully frightened men were Opdike and Seymour, if we perhaps except the Copperhead dem.'s that incited the rioters on and then deserted them.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Opdike though was awfully frightened. In the flashy, sensation style the papers were all far from the truth, ahead, but when it comes to the killed, they are fa[r]ther from the truth, behind. Undoubtedly we shall never know the full number but I have it from the very best authority—an eye witness of most of the fights, that there are now more than 400 rioters that have paid their lives for their plunder  The papers are not allowed to publish this<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>  I suppose it is much better not to let it be known, but the lesson was fearful and thorough to these men. Yesterday I saw them taking coffins out of the shanties on 2nd Av. piling them on carts and driving right to the cemetery  I understand they have been doing this ever since Monday night. The police covered themselves with glory. They certainly made a splendid fight. They deserve great credit. God only knows where the city of New York would have been had we had Wood's police.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> They did well also in Brooklyn. The scoundrels thought to commence operations in Brooklyn, and did set fire to a couple of grain elevators, but the thing has gone no further. I think that rioting in these parts has received its quietus mostly from that Reg of Michigan boys that the War Dept. were kind enough to send us. I hear that they made fearful havoc with the irish ranks. Twas better so—they did not have that "citizen feeling" that our militia would have had. The only feeling I have is that I fear that they did not kill enough of 'em Walt. I'm perfectly rabid on an Irishman  I hate them worse than I thought I could hate anything. Their conduct for the past week has made me do it. The papers say that the draft is to go on in a day or two in New York &amp; Brooklyn  this is right, I think, and will be a victory over a certain portion of the rebel army. I want, if possible to make a suggestion to this man Fry or whoever has char[g]e of this thing, of a manner in which, I think, the draft can be enforced in these larger cities without endangering riots. My idea is this, to make a certain portion of the city, say certain wards that make a district, not too large, and make the draft, carry the thing out complete, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">get the men in the field</span> and every thing done before drafting in any other part of the same city. The advantages, I think, would be these, you could get along with a much smaller police (military) force as their would be no tendency to mob except in the one district, and when (and this I think would be the great point.) you got all through, the men in the field, the remainder of this whole district would be on the side of the draft and would help enforce it in the next, so that in a short time a majority of the city would <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">want</span> it enforced in the parts where it had not yet been done. The same should be done in Brooklyn  Being the first thing of the kind almost that has ever happened in this country I think a little policy would not come amiss. Another thing I think bad is the publishing of the list of names of the drafted men. This should not be done  I have reasons to suppose that had this not been done in New York they would not have had this organized mob headed by a drafted democratic Alderman<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> and a lot of drafted irishman. Would it be possible for you to do anything in this matter. I mean suggest these ideas to those having the matter in charge. It strikes me Walt that if they could be carried out twould save a great deal of innocent blood  I go in for enforcing the draft at all hasards, and that too without giving in the least to the mob, but if a little politician thing of this kind would help, I think it ought to be done. Won't you try to do something about the matter. Of course all that can be done would be to bring it to the notice of the right parties. Twould defeat the entire thing by giving it publicity. My theory is that before the people found out the thing drafting would be over, and like the fellow that had the tooth out when he had taken laughing gas they would think it a good joke</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yesterdays Herald stated that the 9th Corps were sent in pursuit of Johnson. To-days Times says that they have arrived back in Kentucky. Tis hard to say which is right, perhaps both—more likely neither.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—We want to hear from George much.—Heard from Han 'tother day. She was getting better. heard through Heyde.—Abt. the $300. I'm a little afraid that I shant be able to raise it through Mr Lane as he has been a little unfortunate lately, but still I keep a bold front<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>  I lately got a position where I am getting $90 per month. (through Mr Lane, Tis on the Water Works)  This will be permanent (as long as Mr Lane is here, perhaps for years.) and with such a certain prospect of paying it back in a few months, I think that George would lend me the money. I, by sailing very close, think I could pay him in five months. Dont you think he would be willing? Walt will you write me at once  I want to hear from you, often. All well at home, first-rate. Hope you will come home soon.</p>
         
      
   <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n100">1. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_loc.00418_n100 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00418_n100"><span>Shortly after the Union
                    victory at Gettysburg, the Northern cause was damaged by terrible riots in New
                    York (July 13–16, 1863). Approximately 50,000 people, mainly Irish
                    immigrants, battled police over the application of the Conscription Act. The
                    Irish, who made up over half of the foreign-born population of New York and
                    served as the main source of cheap labor, feared competition from the newly
                    emancipated slaves. With justification, the Irish felt that the draft laws
                    favored the rich. Many Irishmen earned no more than $500 per year and so
                    could not raise the $300 necessary to buy their way out of the draft. Even
                    the Whitmans were worried about how they would obtain $300 if Jeff were
                    drafted, although in the following year the family did manage to raise $400
                    "to pay for a substitute" for Jeff (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</span> [Durham, North
                    Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 130).<p class="tei_p">A primary cause of the riots was
                        the foolhardy administration of the draft. The War Department ordered it at
                        a time when the city was nearly stripped of defenses: Governor Horatio
                        Seymour had sent 16,000 soldiers from New York City to check Lee's thrust
                        into Pennsylvania. The draft was held on a Saturday, thus giving citizens a
                        work-free Sunday to build up resentment. Names of those selected were
                        published in the papers, and it was clear enough that the poor were
                        disproportionately represented. Finally, the draft was conducted on a
                        citywide basis. As Jeff realized, it should have been handled
                        district-by-district, which was exactly what orders had suggested U.S.
                        Provost Marshal General James Barnet Fry should do.</p><p class="tei_p">The riot caused
                        roughly 500 deaths. Particularly vicious attacks were made against blacks,
                        and one black orphanage was set ablaze. Police were able to protect only the
                        lower half of Manhattan as the mobs attacked banks, newspaper offices, and
                        other symbols of wealth and power. The police, badly outnumbered, were
                        supported by Jeff's friend Julius W. Adams who led the Brooklyn National
                        Guard in defense of the offices of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>
                        and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>. Given such violence, Jeff's vindictive
                        comments about the Irish become more understandable.</p><p class="tei_p">The political
                        response to the draft was varied. Fernando Wood, a congresssman whose
                        support came largely from Irish immigrants, denounced the draft. Governor
                        Seymour, who regarded the draft as unconstitutional, was accused of aiding
                        the rioters. George Opdyke, the mayor, had little sympathy for the rioters
                        and vetoed a $2,500,000 Conscription Exemption Bond Bill which would
                        have provided $300 for each drafted man to buy an exemption.</p><p class="tei_p">The
                        riots were stopped only after eleven New York regiments and one from
                        Michigan were rushed to the city at a time when they might have been
                        pursuing Lee. General-in-Chief Henry W. Halleck ordered General George G.
                        Meade to pursue Lee no further than the Rappahannock because more troops
                        might be needed to enforce the draft. After the riots were over, James R.
                        Gilmore of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> urged Lincoln to investigate
                        the causes of the riot, but the president refused, supposedly saying, "One
                        rebellion at a time is about as much as we can conveniently
                    handle."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00418_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00418_n2"><span>Walt Whitman enclosed

                    happen that Jeff should be drafted—of course he could not go, without its
