            <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to get (this morning) your card of 19th
                and to hear that you were feeling passably. I find I have "Dark Blue" for Nov. 7, (as well as oct—the beginning of
                R.N.'s article) but my copy has not the picture (very bad one by the way) [/] I am a
                little sorry therefore I did not take the Nov. n.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">o</span> you offered me. The weather here
                is gloomy but pleasant in temperature. All is well and quiet with us. You might give
                the enclosed receipt to Horace to be handed to Harned—so he will see we settled with the meter Co. I

                is as a great prize</p>
