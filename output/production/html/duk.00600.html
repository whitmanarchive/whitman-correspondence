            <p class="tei_p">i received your letter
            yesterday i was very anxious to hear
            from you i was in hopes your thumb
            had got nearly or quite well but i
            suppose the least little thing irritates it
            and puts it back but if you can only
            come through without any bad effect
            or any stifness you must be content and
                thankful its very tedious to have it so long
                sore but if it comes out all safe at last</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i got the 2 radicals
            one i got one day and
            the other the next i set right down and read
            it that Lady
            seems to understand your writing
            better than ever any one did before as if she
            could see right through you she must
            be a highly educated woman</p>
