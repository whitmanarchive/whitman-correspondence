                        between May 17, 1870 and June 12, 1870, and it more likely dates to early
                        June. The letter has no date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
                        Maurice Bucke conjectured August 1870, but his month is incorrect. Edwin
                        Haviland Miller conjectured June? 1870 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                        1961–77], 2:98, n. 20; 2:368), and Miller's date is corroborated
                        partially by Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's receipt and response to Anne
                        Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman." However, a number of
                        contextual factors allow the letter to date as early as May 17, 1870 and no
                        later than June 12, 1870.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman traveled to Brooklyn in late April or early May, and from there
                        he made a request to William D. O'Connor in Washington D.C.: "If the
                        'Radical' has come, send me a copy immediately" (see Walt's <a href="nyp.00292">May 11, 1870</a> letter to O'Connor). Walt also
                        informed O'Connor that he expected to return to Washington "next Monday"
                        (May 16). Louisa may have received O'Connor's forwarded copy of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical</span> just before or after Walt's return to
                        Washington, but it is more probable that Walt sent a copy of Gilchrist's
                        article to his mother after his return. Walt also forwarded a copy of
                        Gilchrist's article to his brother-in-law Charles Heyde, and Heyde responded
                        in a <a href="duk.00392">June 13, 1870</a> letter to Walt. The date of
                        Louisa's receipt of Gilchrist's article and the date of Heyde's letter
                        establish the outer range of possible dates for this letter. Another detail
                        that may narrow the range of dates is that Heyde wrote of wife Hannah
                        (Whitman) Heyde that a "swelling in her neck has subsided," and in this
                        letter Louisa relays Heyde's report from a letter (not extant) that Hannah
                        "has a swelling on the side of her face and ear has been three weeks that it
                        pains her." Though the calendar dates during which Hannah suffered the pain
                        in her neck and face cannot be established with certainty, Louisa's letter
                        must precede Heyde's June 13 response to Gilchrist's article. Louisa's
                        letter also indicates that she received a letter from Heyde in response to
                        the one that she "wrote [Hannah] last week," and Heyde may acknowledge
                        receipt of that same letter.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The earliest possible date for this letter is the second day after Walt's May
                        16 departure: because Louisa has received copies of Gilchrist's article two
                        days in succession, May 17, 1870 is the earliest possible date. The letter
                        dates no later than a day before Heyde responded to Gilchrist's article,
                        June 12, 1870.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    345–359. The Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical</span> was a Unitarian
                    periodical edited by Sidney H. Morse (1833–1903). Gilchrist's "Woman's
                    Estimate" was based on letters that Gilchrist wrote to William Michael Rossetti
                    after he edited for publication <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Walt Whitman</span></a> (London: Hotten,
                    1868). According to Jerome M. Loving, Rossetti encouraged Gilchrist to have her
                    enthusiastic letters published and forwarded them to William D. O'Connor.
                    O'Connor initially contacted William C. Church and Francis P. Church, editors of
