            </span>
 
            <p class="tei_p">I have been out halting around for a walk, as it is quite pleasant today—But I believe 
                I have overdone the matter, as I have a pretty bad feeling the last hour or two both 
                in the head &amp; left side,—&amp; as I sit here writing,—So your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">limited express</span> seems to be 
                a real success—if it keeps up as well as it has begun I have no doubt it will increase, 
                &amp; be patronised, &amp; become a permanent institution—(I had got the idea, somehow, at first, 
                that the same crew went <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">through</span> from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash.</span>​  to New York, &amp; so was <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01631.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01631.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01631.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>some 
                in hopes of seeing you in Philadelphia)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">No change in my condition or prospects—the young man, Walter Godey, still works as my substitute 
                in the Solicitor's office—I havn't had any word from Eldridge in two months, nor from Mrs. O'Connor 
                in some time—(have you been up there?) Do you see Hinton or Tasistro?—My sister has just called me to my dinner—so I will close for this time.
