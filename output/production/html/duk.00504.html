                    17, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "October 17," and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1867. In his calendar of letters, Edwin Haviland
                    Miller included no letter dated October 17, 1867, but he did reference a letter
                    from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman that he dated to October 7, 1867
                    (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). No other letter from Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman could date to October 7, 1867, so Miller's date must be an error. Louisa
                    stated that she was writing on a Thursday, the day of the week on which October
                    17 fell in 1867. Additional confirmation for the letter's date is that Louisa's
                        <a href="duk.00505">October 20, 1867</a> letter to Walt—which is
                    concerned also with $10 that has gone missing in the mail—refers to
                    this letter as the one she wrote "thursday last." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00465_n9 note" id="duk.00465_n9"><span>Martha Mitchell Whitman
                    (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
                    death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_225.html">Whitman, Martha
