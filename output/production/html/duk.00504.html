            <p class="tei_p">the post
            man has gone bye and
            no letters, and its being 
            thursday i feel worried
            very much for fear it
            is gone as i dident get
            it yesterday my usuall
            day i thought i would
            get it to day i wanted
            very much to hear from
            you and likewise i was
            very short of money but
            if you have sent it it
            is taken sure i think of
            every thing that is unlikely
            to happen O walt if you
            are sick or any thing

            let me know immedtely

            till i hear i wrote A letter
            last week to you walter
            i suppose you got it
            it is too bad if the letter
            is gone i have been waching
            the letter man and he s past
            and no letter i feel real
            bad my lameness is not
            much better yet i am
            taking medicine from
            a doctor a very good one
            i think the one matty had for
                sis he has great practice
            and has a very good name
            he said if this dident help
            me he dident know as any
            thing would but he thought
            this would</p>
