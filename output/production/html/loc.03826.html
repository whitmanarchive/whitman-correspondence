                we come down to breakfast and find something there with your good black hand
                writing—so unlike anybody else's. As I wrote you the books came safely to hand
                and

                are greatly appreciated by our friends who ordered them.
                And that splendid complete volume you sent father—that is a book! You know how to get out such nice
                editions—there is no one who has nicer ones.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have just been having a party of about a dozen young people staying with us to
                help in an "opera" which we wrote and performed last Saturday. It was about

            showing how some women-students got possession of a man's college and turned the men
                out. But alas, when the women were once in they began quarreling—some wishing
                to be serious and study, &amp; some to have a good time— &amp; in the end they all
                eloped with a handsome undergraduate and the men got back their college. It was very
                amusing—my part was to dance a ballet, which I

                friends—each of whom has brought some interesting word with him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In a week now I go back to Oxford—to Balliol College, for my last year. It is a
                dear place. I shall hate to leave it.</p>
