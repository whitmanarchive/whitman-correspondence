            <p class="tei_p">I am still here—not yet (as an old Long Island aunt used to say) "not yet out of my misery" but I go out on the streets, or to the Public Library, most every day, &amp; have no doubt I shall be as well as usual before long—I believe I told you I was in nice quarters &amp; very comfortable here—I send you Mrs Gilchrist's letter, which you needn't return—Gilder's, which I also enclose, I wish you to send back, some time—Upon receiving this, post me a card—tell me how the mother is &amp; 'Sula, also the baby, also Smith—Just got a postal from Mrs Gilchrist giving her address.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The rough map enclosed gives you some idea of my present jaunt, on the red line (the blue lines are old travels of mine)—I have seen the December <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's</span>—What you say of me in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nature &amp; the Poets</span> thoroughly delights, satisfies &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">prides</span> me—I saw in the Library a late London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fortnightly</span> in which J A Symonds, touching briefly but very commendingly &amp; mentioning my name, makes quite an extract from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dem[ocratic] Vistas</span> (summing up the general spirit of British literature as being markedly sombre &amp; bilious)—A B Alcott is expected here, to talk—I may see him—This is quite a place for the most toploftical Hegelian transcendentalists, a small knot but smart—the principal of them, W T Harris, editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Speculative Philosophy</span>, has been often to see me, has been very kind, &amp; I like him much—Probably ten days more will end my stay here, (but I am not fixed)—A fine day as I write, &amp; I am feeling comfortable.
