            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">We all enjoyed the Sun-Set piece very much, Clement gave it a place of honor. It it is very beautiful &amp; profound. Thank you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see by the papers that yr brother Tom is dead. I often think
                of "Jeff," as I saw him at yr house</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I rather admire, so far as I knew him that grim Parnell.
                    Carlyle wd have liked his attitude I
                think—Gladstone seems to dwindle just now in
                comparision—G. whom Carlyle called a man "who always looks at the mere clothes
                of the fact."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am so sorry about that belly-ache business of yours</p>

            <p class="tei_p">E.H. Clement—our Ed. in
                chief seems in no hurry to print our Dutch piece, does he? Well, he will use it some time</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Frau Kennedy sends her love &amp; thanks you for
                remembering her in yr letters</p>

                to get a picture of old Boston 100 years ago in my mind.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How wonderful &amp; grand seems to be Dr Koch's discovery! I 'allus' thot it 'ud come.</p>
