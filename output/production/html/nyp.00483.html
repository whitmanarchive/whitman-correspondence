            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 14th &amp; proofs of 1883 Letter <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —All <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">y'r</span>​  marks will be attended to—the Emerson passages put in as you
                    desire—the text minutely adhered
                to—every correction carried out—with the single exception (if you will
                allow it, as I personally request you will) of restoring the italic non-quoted
                names of books, &amp;c. The typographical plan was laid out by the Superintendant in the printing office &amp; agreed to by the publisher &amp;
                myself—I stipulated that your text should be adhered to without the slightest
                variation—but gave in to the type &amp; technique business, so as to have a
                certain system &amp; uniformity which those names as printed come under—But it
                does not involve any material point &amp; I know you will be entirely satisfied when
                you come to see the Letter and the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] in the printed
                book—Also I request you will allow a few certain ¶ breaks in the G G
                P—not at all affecting the text—but helping the typography &amp;
                reader—I think most decidedly helping—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The foot note (early part of G G P) is printed I see exactly as in copy—If not
                the true note, send it on as you wish, &amp; it shall appear verbatim—(we have
                no fear of scarifying Lowell)—If the exigencies of
                the printing office allow I will have a revise sent you—but it is not
                certain—</p>
