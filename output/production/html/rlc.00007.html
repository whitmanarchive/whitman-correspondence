      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 17th August<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> has just reached me—also the
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dagbladet</span>, (four no's.) The feuilleton about me I have just had read in English by a Dane, Mr.
          Bendz.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I am deeply touched at being more and more brought
        right among warm human hearts in Denmark, Norway, &amp;c—&amp; so friendly entertained
        there. It comforts &amp; nourishes me more than you know. The former letters, &amp; the
        papers you have sent, have all come safely to hand—&amp; I thank you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just returned from a visit of some days to Philadelphia. It is a great <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">materialistic city</span> full of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">middling classes</span>,
        (mechanics, laborers, operatives in factories (both sexes), traders, &amp;c)—in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">extraordinary physical comfort</span>—700,000 people, &amp;
        five–sixths of them well–off, in plenty of the best food &amp; clothing, &amp;
        ample &amp; respectable houses—there are almost <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no</span> very
        miserable &amp; vagabond classes or quarters in the city, vast &amp; teeming as it is. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am now back here at work for the fall &amp; winter—My address is permanently
        here—I get all your letters &amp; papers safely. Clausen<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
        has not yet arrived. I have lately rec'd a paper from Pesth, Hungary, with a feuilleton about my poems. </p>
