            <p class="tei_p"> I read of your age and sickness and your belief that you are not much accepted by
                your generation; but also of the comfort which personal letters of appreciation and
                thanks have been to you. So I will put by every reason that has hitherto hindered me
                from sending a frank message of love and thanks to you, in the thought that my
                message can do no harm, and if it is a small drop of comfort, it may add to others,
                and so amount to something. I blush to read that the tenderest and gratefulest
                breath of thy heart has gone over the sea-gales to England. I mean I am glad for
                them to have had ever so tender a breath of thy heart, but I am very sad to think we
                compatriots should <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01215.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01215.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01215.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01215.004_large.jpg</span> not

            <p class="tei_p"> I know a day will come soon when the "big American magazines" will vie to reprint
                and make head pieces of Walt Whitman's verse. And this is why I know. I was
                nourished and formed by every thing most American, for I am (so to speak) one of the
                children of the war. That overwhelming outburst of spirit was the first thing to
                stamp my nature. My first coherent memory is of the 
                Brooklyn 14<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> Regiment recruiting on Fort Green in 1861. (I then very proud of a dear
                Uncle—Commissary of the Regt., who afterward, down at the "front," had once
                the honor to entertain Walt Whitman in his tent.) And as sure as it was the very
                spirit of democracy that was mother's milk to me, so sure am I that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">therefore</span> I love Walt Whitman—and as whatever is
                most American and democratic must in time lead the rest here—and be served by
                the big magazines as well as the little, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">therefore</span> I know
                Walt Whitman's great heart will still wake the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">echos​ </span></span> from end to end of the country—</p>
