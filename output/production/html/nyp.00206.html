               <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Jeff,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">By Mother's letter I have heard about the moving &amp; the new quarters—Mother says that she is glad they are no worse, under all the circumstances. I enclose an envelope to mother, with a little money in it. As you see, I am still in the same place, with easy times enough, &amp; a good place as I could expect. The Attorney General is absent now in Kentucky. There is not much work. I can't tell whether I shall keep on here, or not. There is nothing at present that looks like a change—I feel quite well this spring—but a clerk's life here is not very interesting—I went down last Thursday to Mt Vernon, 16 miles down the Potomac—I think it is the pleasantest spot &amp; farm I ever saw—went through the house &amp; grounds &amp;c—I was very glad I went—Yesterday we had the funeral here of a man you must have seen mentioned in the papers, old Count Gurowski. I have been very well acquainted with him since I have lived here—he was a strange old man, a great lord in his own country, Poland, owned 30,000 serfs &amp; great estates—an exile for conspiring against the government—he knew every thing &amp; growled &amp; found fault with everybody—but was always very courteous to me, &amp; spoke very highly of me in his book, his "Diary," printed last winter—his funeral was simple but very impressive—all the big radicals were there—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The fight between Congress &amp; the President is still going on—I think the President is rather afraid of going too far against Congress, for Stevens &amp; the rest of 'em are very determined.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">My hospitals are dwindled down to a small force—but there are plenty of cases to occupy me a couple of visits a week—I always go Sunday, &amp; sometimes in the middle of the week—Julius Mason is here in barracks yet—Jeff, I wish I could now &amp; then be home &amp; see you all, even if was only a couple of hours—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my best respects to Mr. Lane, and the Doctor—I send my love to Mat &amp; the little girls. Write &amp; tell me all about home affairs, &amp; how George is getting along—dear old Mother, as she gets older &amp; older, I think about her every day &amp; night—</p>
