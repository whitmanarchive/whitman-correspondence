I enclose an envelope to mother, with a little money in it. As you see, I am still in the same place, with easy times enough, &amp; a good place as I could expect. The Attorney General<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is absent now in Kentucky. There is not much work. I can't tell whether I shall keep on here, or not. There is nothing at present that looks like a change—I feel quite well this spring—but a clerk's life here is not very interesting—I went down last Thursday to Mt Vernon, 16 miles down the Potomac—I think it is the pleasantest spot &amp; farm I ever saw—went through the house &amp; grounds &amp;c—I was very glad I went—Yesterday we had the funeral here of a man you must have seen mentioned in the papers, old Count Gurowski. I have been very well acquainted with him since I have lived here—he was a strange old man, a great lord in his own country, Poland, owned 30,000 serfs &amp; great estates—an exile for conspiring against the government—he knew every thing &amp; growled &amp; found fault with everybody—but was always very courteous to me, &amp; spoke very highly of me in his book, his "Diary," printed last winter—his funeral was simple but very impressive—all the big radicals were there<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The fight between Congress &amp; the President is still going on—I think the President is rather afraid of going too far against Congress, for Stevens &amp; the rest of 'em are very determined.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>

                    (1803–1881) was appointed Attorney General on July 23, 1866, and served
                    until March 12, 1868, when he resigned to serve as President Johnson's chief
                    counsel in the impeachment proceedings. When, at the conclusion of the trial,
                    Johnson renominated Stanbery, the Senate refused to confirm him. Failing

                    1866</a>—forced Stanbery to retire from legal practice in 1878. Speaking
                    to Horace Traubel in 1888, Whitman affirmed his fondness for Stanbery (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;

                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Diary</span> (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1862–1866), a
                    day-by-day account of the war written with a marked partiality toward extreme
                    abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he covered his lost eye with a
                    "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head . . . a powerful topknot, in and out:
                    people always stopped to look at him" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
                        Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [1906–1996], 3:79, 96). O'Connor, who
                    apparently Englished Gurowski's manuscripts (see the letter from Gurowski to
                    O'Connor in Charles E. Feinberg Collection), reported to Whitman, on August 13,
                    1864, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had attempted "to
                    discipline the firemen with a pistol" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Traubel,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, 3:340). Whitman
                    maintained to Horace Traubel, in 1888, that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
                    phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
                        (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> 3:79, 340). Mrs.
                    O'Connor related in a letter on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>,
                    that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott, I did not know that [Walt
                    Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been trying every where to find
                    him to tell him myself" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). In the last volume of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Diary</span>, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first
                    category of his threefold evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume":
                    "Praise," "Half and Half," and "Blame." The Count referred in his entry for
                    April 18, 1864, to Whitman as among "the most original and genuine American
                    hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote (372–373), appended September 12,
                    1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had "shown himself to be animated by a spirit
                    of narrow-minded persecution which would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman
                    inquisitor." Gurowski was praised by Robert Penn Warren in Malcolm Cowley, ed.,

                    the Water Works." When George considered staying in the army after the war, Jeff
                    conferred with Mason; see his letter of <a href="loc.00438">May 14,
                        1865</a>. Mason remained in the army until his death in 1882. According to
                    his letter to Jeff on <a href="loc.00838">January 30, 1865</a>, Whitman
                    wrote to "Captain" Mason the same day; on <a href="loc.00436">February
                        7</a>, Jeff noted that Mason had complied with Whitman's request. Whitman
                    apparently wrote again on February 13, and Mason replied from City Point on <a href="yal.00100">February 16</a> that a box had been sent to George on
                    February 10, and that Whitman's letter would be forwarded by "1st Flag of

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27,
                        1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in
                    the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman
                    wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of
                    money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
                    (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
                    Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00206_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00206_n7"><span>The Brooklyn physician
