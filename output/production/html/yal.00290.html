                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    letter, O'Connor laments: "The difficulty of managing pen and ink is
                    indescribable, and only equalled by the difficulty of putting even the simplest
