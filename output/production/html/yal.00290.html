            <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">recd</span>​  your card yesterday, &amp; also the English paper. This morning Doctor Bucke sends me
                Williams letter. It makes me groan in spirit to think of Williams condition. But

                effort you have made, or if he would take a sea voyage. I think I must go to W. this
                winter &amp; see him. I have some notion of going south to get a glimpse of the
                tropics.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I like your Lippincott paper; it is very dignified &amp;
                impressive, &amp; contains many very effective sentences. I am so glad you are
                writing again. My own health is pretty good. I think I have been much benefited <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00290.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fyal.00290.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00290.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the past fall by
                drinking vichy water. It has reduced my weight about 10 per cent. My belly has gone
                away as if I had been confined. It might be good for you. It is good for those who
                make too much blood &amp; fat. It reduces &amp; thins the blood, &amp;, with me, it
                corrects the too much uric acid. I am eating but two meals a day, the last at 2 1/2 p.m. I sleep much better for it.</p>

It is in the same number that
                poor Gosse gets such a terrible cutting up. The New Zealanders
                book I had not heard of.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your book will doubtless have a checkered career in the future as it has had in the
                past, but I have no more doubt that it is one of the few immortal books than I have
                of my own existence. The world can never long pass it by. If it suffers centuries of
                eclipse &amp; neglect it is bound to come up again.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Study into the causes of your bad spells &amp; I believe you may master them, or
                mitigate them. The bowells are the seat of the difficulty with you, I believe. Dr
                Bucke says he is well, &amp; lecturing on insanity to medical students. I enclose O'C.'s letter.</p>
