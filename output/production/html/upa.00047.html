            <p class="tei_p">Many tokens have you sent me. I love the "riddle song" &amp; ponder it over &amp;
                over, Am at once
                tantalized &amp; pleased. If it were not for the "two little breaths of words" I
                should be content with a vague yet none the less real answering thought—but
                those words set me seeking something more definite.
                William Rossetti and I were talking of it. He &amp; his wife &amp; all his children
                including the last comer—as pretty &amp; sweet tempered a baby as ever
                I saw—all came up &amp; dined with us a Sunday or two ago—&amp; then we

                Italian laziness in him, though practically the most industrious of men. The
                children scampering about, the baby placidly enjoying. Often dear Friend do I
                picture you sitting on one of the benches (may my dream come true!) enjoying the
                fresh breeze that almost always blows there, watching the throngs of Londoners of all
                degrees but chiefly the poor &amp; the hardworking, who come up to breathe it on

                news indeed. Putting together that &amp; the paper that came a day or two before, I
                infer that you are not only going to Dr. Bucke's but are travelling with him. (And
                by the bye I feel very grateful to him for that letter to the paper, for putting an
                extinguisher on those smouldering lies.) So I know you have a good <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">friends​ </span><span class="tei_corr">friend's​

                now—the advantage being unlimited models—incessant nature (a too
                costly business in one's own studio) and also sometimes valuable hints from our best
