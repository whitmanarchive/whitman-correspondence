            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thus saith the old song, and the advice is in the vein
                of true philosophy. Yes, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">philosophy</span>—the purest kind, too, which seeks human
                happiness, and the beguiling pleasantly away of life's toilsome road. * * * I have
                often thought that the people of France are the wisest in the world; for under their
                coating of light-hearted fun—often levity—they hide from people's eyes, and from
                their own too, many things that the English, and we Americans, would sulk over half
                a lifetime. Cares <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">will</span> come: the less you make of 'em, the less they really are.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"Let's dance and sing!"</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Have not the (so called) wise heads made a great blunder,
                then, in putting down the joke, the careless jest, the bit of practical fun, the
                ever-recurring laugh, as signs of idle mind? To my notion, the jolliest chap is the
                deepest philosopher—though he may not know it himself.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The fun that's enjoyed
                to-day, though, must be enjoyed within doors; for rarely have we had such a spiteful
                conspiracy of the elements against out-door comforts, as on this Christmas day for
                '48. The ground since Friday, has been covered with snow and ice. Last night it
                thawed, and now we have a diabolical mixture of snow, slush, and mud. Over and
                around all spreads the densest of fogs—more impenetrable than the style of a
                transcendentalist.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">All the church bells rang merry peals this morning. The chimes of
                Trinity,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">2</a> in particular, gave out an especial ding-dong, in honor of the day. (It is
                somewhat singular that they don't get some fit and proper player upon those chimes.
                We are heartily tired of hearing nothing but an octave run up, and then run
                down—Sunday after Sunday.).....Of course, with such weather, the ladies can't go
                out; and just as of course, the streets and churches are uninviting, and the sitting
                rooms and parlors doubly attractive....A number of balls are forthcoming during the
                current week. At one of them, that of the "Northern Light Association," Martin Van
                Buren<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> is to be present. He and "Prince John"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> are 
                in town; ditto Wm. H. Seward.<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">5</a> The
                latter is pushed by his friends for the U.S. Senatorship. Fillmore<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> is understood to
                be against him. The whigs<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> are quarrelling like the mischief over this and other
                "spoils."</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">The California gold excitement<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">8</a> still rages, and, like most potent
                maladies, it has swallowed up lesser ones, such as the Cholera,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">9</a> the influenza, and
                so forth....A horrid murder, of which the papers will give full particulars, was
                committed in Walnut street, last Friday: the victims, thus far, are two Germans—the
                woman, Maria Kloster,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">10</a> not being dead yet.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">....We have also had a little breeze, from
                the attempted abduction, in broad day, and in one of our most public streets, of a
                young man, a mulatto, who was claimed as his property, by a person named Lee.<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">11</a> The
                latter engaged a couple of men to do the job, and promised them $200 for it. They
                may get the dollars—but it is quite likely they will get a short residence in the
                State Prison, too; as the offence of abduction is a felony here.</p>

                    defeated the incumbant Van Buren in the 1840 election to become the ninth
                    president of the United States. Van Buren was also the Free Soil candidate for
                    president in the 1848 election; the Whig Candidate Zachary Taylor
                    (1784–1850) won the election and served as the twelfth president of the

                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00984_n10 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00984_n10"><span>In 1848, James W. Marshall was employed by 
                John A. Sutter to build a sawmill in what is today Coloma, California. Marshall found several pieces
                of gold, and the news of Marshall's discovery was the beginning of the California
                Gold Rush (1848–1855). The Gold Rush brought hundreds of thousands of people to 
                California in search of gold. As a result of the rapid growth, California was able to enter the Union as a free state
                as part of the Compromise of 1850, while Native Californians and indigenous
                societies were attacked and pushed off their lands by those seeking their fortunes in gold. </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n5"><span>Cholera is a bacterial

                    Marks's home and ignoring Geiger's entreaties asking her to return to him.
                    Geiger went to Marks's house and attacked Marks and Kloster. Marks was fatally
                    wounded, and Geiger, thinking he had killed both Marks and Kloster, also killed
                    himself. Kloster, however, recovered from her stab wounds. For more information,
