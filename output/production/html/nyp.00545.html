                    and May 25. Either O'Connor was in error or Whitman had a lapse of
                    memory. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00545_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00545_n3"><span>On <a href="loc.04871">April 15</a> Whitman received $370 from Donaldson
                    and $304 from Williams. In his Commonplace Book Whitman noted receiving an
                    additional $13 at an unspecified date (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
                    The total, according to Whitman, was $687, but in Donaldson's book the
                    amount is given as $692. The discrepancy apparently stems from the amount of
                    Donaldson's share: he gave it as $375, Whitman as $370. Williams
                    forwarded an additional $8 on June 11. Whitman read his lecture for the
                    fourth time this year in Haddonfield, N.J., on May 18, "without pay, for the
                    benefit of a new Church, building fund, at Collingswood" (Whitman's Commonplace
                    Book). For an account of the sparsely attended lecture, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Review</span>, 9 (1963), 65–66. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00545_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00545_n4"><span>The item, pasted on the
                    first page of the letter, includes the following: "'William D. O'Connor,' says
                    the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial-Advertiser</span> of a former
                    Philadelphian, 'is one of the very few clever writers who do not write enough.
                    The reason may be that, having a Government position in Washington, the salary
                    of which supports him, he has not the need, and without the need the desire for
                    composition is perhaps absent.' The same paper, saying that 'Carpenter' is the
                    best of Mr. O'Connor's stories, adds: 'It is a story of which Walt Whitman is
                    visibly the idealized hero, and it is singularly interesting and
                    rememberable.'" </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00545_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00545_n5"><span>O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hamlet's Note-book</span>. On <a href="loc.03299">January

                    expense." On <a href="syr.00023">March 23</a> he said that the book was to
