                    the 1876 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> some poems were
                    pasted in: these intercalations are visually distinctive both because they are
                    pasted on the page and because Whitman used a different typeface for the titles.
                    In the next issue, however, the poems became fully integrated into the printing
                    of the volume, and he used a typeface matching that of the rest of the
                    book. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
