            <p class="tei_p">Your welcome letter conveying the good news that you are "feeling better still" is
                just to hand. You will have got mine before now telling you I had heard from Wm Gurd &amp; that all was O.K., there
                was a line yesterday from him to Matilda Gurd but nothing special in it. All is
                right but move slower than we figured on. I am real glad you seem pleased with Ed 
                W. I knew he would suit you or I would not have sent him so far—he was with me
                here a long time and I know him well—he is just what he looks a good, simple
                minded, quiet, honest country boy—just the kind you like. (A note just came
                from Wm Gurd—all well but not yet able<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00461.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00461.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00461.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> to fix a date for me to
                go East). Yes I got the Phila "Times" 27 Oct. only a
                middling notice—it is suprising to me how little the average reviewer
                sees—not one of them seem to have the lest idea what you have been driving at
                this last 35 years—guess it will come all right in the end. Rolleston has sent me a copy of his Epictetus (Camelot Series)—it is exactly what I wanted I have been looking it
                over and am delighted with it. Have not yet written to thank him, shall very soon. I
                guess you are going to make more of a recovery than any of the doctors
                suspected—they did not allow enough for that wonderfull physique of
                yours—I wish Pardee &amp; O'Connor were making as good a flight—have heard nothing from
                either of them for some days.</p>
