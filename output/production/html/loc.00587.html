Col Canby<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> who has command of the Union troops in N.M. has had a terrible encounter<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> with Sibley<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> of the Texas Rangers. Canby had only eight hundred white men and one Reg of Mexicans under the renowned <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kit Carson</span>
               <a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>. Sibley had three thousand men our white men done all the fighting for the Mexicans broke and ran at the first fire our men fought like tigers one company of Pikes Peak Boys<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> was cut to peases only seventeen survived the fight  they emptied thirty five Texas saddles the first fire and loss of killed and wounded was about 225 the Texans about 400 as soon as we heard of the battle we made a forced march to the rescue and marched a Reg of men 350 miles in 14 days we marched 120 miles in three days and 80 miles in 24 hours. I think we made the biggest march on record, we understood that Sibley was making an attack on Fort Union<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> the word came to us about sundown after the men had marched 40 miles and had not had their supper and they threw their hats in the air and swore they would march 40 miles farther before they slept and they did  they started off singing the Star spangled banner, Red White &amp; Blue and Yankee doodle  so you can imagine what kind of material this Reg is composed of  we are now at Ft Union without a fight but start in three days to attack Sibley where I expect we shall have as great a battle as ever was known.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Soldiering suits me although it is rather rough at present. we have travelled through mountains and plains and seen many amusing things  we have a splendid chance to study human nature for we have all kinds of men in the Reg we are within one hundred miles of Santa Fe which I suppose is taken by the Texans by this time. men women and children and thousands of head of stock arrive here dailey from that country they are all glad to see the soldiers thre or four companies of the 5th infantry Regulars will march with us we go abreast to Santa Fe. I am afraid this letter will not be very interesting for I dont feel like writing</p>

                    was raised by an abolitionist father, Amasa Soule, who moved the Soule family to
                    Kansas to help fight for Kansas's anti-slavery status. With his father and
                    brother William, Silas was a member of the "Jayhawkers," a band of abolitionists
                    who assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad. Silas was among the Kansas
                    team assembled and brought to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by Richard Swinton to
                    break John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron Stevens out of jail in
                    Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia). In Harrisburg he would have met
                    William W. Thayer, who helped Richard Hinton and Thomas Wentworth Higginson plan
                    the jailbreak. On February 18, 1860, Soule went to Charlestown from Harrisburg
                    and faked public intoxication in order to be imprisoned in the same jail as
                    Hazlett and Stevens, only to be talked out of the jailbreak by them. Soule
                    attended a public memorial for Hazlett and Stevens in Boston, where Thayer and
                    Eldridge were in attendance. After the death of his father in 1860, Soule
                    followed the gold rush to Denver, but enlisted in the Union army as soon as news
                    of the war reached him. In 1864 Soule defied orders by refusing to join Colonel
                    John M. Chivington's attack on a group of unarmed native americans, which later
                    came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Soule would later testify against
                    Chivington in hearings in Denver. Soule married Hersa Coberly, the daughter of a
                    pioneer family, on April 1, 1865. Three weeks later he was murdered on the
                    streets of downtown Denver by a private from the Second Colarado infantry and an
                    accomplice. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00587_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00587_n2"><span>Edward R. S. Canby was
