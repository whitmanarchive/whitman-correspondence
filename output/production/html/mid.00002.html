                    was born in Brooklyn; he was the son of William Wise (1814–1903)
                    and Amanda Wise (1818–1891). Alfred's father William was a jeweler for more than
                    seventy years; the Wise's firm was the pioneer jewelry house in Brooklyn 
                    when it was founded in 1834 ("Alfred F. Wise, Well Known Jeweler Dies," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Brooklyn Daily Times</span>, July 12, 1924, 2). 
                    Alfred became a partner in his father's jewelry business in the
                    1850s, at which time the business was renamed William Wise &amp; Son. William
                    and Alfred Wise are listed in the Brooklyn Directory for 1866–1867 as
                    living at 233 Fulton St., Brooklyn (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished

                    Press, 1984], 2:837). According to United States census records, Alfred worked first as a dealer in watches and, later,
                    was listed as a retail jeweler and merchant. He was married to Mabel 
                    Alden Bunker (1862–1956); the couple did not have any children. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n5002d">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_xml:id_n5002d tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n5002d"><span>This letter has not been

                    published in 1865. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln occurred while <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> was being printed, and Whitman promptly added
                    the short poem "Hush'd be the Camps To-day," with a note about Lincoln's death
                    to the final signature of the book. Whitman then decided to stop the printing
                    and add a sequel to the book that would more fully take into account Lincoln's
                    death. Copies of the volume were withdrawn so that the sequel could be added.
                    Whitman hastily composed several poems, adding eighteen new poems to those that
                    appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, and all of these poems were
                    published in a second edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to Drum-Taps</span>
                    (1865–1866). Later, these poems were folded into <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves
                        of Grass</span>, and by the time the final arrangement of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was printed in 1881, the "Drum-Taps" cluster that
                    Whitman included in that volume contained forty-three poems. For more

                in late December 1862 after searching for his brother, George W. Whitman (1829–1901), a Union soldier in
                the American Civil War, who had been wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg.
                Walt Whitman would remain in Washington, D.C. for a decade, volunteering in the Civil
                War Hospitals and, later, performing clerical tasks for several government
                offices. For more information on Whitman's time in Washington, see Martin G.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
