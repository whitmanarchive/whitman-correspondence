                    4, 1869. The date "March 4" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
                    date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New
                    York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The year corresponds with a
                    series of late-term pardons by the outgoing President Andrew Johnson, and it
                    corresponds also to George Washington Whitman's difficulty in obtaining
                    financing for his housing business, which led him to request a loan from Walt
                    Whitman (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00576">March 15, 1869</a> letter to
                    Walt). This letter, which precedes the letter with the loan request by eleven
                    days, explains the financing difficulties that George had encountered from loan
                    agents. </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00575_n9 note" id="duk.00575_n9"><span><p class="tei_p">Thomas Jefferson Whitman
                        (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For

                        Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see

                    sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
                    pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    that George Washington Whitman would follow Walt's advice and have a mortgage

                    there will be no other claim on it and i think it has been a good thing for Jeff
                    as well as george." According to the understanding at this time, Jeff agreed to
                    lend George $3,000. Jeff sent George installments of $200 per month (see
                    Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt:
                        The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</span> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State

                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:79–80, n. 11). However, according to
                    Louisa's <a href="duk.00581">June 23, 1869</a> letter to Walt, Jeff
                    initially agreed to lend George $1,000 and had agreed to lend an additional
                    $3,000 in exchange for a mortgage. But Jeff, who had only sent George
                    $2400 toward the mortgage, wanted to be repaid the initial $1,000
                    immediately—even though Jeff had ceased making $200 monthly payments
                    on the promised $3,000 while $600 short of $3,000. In mid-March 1869
                    Louisa asked Walt to lend George $600, and Walt apparently agreed (see
                    Louisa's <a href="duk.00576">March 15, 1869</a> letter and Jeff's <a href="loc.00453">March 25, 1869</a> letter to Walt). The reason that
                    Walt could be "offended at any thing i said" is uncertain, but George may have
                    hinted already that he would ask Walt for a loan and so had become anxious about
                    Walt's silence on the matter. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00575_n2 note" id="duk.00575_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman

                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n12">11. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00575_n12 note" id="duk.00575_n12"><span>Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
                    Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
                    Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Late in 1868 Hannah suffered a
                    thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance her wrist in November
                    and to amputate her thumb the following month. For Louisa's report on the
