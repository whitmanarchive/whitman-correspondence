            <p class="tei_p">i waited thinking
            i should have some word
            from jeff or mat
 but we
            have not so i thought if
            you dident hear from me
            you would think perhaps
            i hadent got the money
            order but i have i got
            it on tuesday all safe and
            very acceptable) we are
            having a snow storm here
            for the inaugeration day
                maybee it dont storm in
                washington though) i am
            pretty well except a pain
            in my side i am subject 
            to it when i get the least
            cold i sent edd to the drug
            store and got some good
            strong mustard and have
            put a plaister on)

            george asked me the other
            day why Walt never said
            any thing about the house
            if he was offended at any
            thing i said
            no i dident
            suppose he was that you
            was probably in a hurry when
            you wrote and dident think
            the houses is pretty well
            along but george hasent
                got any loan on smiths
                house yet he expected
            to get three thousand dollars
            on it but hasent got any yet
            the agents for loaning money
            say they never knew such
            a time every one that has mony
            to loan gets govermt bonds
            georgey has been in lots
            of trouble about his paymen
            he has had i beleive about
            2000 doller of Jeff but he is
            in hopes of getting a loan
            on smiths house if he dont
            get disappointed again
            you see he has paid all
            along for both as they went
            on dident think he would

            have any difficulty in
            getting the loan on such good
            security) i told him i wouldent 
            worry so much about
            it but you know george
            is so prompt about paying
            the bills as they come due
            i have looked some for
             mary but i hope she wont come now till we move
                we will have a roome
                for you walt maybee
            you can come if nothing 
            happens about the 4th of July
            and stay a week and then come
            again when your vacation
            is) i suppose there is stirring
            times to day at washington
            it seems that the old codger
            has done all the good or
            harm he could in the way
            of pardons some is good
            perhaps)
            but many i should
            think ought not to have been
            well walter dear i hope
            this will find you well
            and love to the Oconors it is
            so nice you can go there to tea

            not a word from han)
                mr Lane has had a letter
            from Jeff it seems their
            concern has overflowed
            once on account of
            the great rise of the
            river but it was so
            far advanced that it
            dident doo much harm
            only stopped the progress
            of the work for awhile
