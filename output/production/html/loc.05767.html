            <p class="tei_p"> Your card<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> (your very voice &amp; touch, drawing me
                across the Atlantic close beside you) was put into my hand just as I was busy
                copying out "With husky, haughty lips O sea" to pin into my "Leaves of Grass." I
                hardly think there is anything grander there. I think surely they must see that that
                is the very Soul of Nature uttering itself sublimely. </p> 
            <p class="tei_p"> Who do you think came to see us on Sunday? Professor Dowden.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> And I know not when I have set eyes on a more beautiful
                personality. I think you would be as much attracted towards him as I was. It was he
                who told me (full of enthusiasm) of the Poems in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's</span> which I had not seen or
                heard of.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> We had a very happy two or three hours together, talking of you &amp;
                looking through Blake's drawings. He is a tall man, complexion tanned &amp; healthy,
                nose finely modelled, dark eyes with plenty of life &amp; meaning in them, hair
                grayish—I should think he was between forty &amp; fifty—but says his
                father is still a fine hale old man. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">4</a> disappointed again this year of getting anything into the
                R. Academy. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I think I like the idea of the shanty, if you have any one to take good care of you,
                to cook nicely, keep all neat &amp; clean &amp;c. I wonder if I have ever been in
                Mickle St. I, still busy, still hammering away to see if I can help those that
                "balk" at "Leaves of Grass". Perhaps you will smile at me—at any rate it bears
                good fruit to me—I seem to be in a manner living with you the while. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Everything full of beauty just now here, as no doubt it is with you. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Good-bye, dearest friend—don't forget the letter that is to come soon. Love
                from us all, love &amp; again love from </p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
