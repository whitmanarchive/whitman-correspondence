            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I write to tell you how things are going now about the translation, &amp;c. It is nearly through its last stage. Our way of working
                is this. First I translated all I am going to give as well as I could out of my own
                unassisted resources and handed over the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="manuscript​ ">M.S.</span>​  to my colleague. He then read it
                over carefully with the English text &amp; made such notes &amp; corrections as occurred
                to him. Then he handed the notes &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="manuscript​ ">M.S.</span>​  back to me. All this is now done, &amp; at
                present I spend the evening in reading a portion of the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="translation​ ">transl.</span>​  with his notes,
                &amp; considering all carefully—next morning I visit my colleague &amp; we go over what
                I prepared the previous night, weighing every sentence; and give final shape to
                the translation. In the afternoon I write out for the printer what we have done in
                the morning. I have now ready for print the Song of Myself, Starting from Paumanok,
                I Sing the Body Electric, Song of the Open Road, Brooklyn Ferry, and a
                dozen or so of the shorter poems. We were at work this morning on 'Salut au Monde.'</p>
                <p class="tei_p">As to publishing, I am trying to get a Dresden <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00054_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00054_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00054_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">syr_kc.00054_large.jpg</span> man, Heinrich Minden, to take it
                upon commission. He is now away in Moskow, on business, but returns in a few days. I
                have written to broach the matter. Curious fact illustrative of rule in Russia—I
                wanted to send Minden my <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="translation​ ">transl.</span>​  of 'Starting from Paumanok,' with my preface to
                the work and Freiligrath's<a href="#n0248" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0248">1</a> article from the Allg. Zeitung. But
                they told me at his office that if I ever wished to see these things again I had
                better not despatch them—as this highly revolutionary or explosive literature
                would assuredly be confiscated on the frontier by the Russian police! So I left them
                in the office, where I suppose they will label them 'dangerous,' and put them on an
                upper shelf till Minden comes back. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The German colleague I alluded to is not a partner in the strict sense &amp; takes
                no part in the publication of the work, nor has legal responsibility for it. His
                name is Gustav Adolf Israel<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—he is master for
                German literature in a school here—I have known him for long, &amp; knowing his
                capacities engaged him for a fixed sum of money to revise my <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="manuscripts​ ">M.S.S.</span>​ . You must not let
                his name be known—it would have serious consequences for him if he were known to
                have taken any part in the production <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00055_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00055_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00055_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">syr_kc.00055_large.jpg</span> of the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G</span>​ . No one supposes
                that the book will be much of a success, financially speaking. A bookseller told me
                the other day that no one reads poetry now in Germany, or buys it, except to give
                pretty books as presents to young ladies on their confirmation. But then as a
                leading critical organ here, anent my lecture, asserted that the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  are not
                poetry, perhaps there is a chance for them! I have not gone into detailed criticism
                in my preface—said that if anyone didn't see his way to calling the book 'poetry,'
                he might call it by any other earthly name he liked, if he would only begin to
                listen to it. Gave a sketch of your life, in which I have corrected some mistakes I
                made in my lecture, &amp; gave your letter, i.e. the portion you wrote for this
                purpose. I mean to give the English text, but not on alternate
                pages—underneath, in smaller type, on the bottom ⅓rd of the page, so as to
                give the idea that it is there for reference, making the German rendering the main
                thing, as it should be for German readers. But this is a good deal dependent on the
                publisher &amp; his opinion. We are thinking of leaving Germany about the middle of
                September. My address then will be Glasshouse, Shinrone, Ireland.

                    poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his <a href="rlc.00001">January 16, 1872</a> letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
                    wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." Freiligrath's review in the
                    Augsburg <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Allgemeinen Zeitung</span> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
                    in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gesammelte Dichtungen</span> [Stuttgart: G. J.
                    Göschen, 1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's
                    poetry on the continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Eclectic Magazine</span>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see
                    also Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Abroad</span> (Syracuse:
                    Syracuse University Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in
                    Walter Grünzweig's "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects numerous
                    examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
                    readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
                    translation. A sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sonntagsblatt</span> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
                    for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
                    Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E.
