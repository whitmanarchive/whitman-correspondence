            <div class="section"><p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter this morning. It is too bad you don't get my letters 
                Tuesday, as I send them in ample time Monday—they are in the p. o. here by noon, 
                &amp; the mail don't close till about 6 p. m.—then the letters get in 
                New York by ½ past 5 Tuesday morning—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">We have had very hot weather—I thought about you—it is quite oppressive 
                on me this summer—still I get along quite well—get along pretty well nights—but every time the middle of the summer comes round, I think I will never stay 
                through another summer in Washington, if I can help it—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday noon</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">11th</span>—We are having a very hot day—How do you all like the nomination of Seymour and Blair?
                It is a regular old Copperhead Democratic ticket, of the rankest kind—probably pleases the old democratic bummers around New York and Brooklyn—but every where else they take it like a bad dose of medicine—the democrats are dissatisfied here, the worst kind—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">O'Connors have had quite a serious falling out with Mrs. Burroughs—John is away yet—may call upon you on his way home. Mrs. B. is a curious woman—but has been very kind to me—Of course you mustn't let on that you know any thing—only you might mention to him that 
                I often write about the wife's &amp; his kindness to me—but probably it is doubtful if he calls—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am sitting here by my window in the office—I dont have the smell of any streets or gutters—but it is burning hot, 
                &amp; hardly any air stirring—fortunately we have moderate nights—&amp; so I manage to get along—</p></div>
            
            <div class="section"><span class="tei_dateline"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1868-07-13">Monday morning 13th</span></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It still keeps hot, &amp; no rain—I was up at O'Connor's a while last evening—Ellen O'Connor is quite sick—has a bad attack of dysentery—the rest are all well—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing decided yet about who shall be attorney General—every thing goes on as usual in the office—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, I must close—it is now a little after 10—there is a pleasant breeze blowing in from the river, quite refreshing—Good by for the present, &amp; love to you &amp; all, mother dear.
