                    earlier in the year (see Whitman's <a href="loc.02826">February 8,
                        1876</a> letter to Whitelaw Reid) as well as sympathetic reports on
                    January 29 and February 25, 1876, and excerpts from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two
                        Rivulets</span> on March 1, 1876, the newspaper, probably through the
                    influence of Bayard Taylor (see Whitman's <a href="uva.00348">November 18,
                        1866</a>, to Taylor), began to publish hostile notices. On March 28, 1876,
                    the London correspondent assailed Buchanan's article in the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily News</span>. An editorial on March 30, 1876, also attacked
                    the recklessness of Buchanan's charges, and maintained that Whitman failed to
                    save money from his Washington days, "the cause thereof was certainly not
                    'persecution.' " Another hostile editorial appeared on April 12, 1876.
                    Burroughs' defense was published on April 13, 1876. On April 22, 1876, O'Connor,
                    Walt Whitman's estranged friend, wrote an extravagant, and garrulous, encomium.
                    Later the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> resumed its friendly attitude toward
                    Walt Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00442_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="med.00442_n3"><span>Franklin B. Sanborn
                    (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Walt Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
                    reviewed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> in the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commonwealth</span> on February 24, 1866 (Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, lviii). He was editor of the Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
                    his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
                    appeared without Sanborn's name in the Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K.
