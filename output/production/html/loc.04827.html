                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    (1861–1934). The book devotes much attention to Whitman, and Lynch writes
                    that Whitman "has the true poet's largeness of soul" but "lacks a little the

                    Greenhalgh wrote that "Walt has taught me 'the glory of my daily life and
                    trade.' In all the departments of my life Walt entered with his loving
