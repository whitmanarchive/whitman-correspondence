            <p class="tei_p">I received this morning yours of March 14th<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—I am deeply sensible of the interest you have taken for me and return my sincere and heartfelt thanks for it. The position—although very desirable in all respects is one that I am not in the least qualified to fill—it is an entirely different branch of the profession from that in which I have been engaged—My Engineering education and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">entire experience</span> has been in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">construction</span> of work[s], such as laying out masonry, location and the general superintendance of building a piece of work—As a draughtsman I am totally deficient—my efforts in that direction being limited entirely to a rough pencil sketch to convey the idea of what is wanted to the workman—Therefore I am certain that I am not qualified and could not justify your generous recommendation of me for the appointment</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hoping sir, that I may some time personally thank you for the trouble you have taken and kindness shown me I am very respectfully</p>

                    civil servant, Wiliam Douglas O'Connor (1832–89) gained lasting fame as
                    the champion of Whitman. O'Connor's panegyric <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray
                        Poet: a Vindication</span> (New York: Bunce and Huntington, 1866) helped
                    define a new role for Whitman, a role which seems to have shaped in subtle but
                    far-reaching ways the closing decades of the poet's career. See Jerome Loving,
