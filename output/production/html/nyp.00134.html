            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I received this morning yours of March 14th—I am deeply sensible of the interest you have taken for me and return my sincere and heartfelt thanks for it. The position—although very desirable in all respects is one that I am not in the least qualified to fill—it is an entirely different branch of the profession from that in which I have been engaged—My Engineering education and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">entire experience</span> has been in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">construction</span> of work[s], such as laying out masonry, location and the general superintendance of building a piece of work—As a draughtsman I am totally deficient—my efforts in that direction being limited entirely to a rough pencil sketch to convey the idea of what is wanted to the workman—Therefore I am certain that I am not qualified and could not justify your generous recommendation of me for the appointment</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hoping sir, that I may some time personally thank you for the trouble you have taken and kindness shown me I am very respectfully</p>

               <span class="tei_signed">Yours Cdially Thos J. Whitman</span>
