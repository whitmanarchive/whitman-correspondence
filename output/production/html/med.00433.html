      <p class="tei_p">Your notes<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> inviting me to write about Spiritualism reached me during a late severe spell of illness, 
        which will account for their not being answered at the time. I thank you for your courtesy, 
        but I am neither disposed nor able to write anything about this so-called Spiritualism. 
        (It seems to me nearly altogether a poor, cheap, crude humbug.)
