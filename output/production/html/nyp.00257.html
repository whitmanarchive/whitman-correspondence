            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, Jeff has been to see me at last—he left yesterday morning—I wish he could have staid a few days longer—He seemed to be well pleased with his visit, &amp; I am sure it was a great comfort to me—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I rather like my new quarters—at any rate they are better than where I was previously—they are very good on some accounts, &amp; not so good on others—but one must not expect perfection. When you write tell me how Jeff got home—We are having pleasant weather here now—the ice &amp; snow are all gone—Mother, do you see the papers much? I can send papers to you, only they would be rather old by the time you get them. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, I left my letter awhile, &amp; have been out taking a walk, &amp; now return &amp; finish my letter—It is quite like summer—I looked for an Almanac but couldn't find any to suit me—I am going out to Georgetown, &amp; will find one there—I will send it to-morrow<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a>—The O'Connors are much pleased with Jeff—Mrs. O'Connor has taken a real liking to him—<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hope this will find you relieved of your rheumatism—I send my love to Matty &amp; George &amp; all.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a></p>
