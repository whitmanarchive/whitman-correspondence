                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their

                    Philadelphia from 1876 to 1878; Whitman visited their home almost daily and even
                    had his own room. From April 1878, to 1879, the Gilchrists lived in Concord,
                    Boston, and New York, before returning to England. Anne's son Herbert

                    (1851–1935) was the son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, the only of their four
                    children who did not accompany their mother to Philadelphia in 1876 when she met
                    Whitman, as Percy Gilchrist was newly married to Norah Fitzmaurice at the time.
                    At about the same time, Percy Gilchrist collaborated with his cousin Sidney
                    Gilchrist Thomas on refining the Bessemer process for the mass production of
                    steel from 1875 to 1877. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
