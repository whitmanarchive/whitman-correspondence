                    with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
                    Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with
                    William over the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor
                    supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William established
                    a separate residence. The correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as
                    voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
                    relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00945_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00945_n2"><span>Martin F. Conway was the
                    first U.S. Congressman, a Republican, from Kansas. He had served as a vocal
                    opponent to slavery—and even spent January 1, 1863, the day the
                    Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, in Massachusetts with Ralph Waldo
                    Emerson, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Julia Ward Howe. That
                    same month, he introduced a resolution before Congress calling for recognition
                    of the Confederacy, so that war with the South might be fought as a war between
                    nations. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00945_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00945_n3"><span>Charles Joseph Howells,
                    according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
                    perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
                    an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
                    in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00945_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_revised tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00945_n4"><span>"William &amp; Charlie"
                    probably refer to William Douglas O'Connor and Charles Eldridge, both of whom
                    received at least two letters from Whitman in late June and early July. Charles
                    W. Eldridge was one half of the Boston based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer
                    and Eldridge, who put out the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>. In December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George
                    in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered
                    Eldridge, who had become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and
                    eventually obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the
                    army paymaster. For more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donald,

                    Thayer from this period. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00945_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00945_n5"><span>William F. Channing

                    scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
