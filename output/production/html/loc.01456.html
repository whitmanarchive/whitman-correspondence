            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to see again once more a scrawl from you, even in a paper. I felt also glad to see there is someone 
                else more gifted <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">then​ </span><span class="tei_corr">than​
        
      </span></span> me trying to honour you and make your 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Work</span> known in our Old land. 
                I noted the French Review—fain
                would I have read it, but alas I can only read my own tongue. I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">often</span> and 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">often</span>—wish one could conjure up some Spirit to give one the meaning of much 
                I see in other tongues, but alas though I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">often call</span> up spirit alas—comes 
                to aid me at my call. Well to <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_me">cease</span> 
                I got your Essay on Burns reprinted here in two local papers. I enclose one rejoinder 
                from a canny Scot, a decent soul, a man that came here a Journeyman and now is the working Manager of 500 men.
                he is also a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Ryhmer​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Rhymer​
        
      </span></span> one little Sketch of his I enclose you.
                you will see he is of a narrow school of thought, wants <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">width</span>, 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">he has</span> got a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good heart though</span></p>

            <p class="tei_p">I must confess I felt <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">disapointed​ </span><span class="tei_corr">disappointed​
        
      </span></span> somewhat in the Burns. 
                I fear you are not well up in Burns' Life. he was to all intents and purposes a Nature akin to yours. 
                true not so wide, not so democratic, still a democrat. he lost promotion through his sympathy with the 
                French Revolution 1793—he sent some guns to them which were stopped. that speaks for the man's sympathy
                with the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cause</span> of man. Carlyle's Essay on him and 
                his Poems is by far the justest I have read with <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Lockheart​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Lockhart​
        
      </span></span>'s 
                Life of him. feeling how much there is of real Kinship between your two natures I felt sorry to find you 
                had not fully grasped the hand of my Hero of Scotland in 1793. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">A man's a man for ah 
                    that."</span> what a cheering voice that is to any soul that is able to read it. 
                then again his idea that even 
                "auld Nick "might be saved if he only would take a thought and mend" is the widest stretch of true charity I
                find in any—Poetry. I find his poetry comes home to the heart of all human Kind. I find in my travels 
                and talks with men, many of their poor hard 
                toiling souls to whom his Poems are the very gospel of consolation and hope.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hope you will look it up again for us if possible. He will repay some thought I think I only wish I 
                had you here beside me, then we could talk it over together so nicely. the stray notices I could place
                into your hands would enable you to see the full <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">man</span>. I feel glad you have done
                what you have, but yearn for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">more</span>. give us Essays on Emerson
                &amp; Tennyson. I often try to make out for myself what you really think of these two men.
                you are so dear to me, I often wish I was by your side. I feel there is so much I sympathise 
                and love in Literature.—that we could chat over. and I think <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">where​ </span><span class="tei_corr">were​
        
      </span></span>
                it so, how many nice Essays would be done that would rejoice the hearts of brothers in the same grand school 
                of human sympathy. the great hearts of our Time are <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">begginning​ </span><span class="tei_corr">beginning​

            <p class="tei_p">I learn with sorrow and deep regret, your Poems are still a venture of your own. are your pupils too poor? 
                What are we think you? if our prophet starve? excuse me being <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">to​ </span><span class="tei_corr">too​
        
      </span></span> 
                bold: The great heart of America surely cannot long allow this to be true? or is it the penalty all prophets 
                pay for being such to a people? Well I hope <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sunshine</span> will come, and that soon. 
                If I can in anyway be helpful let me know. I can at least try. we are far apart that is true. 
                yet even here something I might do as a manifestation of my love and fellowship. I enclose some 
                cuttings that have been saved for your reading. with a kind of boy's care I have 
                gathered them. I would have sent them by news post, only I was afraid they would get lost, so thought this way 
                was the best. I write you these few lines, simply as a quick reply to your scrawl, not by any means all I 
                hoped to write you. If silent never once think you are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">forgotten</span> 
                even by one of the Old land.</p>
