                I noted the French Review—fain
                would I have read it, but alas I can only read my own tongue. I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">often</span> and

            <p class="tei_p">I must confess I felt <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">disapointed​ </span></span> somewhat in the Burns. 
                I fear you are not well up in Burns' Life. he was to all intents and purposes a Nature akin to yours. 
                true not so wide, not so democratic, still a democrat. he lost promotion through his sympathy with the 
                French Revolution 1793—he sent some guns to them which were stopped. that speaks for the man's sympathy
                with the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cause</span> of man. Carlyle's<a href="#n1065" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1065">3</a> Essay on him and 
                his Poems is by far the justest I have read with <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Lockheart​ </span></span>'s<a href="#n0365" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0365">4</a> 
                Life of him. feeling how much there is of real Kinship between your two natures I felt sorry to find you 
                had not fully grasped the hand of my Hero of Scotland in 1793. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">A man's a man for ah 
                    that."</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">5</a> what a cheering voice that is to any soul that is able to read it. 
                then again his idea that even 
                "auld Nick "might be saved if he only would take a thought and mend" is the widest stretch of true charity I
                find in any—Poetry. I find his poetry comes home to the heart of all human Kind. I find in my travels 
                and talks with men, many of their poor hard 
                toiling souls to whom his Poems are the very gospel of consolation and hope.</p>

                    Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856,

                    as Scotland's national poet. An early Romantic poet who wrote in both Scots and
                    English (often though not exclusively inflected by Scottish dialect), Burns is
                    perhaps best known for his poems "Auld Lang Syne," "Tam o' Shanter" and "To a
                    Mouse" (from which the title of John Steinbeck's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Of Mice and
                        Men</span> is derived). Of Burns, Whitman wrote in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
