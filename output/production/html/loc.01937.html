            <p class="tei_p">I do not forget what I am owing to you, and try in every way to raise <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">something</span> towards 
                discharging my obligation to you. But I have been losing, instead of gaining, for some time. I know that sometime 
                I shall have a good business, but that don't help matters for the present. In order to tide over the dullness, I 
                have accepted proofreading outside of my business, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="although​ ">altho'</span>​

                Without being asked, you may be certain I shall send if but a small amount <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">as soon as I can</span>. 
                You would be surprised if you knew

                exactly what I have had to contend with in the way of obstacles for some time. I am occupied at proofreading from 
                7:30 A.M. till 5:30 P.M., with only a ½ hr. for lunch at noon. My business is in the hands of a rural boy, &amp; 
                I attend to my correspondence from 4 A.M. till 6:30 A.M. &amp; from 7:30 to 10 P.M. &amp; sometimes later, and Sundays. 
                I can still do nothing but ask for your indulgence. But my mortification at having to ask you to wait, under all the 
                circumstances, is very great. Sometime I hope to make amends and a personal explanation.</p>

                    Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875, Somerby assumed the liabilities of
                    Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's <a href="loc.01718">February 4, 1874</a>,
                    letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
                    embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
                    unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On <a href="loc.01934">May
                        5, 1875</a>, he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
                    position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On <a href="loc.01936">October 4, 1875</a>, Somerby sent $10—his
                    only cash payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require,
                    and find it utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would
                    accept our offer to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our
                    indebtedness to you." On <a href="loc.01937">April 19, 1876</a>, Somerby
                    reported that "I have been losing, instead of gaining." On <a href="loc.01939">May 6, 1876</a>, he sent Whitman a statement
                    pertaining to some volumes; on <a href="loc.01938">May 12, 1876</a>, he
                    included a complete financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one
                    cash payment, and owed Walt Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to
                    make a payment on <a href="loc.01940">September 28, 1876</a>. In August
                    1877, Whitman received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
                     from, in his
                    own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
                    Somerby." These manuscripts are in The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, 
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01937_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.01937_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:
