            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The good ship 'Crystal' landed me safe at Leith a fortnight &amp; more ago, after a
                voyage of 14½ days, which I relished greatly. I was the only passenger on
                board, &amp; so there was nothing to spoil the native sea-sentiment. For reading I
                had Hugo's<a href="#n4276" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4276">1</a> "Les Miserables" &amp; Chapman's Homer, &amp; I read
                all the sea-poems in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> with a fresh zest.
                After so many months in your new world, you can imagine how Edinburgh (Leith is the
                port of Edinburgh) affected me with its fine antiquity, its Walter-Scott-like<a href="#n4277" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4277">2</a> atmosphere of old Scotch city life, &amp; all the rest of
                it. From the Castle, which overlooks the whole place, I had an inspiring vision of
                the past on my first afternoon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By this time I have fallen into the old routine again more or less. One day passes
                very much like another, &amp; unluckily the weather has <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03330.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03330.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03330.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03330.002.jpg</span> been of the proverbial British

                this house is a great stretch of grassy land,—called the Town Moor, whence one
                gets a superb sweep of sky, &amp; there I often go &amp; ramble about, sometimes
                with a book for company. I shall very probably be here for another fortnight, &amp;
                then go to London for a week or two before going on to Wales where I may spend the  
                autumn.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was troubled to hear on reaching this side that you had been more than usually
                unwell, but Walter Scott's<a href="#n4147" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4147">3</a> people tell me that they have had better news, which

                    was bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
