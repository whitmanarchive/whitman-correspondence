            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The good ship 'Crystal' landed me safe at Leith a fortnight &amp; more ago, after a
                voyage of 14½ days, which I relished greatly. I was the only passenger on
                board, &amp; so there was nothing to spoil the native sea-sentiment. For reading I
                had Hugo's "Les Miserables" &amp; Chapman's Homer, &amp; I read
                all the sea-poems in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> with a fresh zest.
                After so many months in your new world, you can imagine how Edinburgh (Leith is the
                port of Edinburgh) affected me with its fine antiquity, its Walter-Scott-like atmosphere of old Scotch city life, &amp; all the rest of
                it. From the Castle, which overlooks the whole place, I had an inspiring vision of
                the past on my first afternoon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By this time I have fallen into the old routine again more or less. One day passes
                very much like another, &amp; unluckily the weather has <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03330.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03330.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03330.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> been of the proverbial British
                kind,—wet, cold &amp; austere, six days out of seven. Within easy reach of
                this house is a great stretch of grassy land,—called the Town Moor, whence one
                gets a superb sweep of sky, &amp; there I often go &amp; ramble about, sometimes
                with a book for company. I shall very probably be here for another fortnight, &amp;
                then go to London for a week or two before going on to Wales where I may spend the  
                autumn.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was troubled to hear on reaching this side that you had been more than usually
                unwell, but Walter Scott's people tell me that they have had better news, which
                relieves my mind again.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Democratic Vistas</span> vol. is getting many first rate
                reviews. I will send some of these on presently. Meanwhile how goes the new book?
                Let me know if I can be of use in circulating it over here. Remember me to
                    Traubel. Also to Mrs. Davis &amp;
                other friends</p>

                    had a note from Gilchrist. He speaks of paying another
                    visit to America in the autumn,—"to paint portraits. At present he is
