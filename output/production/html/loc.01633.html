            <p class="tei_p">Well Pete, my dear loving boy, I have just come in from a 15 minutes walk outside, 
                with my little dog—it is now ½ past 1 Friday afternoon—the bright sun shining, 
                &amp; the air &amp; every thing as pleasant as one could wish—(after most a week of rainy, 
                dark &amp; disagreeable but warmish weather)—I have the same old story to tell,—&amp; thankful enough to have nothing worse to communicate—it is probable I am 
                really slowly gaining—though I have occasional bad spells yet.

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter was received—I was thinking whether something could not be done 
                about getting the position of through baggage master—&amp; feel inclined to try for you—(You know there is nothing of that sort done without trying)—Did you get the story
