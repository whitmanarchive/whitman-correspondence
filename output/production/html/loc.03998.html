            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came &amp; I ought to have written to you before, but one thing &amp;
                another prevented. I was up to Germantown, to a friend's, where I have been a good
                deal lately,—Spent the Christmas &amp; New Year holidays there<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—they came for me, so I went &amp; was glad—a
                big house full of people, old &amp; young folks, &amp; plenty of fun &amp; every
                thing good—lots of oysters—&amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="cooked​ ">cook'd</span>​  so nice—I never knew how much there is in the cooking—Otherways I have been here in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Camden​ ">C.</span>​  all the time, have done a little work writing, but nothing much,—My
                brother from St Louis has been on here with us for a while—&amp; I have callers
                &amp; visitors quite often—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Ruth I got your letter—it was very acceptable—I will answer it

                looking boys—I was on my way to West Philadelphia to see about a Mr Anders, an
                elderly man sick with consumption. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Young</span> Mr Anders and I had
                got acquainted in Canada two years ago, &amp; quite attached to each other—he
                was a soldier there—I got a letter from him from Montreal day before
                yesterday, asking me to go to a certain number in West <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​  &amp; see his father,

                write to him how the father was particular—So I went up to-day—when I
                got there I found the elder A. was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">dead &amp; buried</span>—so
                I have just had to write the sad intelligence to my Canada friend<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>—love to you &amp; all</p>
