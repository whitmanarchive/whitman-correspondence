            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came &amp; I ought to have written to you before, but one thing &amp;
                another prevented. I was up to Germantown, to a friend's, where I have been a good
                deal lately,—Spent the Christmas &amp; New Year holidays there—they came for me, so I went &amp; was glad—a
                big house full of people, old &amp; young folks, &amp; plenty of fun &amp; every
                thing good—lots of oysters—&amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="cooked​ ">cook'd</span>​  so nice—I never knew how much there is in the cooking—Otherways I have been here in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Camden​ ">C.</span>​  all the time, have done a little work writing, but nothing much,—My
                brother from St Louis has been on here with us for a while—&amp; I have callers
                &amp; visitors quite often—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Ruth I got your letter—it was very acceptable—I will answer it
                    before long</p>

            <p class="tei_p">How are you all? I hope this will find you all well—little George is all right again I trust by this time—I met two
                jolly &amp; good-looking Jersey boys this afternoon over in Market Street,
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila.</span>​ —it was Elmer and Ed Stafford—we had a
                little talk—did me good to meet them—I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> think Jersey has two nicer
                looking boys—I was on my way to West Philadelphia to see about a Mr Anders, an
                elderly man sick with consumption. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Young</span> Mr Anders and I had
                got acquainted in Canada two years ago, &amp; quite attached to each other—he
                was a soldier there—I got a letter from him from Montreal day before
                yesterday, asking me to go to a certain number in West <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​  &amp; see his father,
                who had come on here some time ago quite sick—Young A. wanted me to see &amp;
                write to him how the father was particular—So I went up to-day—when I
                got there I found the elder A. was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">dead &amp; buried</span>—so
                I have just had to write the sad intelligence to my Canada friend—love to you &amp; all</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I have written a few
                lines to Harry</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I want to come down soon—Is the coast clear?</p>
