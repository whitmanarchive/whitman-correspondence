                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Nov</span>​  20, saying that you had been detained from home by illness but would soon

                anxious to know that you are still getting on towards recovering your health—I am very glad indeed that you have had such a "good time" in the west of the

            <p class="tei_p">I have now sent you a post office order for 21 shillings—This is for your

                Thompson—who lately became 21 years old. That is an
                occasion for rejoicing and congratulating people over here. I don't know why. I
                think people ought to be condoled with, rather. Anyhow, it is also the practice to
                cheer them up with presents—and, as I believed that your "Leaves of Grass"
                would give my cousin more pleasure than anything else I could give her, I gave her
                that book.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But her sister—another woman who is dear to me—Honora Thompson—had
                thought just the same and gave her the same book! So I have taken back "Leaves of

                copy to lend to those who know little about your poems and want to know more.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You say that you never received any thing from the publishers on account of that

                possible that it was a 'labour of love' on his part to bring the book out, and that he neither hoped for
                nor got any gain excepting the knowledge that he had done his best to make your works
                better known in England.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">That is how it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">seems</span> to me—I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> nothing.</p>

                selection of your poems in a popular form, so that all may gradually get knowledge
                of them. I who write to you am young (26) and inexperienced. I have lately abandoned

                Amongst other things, if it is not done before I can put my hand to it, I will, if
                you will give me leave, make and bring out a selection of your poems and sell it at
                a cheap price. People will not give 10 dollars—or 5—for that of which
                they know nothing. And thus you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">remain</span> an unknown writer
                to the great mass of Englishmen and Englishwomen. I hope that, come time, I shall
                write to you for your permission—At present, I cannot undertake this
                work—I want to have a more thorough knowledge—such knowledge as the
                digesting by time can alone give—of your poems, and I need not add that if it
                came in my path to come to America to see you, it is a chance which I should very eagerly grasp at.

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
