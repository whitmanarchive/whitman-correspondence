                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir</span></span>

            <p class="tei_p">In December I received from you a post-card, under date St Louis <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Misouri​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Missouri​
        
      </span></span>
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Nov</span>​  20, saying that you had been detained from home by illness but would soon
                return, when you would send to me the two books (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Vistas</span>
                &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Memoranda</span>) which I wrote to you
                for back in the fall. Since that I have not heard from you—this makes me rather
                anxious to know that you are still getting on towards recovering your health—I am very glad indeed that you have had such a "good time" in the west of the
                States, but it would be <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">sad</span> if you were to be ill for long as a consequence of your
                travel.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have now sent you a post office order for 21 shillings—This is for your
                second volume of the complete Edition of 1875 ("<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Two
                    Rivulets</span>") <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00358_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00358_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00358_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>I have a very dear cousin Ethel
                Thompson—who lately became 21 years old. That is an
                occasion for rejoicing and congratulating people over here. I don't know why. I
                think people ought to be condoled with, rather. Anyhow, it is also the practice to
                cheer them up with presents—and, as I believed that your "Leaves of Grass"
                would give my cousin more pleasure than anything else I could give her, I gave her
                that book.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But her sister—another woman who is dear to me—Honora Thompson—had
                thought just the same and gave her the same book! So I have taken back "Leaves of
                Grass" and am going to keep it as a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">loan copy</span>. That is a
                copy to lend to those who know little about your poems and want to know more.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And I am going to give to Ethel Thompson "Two Rivulets" so that she will be the
                gainer by <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nnk">two</span>

                to give her Whitman as a birthday present.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I want you, if you will, to write in the book "Ethel Thompson from Joseph William
                Thompson, December the 15<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span></span>
                1879" and, having written this, to sign it with your own name and the actual date of
                your so signing. Do you mind doing this for me and then sending it off by post
                to—
                Ethel Thompson
            Charles Thompson—esquire—

            <p class="tei_p"> I shall be very grateful to you, but not so grateful as I am for your having written
                what you have written
                (in your book, I mean).</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Honora Thompson tells me that she was not able satisfactorily to answer two questions
                which you put to her about the selection of your poems made by M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span> W. M. Rossetti, I can tell you. The book is out of
                print and the publishers—<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">Messrs</span> Chatto and Windus (of Piccadilly—

                definitely answer'd the question as to whether they were going to republish it in
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">negative</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You say that you never received any thing from the publishers on account of that
                selection. But do you think that a profit was made? From the manner in which M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span> Rossetti writes in the preface, I should think it very
                possible that it was a 'labour of love' on his part to bring the book out, and that he neither hoped for
                nor got any gain excepting the knowledge that he had done his best to make your works
                better known in England.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">That is how it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">seems</span> to me—I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> nothing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But many in England are anxious that there should be a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good</span>
                selection of your poems in a popular form, so that all may gradually get knowledge
                of them. I who write to you am young (26) and inexperienced. I have lately abandoned
                my intention—half-formed—of trying to earn my living at the
                bar—and I am <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00359_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00359_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00359_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>uncertain what work I shall do. But
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">some</span> work, some good to the world, I will try to do.
                Amongst other things, if it is not done before I can put my hand to it, I will, if
                you will give me leave, make and bring out a selection of your poems and sell it at
                a cheap price. People will not give 10 dollars—or 5—for that of which
                they know nothing. And thus you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">remain</span> an unknown writer
                to the great mass of Englishmen and Englishwomen. I hope that, come time, I shall
                write to you for your permission—At present, I cannot undertake this
                work—I want to have a more thorough knowledge—such knowledge as the
                digesting by time can alone give—of your poems, and I need not add that if it
                came in my path to come to America to see you, it is a chance which I should very eagerly grasp at. That <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00362_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00362_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00362_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>may possibly

            <p class="tei_p">Meanwhile, a M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span> Lewin of Birkenhead, who edits a small
                quarterly magazine called "Papers for the Times" seems to wish to reprint here the
                "Preface to Leaves of Grass" which you have omitted from all your later
                editions—May I ask you why you have omitted it? I know that you have
                practically embodied some of it in your other poems—but not all of it. I
                myself do not know whether your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">preface</span> is in reality a
                preface—something good to prefix—or itself a poem just as much as the
                other poems are. I have thought that that might be the reason for your no longer
                printing it as a preface. I have told M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span>
                Lewin that I would ask you as to your wishes with
                regard to it being reprinted.

                margin the other way—But if I, personally, had anything to do with the
                publishing, I should make it a condition that any profit that there might be should
                be handed over to you.</p>
