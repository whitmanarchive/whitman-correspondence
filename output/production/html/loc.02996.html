            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">With yr welcome card came to-night a letter fr. Gardner of Paisley,<a href="#n4318" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4318">1</a> accepting my MS. "Walt Whitman the Poet of Humanity." He is
                going to pub. in 2 vols. Is evidently enthusiastic. The poltroon, however,(!) wants me to cut
                out the censor's list of objectionable passages. I don't really know that they are
                essential,—guess
                I'd better let him. I suppose his idea is that people will buy L. of G. more if they
                are not given the passages in question in my book. He bites hard—says "it wd
                be a vast pity if the book were to fall through," owing to my obstinacy I suppose he
                means. I shall satisfy him. Have written him to leave those out.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I too have a terrific cold in head. Am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">deaf</span> in one ear
                temporarily, through sitting by open window (necessarily) where I work. But it is
                nothing. Wax in ear only.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are having house painted. Do hope you will get over that cold, dear Walt. Thank
                you for the news fr. O'C.<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">2</a> the Transcripts<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> are so thin I am ashamed to send 'em half the time. But it
                is little trouble, &amp; you can throw them on the floor when you get sick of em. Remembrances to
                    Traubel<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">4</a> &amp;c. It does one good to think of Dr. Bucke.<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">5</a>

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
