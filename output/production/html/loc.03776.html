                    for J. M. Bradstreet &amp; Son, had supervised the binding of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> (see Whitman's <a href="rut.00002">May 2, 1865</a>,
                    letter to Peter Eckler). Simpson wrote on <a href="loc.01924">May 10,
                        1867</a>, that he was going into business for himself and was interested
                    in publishing Whitman's next book: "Hearing you are writing another book [I]
                    would like to print and publish it for you and will give you better advantages
                    than any other publishing house . . . One of my reasons for securing your
                    friendship is my appreciation for you as a man, well knowing your life has been
                    devoted to help along those most in need of your assistance." On <a href="loc.01925">May 31, 1867</a>, Simpson informed Whitman that "we
                    have established a Ptng &amp; Publishing House." But, in his <a href="loc.01926">July 3, 1867</a>, letter, he advised Whitman that after
                    consultation "with several eminent literary men . . . though we are favorably
                    impressed, . . . we deem it injudicious to commit ourselves to its publication
                    at the present time." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n0819">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0819 note" id="n0819"><span>Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, a volume that consisted of fifty-three Civil War poems, was
                    published in 1865. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln occurred while <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> was being printed, and Whitman promptly added
                    the short poem "Hush'd be the Camps To-day," with a note about Lincoln's death
                    to the final signature of the book. Whitman then decided to stop the printing
                    and add a sequel to the book that would more fully take into account Lincoln's
                    death. Copies of the volume were withdrawn so that the sequel could be added.
                    Whitman hastily composed several poems, adding eighteen new poems to those that
                    appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, and all of these poems were
                    published in a second edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to Drum-Taps</span>
                    (1865–1866). Later, these poems were folded into <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves
                        of Grass</span>, and by the time the final arrangement of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was printed in 1881, the "Drum-Taps" cluster that
                    Whitman included in that volume contained forty-three poems. For more
