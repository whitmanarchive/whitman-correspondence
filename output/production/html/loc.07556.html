            <p class="tei_p">Probably the two or three letters lately from me have sketch'd in the
                situation—Last night middling fair—the bulk, say from 12 to 4½, I
                must have slept hardly disturb'd—wh' was doing well—rose
                    late—Ed comes in &amp; makes the fire—had a few
                mouthfuls of breakfast—very light—an hour later a bowel action pretty
                moderate—rather less irritation &amp; smartness &amp;c than previous
                days—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting now in my big chair by the fire more negatively comfortable than you w'd
                suppose—Sunny, rather windy, pretty sharp cold—Mrs. Harned &amp; the new born boy are getting along so far
                    splendidly—H. was here last evn'g—he has lost
                two cases (rather notable here)—two tavern keepers charged with selling liquor
                sunday—I keep on having applications for autographs, &amp; to read <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">MS</span> poems—have had five the last two days—cannot
                give any attention to them—generally dont read them thro—I have heard
                from Edw'd Carpenter—a young Englishman, a friend of
                his, has just call'd—C is well, &amp; occupied ab't the same as
                before—(rather wishes to come to America, &amp; the mate &amp; wife he has
                been living with wish the same for themselves.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">After 4</span>—have been lying on the bed an hour or
                so—Sitting here now alone—quiet &amp; cold &amp; near sunset—wind
                shakes the window sashes—here comes my dinner—</p>
