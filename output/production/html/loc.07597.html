            <p class="tei_p">I was profoundly touched, and greatly enriched and honored, by your unexpected gift.
                From every point of view, I don't see that anything of more worth could be added to
                the hoard of—1. An American, 2. A book-lover, 3. A devotee of the great, the
                broad, the original, the imaginative, in poetry and humane literature, 4. Of one whose
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00094_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00094_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00094_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_gt.00094_large.jpg</span>  
                good fortune it is to be your friend, your contemporary, your appreciative student and reader.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You have indeed done well, in thus bringing together, under one cover &amp; in this
                striking and unique shape, all your life-work<a href="#n4195" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4195">9</a>. There is no book just like this,
                &amp; there never will be. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">personal</span> note is
                everywhere. Moreover, as a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">book</span> merely, the most famous
                bibliophile—with the famous binders &amp; printers, &amp; a mine of wealth, to
                aid him—could not get up a volume so notable &amp; so sure of ever-growing
                value. This would be my notion of the volume, as

                begetter." Moreover, it impresses one as the result of a growth: of something not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">made</span>, off-hand, but the final outcome of a certain secular evolution.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">For the regard, the affection, which convoyed your noble argosy to this my
                haven,—believe me, my dear &amp; honored old Bard, they are returned to you
                four-fold.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">I have delayed this letter a few days, because it was in my mind to send you a
                return-gage: a more dimensional, but

                enriched by your own poetry and portrait)—which you
                will accept, I trust, &amp; which surely will seem of more significance to Walt
                Whitman than any other gift which <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> could send him. The
                succeeding volumes will reach you as they come from the press.—If you live to
                read them all,—well, I needn't wish you any

                &amp; me. It is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">America</span>. It is the symbolic, the
                essential, America from her infancy to the second Century of her grand Republic. It

                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
                    as correspondent of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York World</span> from 1860 to 1862.
                    In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
                    until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
                    next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
