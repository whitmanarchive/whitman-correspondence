            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">I was profoundly touched, and greatly enriched and honored, by your unexpected gift.
                From every point of view, I don't see that anything of more worth could be added to
                the hoard of—1. An American, 2. A book-lover, 3. A devotee of the great, the
                broad, the original, the imaginative, in poetry and humane literature, 4. Of one whose
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00094_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00094_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00094_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>  
                good fortune it is to be your friend, your contemporary, your appreciative student and reader.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You have indeed done well, in thus bringing together, under one cover &amp; in this
                striking and unique shape, all your life-work. There is no book just like this,
                &amp; there never will be. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">personal</span> note is
                everywhere. Moreover, as a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">book</span> merely, the most famous
                bibliophile—with the famous binders &amp; printers, &amp; a mine of wealth, to
                aid him—could not get up a volume so notable &amp; so sure of ever-growing
                value. This would be my notion of the volume, as
             <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00095_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00095_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00095_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
            a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">book</span>, if I knew nothing of its author—of its "only
                begetter." Moreover, it impresses one as the result of a growth: of something not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">made</span>, off-hand, but the final outcome of a certain secular evolution.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">For the regard, the affection, which convoyed your noble argosy to this my
                haven,—believe me, my dear &amp; honored old Bard, they are returned to you
                four-fold.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">I have delayed this letter a few days, because it was in my mind to send you a
                return-gage: a more dimensional, but

                will accept, I trust, &amp; which surely will seem of more significance to Walt
                Whitman than any other gift which <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> could send him. The
                succeeding volumes will reach you as they come from the press.—If you live to
                read them all,—well, I needn't wish you any

           estimate its significance, &amp; this quite irrespectively of its literary or
                artistic qualities. There are masterpieces in it. But it is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> a collection of masterpieces: it is something of more moment to you
                &amp; me. It is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">America</span>. It is the symbolic, the
                essential, America from her infancy to the second Century of her grand Republic. It

                years—as you went to &amp; fro, among the people, through the land &amp; under
                the canopy. In short, I send you an American "cosmorama" for your own room: hoping
                it may lighten some of the hours of your retirement there, &amp; that it may now

                readily obtain half-a-dozen counterparts, equally imaginative and noble, from your

                <p class="tei_p">If you ever write any one, by hand or proxy, it would be a great delight to hear
                    from you some time—&amp; I should specially like to know how the big "Library Amer. Lit"
                    strikes Walt Whitman—of all men the best judge of it. Pray give my kind
                    regards to M. Traubel.</p>
