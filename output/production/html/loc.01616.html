                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n0390">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0390 note" id="n0390"><span>On April 20, 1871, Chancellor of the Exchequer
                    Robert Lowe (1811–1892) proposed a tax on matches—a halfpenny on a
                    box of wooden matches and a full penny on waxed matches. For this proposal, Lowe
                    invoked the Latin phrase <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ex luce lucellum</span>: "Out of light,
                    a little profit." The proposal was met with protests and significant popular

                    Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was one of Whitman's
                    earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake:
                        A Critical Essay</span> (1868), Swinburne pointed out similarities between
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His
                    famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs
