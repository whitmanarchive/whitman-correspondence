                will be to look to the end of this letter endeavour

                it comes to pass that you hear from one—you will then I hope remember that some months 
                ago (in the Early part of December I think it was for I know Washington was busy with preparations 
                for the reopening of Congress) I came to see you in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr:</span>​

                there were a huge gulf between this and America at others again the thousands of miles of sounding 
                sea seems but as a very little space, &amp; I must say that since I have crossed this ferry &amp; 
                shaken hands upon the other side the distance seems as nothing &amp; the desire to return once 
                more gets stronger every day—I have been very, very much occupied &amp; intensely busy one

                &amp; yet so like to yours. Differences I think very great yet almost indistinguishable, certainly for

                Indeed until you come, you can hardly I think understand how many friends you have. I do not know that
