            <p class="tei_p">Public attention here, is largely directed toward the
                Buffalo Convention,<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">1</a> which meets to-day. This convention
                seems to be formed in utter defiance of all precedents and "party usages." Much of
                it is on a charming voluntary principle—I mean that of a man making himself a
                delegate, because so it seems good in his own sight. Any body, therefore, who wanted
                to go to Buffalo, (for $13 and 50 cents, which takes one all the way from New
                York, and back too,) has had his wish gratified, or else it was his own fault.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">That you may realize how politics are broken up here, just
                listen to the following remark made by the Chairman of the Whig<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a> General Committee of New York, to a distinguished
                Editor: "Sir," said the Chairman, "the proper Whig organization of the
                city—the Clay<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">3</a> Whigs—embody six thousand
                votes. We know them all—we know that they are, almost to a man, going for Van
                    Buren."<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> Now, this gentleman is a reliable authority,
                and has generally been supposed to know what he talks about. What do you think of
                it?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The principal beauty of our "Barnburner"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">5</a> friends, consists in their delightful, youthful, aspect
                of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">defiance</span>—quite picturesque and refreshing to one's
                tired consciousness of party obedience and "harmony." Nothing will please
                them—these don't-care-a-damnative young men. They reject advice, and insult
                even the senators and venerable editors who give it. They seem to glory in kicking
                up the most precious of rows—in rebelling against all the political etiquette
                of the last thirty years. Then the ease and complacency of the rascals—with
                what cool vanity they dare their elders and superiors in station, to do battle with
                them—either in argument or any other way. It is amazing!</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Amid all the wrangles of the politicians, however, a man
                may safely wrap himself up and take comfort in the fact, that the great
                self-interest of the people of the Republic never <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">can</span> let any
                imminent danger happen to our land. Besides, I am confident that more than a third
                of the Americans are not much interested in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">party</span>
                politics—but always hold the balance, and only turn it when the times
                demand.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Quite a startling case of attempted murder has just been
                coming off, over in Brooklyn, in one of the prettiest parts of that pretty city. In
                a long, undulating street, thickly shaded with large trees, and out of the way of
                clatter and the usual city noise—I speak of Johnson street—stands a
                little corner grocery, neater and cleaner than most shops of the kind. It was kept
                by a young German named Behms, and his wife.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> Last Sunday
                evening, another German, named Korth,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a> called upon Behms,
                and complained of being unwell. Mrs. B. wished him to partake of a cup of tea, which
                she said she would prepare for him. Korth, however, declined the tea, but asked for
                a glass of cool water. Behms then went out to get some from the pump; and while he
                was gone, Korth attempted to help himself to some money from the shop till. The
                woman, of course, remonstrated, and tried to prevent him. Korth inflicted wounds
                upon her, of which she has since been at the point of death. He continued to rummage
                the drawer and some other places, after a larger sum of money, $800, which Behms
                had mentioned the reception of, a day or two before. Not finding this, and hearing
                Behms returning, Korth went out the back door, and struck the husband down too;
                after which he took himself off, leaving the two for dead. Behms, however, called
                loudly, and the neighbors came. Mrs. B., upon medical examination, was given over,
                though she fully had her faculties, and her testimony was taken, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in extremis</span>; and
                the above narration is founded upon it. Up to this time, however, she is alive. The
                officers forthwith commenced a search for Korth, but he was not discovered nor
                arrested till the next morning, when he was taken at the foot of Courtland street,
                just as he was stepping on board one of the Albany boats.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had a real wonderful meeting, night before last, at
                Vauxhall Garden, in behalf of Irish repeal.<a href="#n1b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1b">8</a> Over twenty
                thousand persons were present; and, what was better, the contributions poured in
                liberally. We are daily expecting a formal protest against all this, from that
                "tight little isle" over the ocean.</p>
         
               <p class="tei_p">The omnibus war waxeth more and more furious—the
                proprietors<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">9</a> standing on their dignity, and the
                drivers standing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">out</span>. It is quite dreadful! Heaven only knows
                what will be the end of these things. It is well the regular army is now disengaged.
                I must give you a good toast, (it has been in some of the papers already,) delivered
                by one of the lunatics at the Utica Asylum, lately:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Van Buren will undoubtedly be nominated at Buffalo, in the
                course of to-day or to-morrow. You cannot possibly realize the ferocity of feeling
                that exists in this State at the present time, between the "Regulars" and the
                "Bolters." The disputes at the commencement of the present century between the
                Jeffersonians and the Federalists, were milk and honey to the present.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Those stories of <span class="itlalic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_itlalic">negroes</span> going to
                the Buffalo Convention, are nonsense. If any have gone, they were sent by the
                enemies of the Convention. Every effort is determinedly made by these "Free Soilers"
                to steer clear of the Abolitionists proper—a faction who have no respectable

                    is referring to the first National Free Soil Convention that
                    was held in Buffalo in August 1848. At the convention, attendees endorsed
                    Martin Van Buren (1782–1862) as the Free Soil presidential candidate
                    and nominated Charles F. Adams (1807–1886) for Vice President. Formed during the 1848 election, the Free Soil 
                    Party opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories of the western United States,
                    which included the territory that Mexico had ceded to the United States
                    in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War. When neither the 
                    Democratic nor the Whig party presidential nominees would rule out the expansion of slavery
                    into these territories, the Free Soil Party was formed in response. The Free Soil
                    Party was active for six years, from 1848 to 1854. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00961_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00961_n4"><span>The Whigs were a political
                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00954_n8 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00954_n8"><span>Henry Clay (1777–1852) was an attorney
                who went on to serve as a United States Representative and a United
                States Senator from Kentucky. Clay ran for president in the
                elections of 1824, 1832, and 1844, and, although he was unsuccesful in his 
                bids for the presidency, he was one of the founders of the Whig Party
                and of the National Republican Party. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n2"><span>A founder of the Democratic

                    States, serving from 1837 to 1841. Whig candidate William Henry Harrison
                    defeated the incumbant Van Buren in the 1840 election to become the ninth
                    president of the United States. Van Buren was also the Free Soil candidate for
                    president in the 1848 election; the Whig Candidate Zachary Taylor
                    (1784–1850) won the election and served as the twelfth president of the
                    United States, from 1849 until his death in 1850. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00950_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00950_n1"><span>Barnburners and Hunkers were terms used to describe 
                    opposing sides of the fracturing Democratic party in New York during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
                    reflected the national divisions that would lead to the American Civil War (1861–1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00965_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00965_n2"><span>Whitman is

                Behm (1815–1887). According to the 1855 United States

                  in a chair factory and in private homes as a house-servant and porter. 
                  Korth was convicted of two counts of assault with
                  the intent to kill John Behm (1815–1887) and his wife. Korth was sentenced to two consecutive prison terms,

                    the political and cultural forces pushing for an independent Ireland
                    in the 1840s. The Young Ireland movement was an Irish
                    nationalist movement that supported Irish independence. The movement
                    had its origins in the Repeal Association's campaign to dissolve 
                    the 1800 Irish Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland.
                    Young Irelanders seceded from the Repeal Association and formed
                    the Irish Confederation, garnering a strong base in
                    Dublin, and exerting a lasting influence on subsequent separatist endeavors.
                     Young Irelanders attempted an unsuccessful insurrection in 1848 with
                     the aims of Irish independence and democratic reform and 
                    as a response to British Parliament's passage of a "Crime and Outrage Bill"
                    that enacted martial law in Ireland in an attempt to counter Irish nationalism. 
                    The Young Irelanders' rebellion in July 1848, resulted in the arrest of the movement's leaders and the collapse 
                    of the rebellion efforts. Ireland would not become self-governing until 1922. </span></span> [<a href="#r1b">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00960_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00960_n4"><span>For an account of a meeting of the omnibus drivers—including

                a time of political rebellions and civil unrest across Europe. Most of the movements were dedicated to removing
                older monarchies and replacing them with independent nation-states. The revolutions took place in and/or affected France, 
                Italy, and the Netherlands, among other nations. A majority of the rebellions did not last long as they were quickly
                suppressed and ended by October 1849. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
