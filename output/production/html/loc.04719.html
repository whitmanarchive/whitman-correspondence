                A similar evening, but even calmer. The sun is just about setting behind a low
                thinly stratified bank of clouds. The rest of the sky is perfectly
                cloudless—grey purplish blue above, merging to palest salmon colour on the
                horizon. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01228_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01228_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01228_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.01228_large.jpg</span> The

                banks across the lake &amp; the opalescent colours of the Pike, broken here &amp;
                there by the rings left by leaping fish. (The furthest surface of the lake glazed
                later with ripples.) The glory with which the sun lately filled the whole scene has
                faded, &amp; a more subdued &amp; sober harmony has taken its place, deepening as
                the evening advances. The spirit of the whole is that of uttermost peace, content
                &amp; cheer. But the air is thick with the varied music of birds,—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01229_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01229_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01229_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.01229_large.jpg</span>not loud &amp;

                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, he kindly promised to come here for a short time
                today &amp; again tomorrow to do what he could.—I met him half an hour ago

                to give you sketches at once more varied &amp; more characteristic of the country
                here. But we can only do what we can, &amp; they will give you a kink or two into a

                    (1863–1929) was an English landscape artist. On <a href="loc.04720">June 19, 1891</a>, Wallace sent to Whitman four watercolor sketches of
                    Rivington by Cooper. In a postscript he wrote "If Traubel fancies any of them I
                    shall be glad to arrange with Cooper for a painting . . . I wanted to send T.
                    something &amp; can think of nothing better." This picture of the lakes at
                    Rivington, near Bolton, was commissioned by the members of the Bolton Whitman
                    Fellowship for presentation to Horace and Anne Traubel in 1892. Cooper, then
                    resident in Bolton, was a friend of the English physician Dr. John Johnston and
                    Wallace, and he later gained fame for his Lakeland paintings and book
                    illustrations. In 1948 Anne Traubel presented it to the Bolton Public Libraries
                    as being of special interest to the Bolton Whitman Fellowship. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
