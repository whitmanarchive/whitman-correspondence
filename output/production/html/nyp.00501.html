                    deterred by the remembrance of [Joseph L.] Gilder's unfriendly sport at me when

                    his governmental position because of "an uncircumcized dog," and was about to
                    establish a law practice in Boston, wrote to Whitman on <a href="yal.00293">September 22</a>: "I am still in the prime of life, have health, some
                    means and many friends, and if under these circumstances I did not cheerfully
                    accept the situation I should be unworthy ever to have read Leaves of Grass,
                    with its philosophy of hope and the morning." O'Connor, as indicated in his
                    letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.05149">September 22</a>, wanted Eldridge
                    to re-enter the publishing business, "so that we might start a magazine, and
                    make it pleasant for the bats and owls and literary carrion generally, but he
                    appears to have abandoned the idea" (Traubel, 4:191–192). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00501_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00501_n4"><span>On <a href="loc.01473">September 21</a> Burroughs invited Whitman to join him
