            <p class="tei_p">Dr Bucke's letters are extremely interesting but two paragraphs are of especial
                interest to us here The first is that "Horace" (? H. L. Traubel)
                is preparing a new book about you—"W W to date." Will you please kindly order
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">two</span> copies for me &amp; I will forward the cash when I
                know the price?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The second is that he (Dr B.) will probably be in England before so long &amp; will call 
                &amp; see "Johnston Wallace &amp; Co! (It sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> be W. J. &amp; Co!) This

                where he would receive a warmer welcome than in Bolton among "the boys." We are none
                of us wealthy but such as we have would be at his disposal during his stay among us.
                We have had many "Whitman evenings" but a "Whitman Evening" with Dr. Bucke in the
                    rostrum would be the climax of all 
                &amp; a life long remembrance. The thought of it is almost enough to take one's breath
                away—Let us hope it may not prove "too good to be true"!</p>

                of our intentions although his own wife was in the plot and had prepared a grand
