                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Whitman had asked both William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make
                    an abstract in English of it (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of <a href="loc.07567">January 22, 1889</a>, and to Bucke of <a href="loc.07572">January 27, 1889</a>). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
                    an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re</span>
                    (1893, pp. 159–94). Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935) was a translator
                    and poet from France, who commented positively not only on Whitman's work but
                    also on Poe's. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
                    in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
                    the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Whitman sometimes
                    misspells or is inconsistent in his spellings of the names of William Osler, his
                    doctor, and Hamlin Garland. He writes "Ostler" when he means "Osler" and refers
                    to Garland as "Harland." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
