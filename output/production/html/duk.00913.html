                a sort of curiosity to you—Mail it to Dr B[ucke] as he
                owns it &amp; wants it back—O'C[onnor] is still room-fast
                &amp; badly off—I am fearful of the worst luck (of wh' a long miserable
                helpless lingering condition is perhaps worst)—Sunny &amp; cold here—I
                am ab't as usual—a cold in the head—</p>
