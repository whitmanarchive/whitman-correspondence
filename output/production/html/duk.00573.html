                    the verso of George Washington Whitman's <a href="duk.00365">February 24,
                        1865</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. This letter is probably the
                    one that Edwin Haviland Miller dated to February 24?, 1865 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 1:376). Miller's date cannot be correct because Louisa's letter
                    apologizes for not sending George's letter earlier. The letter from George was
                    originally sent to Boston, and Walt remained unaware that his brother had been
                    exchanged at least through February 27, 1865. Louisa did not forward the letter
                    earlier because she assumed Walt already knew of George's release. According to
                    Louisa's <a href="duk.00435">March 5, 1865</a> letter to Walt, she
                    forwarded George's letter (this one) "yesterday." Therefore, this letter dates
                    to March 4, 1865. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00573_n6 note" id="duk.00573_n6"><span>Walt Whitman remained

                    William Cook, in which he inquired why George had not "come up with the main
                    body, for exchange." The delay between George's sending the letter and Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman's forwarding it to Walt was related to two matters: that
                    George's letter was "missent to boston" and that George's name appeared in the

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
                    death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_225.html">Whitman, Martha
