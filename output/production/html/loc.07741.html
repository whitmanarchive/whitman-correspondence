                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry
                    and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
                    known. See Andrew C. Higgins, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    even attempt to tell yourself (upon this page of paper with this pen in my
                    hand), what it is that makes me ask you now to bless me. . . . Perhaps we shall
                    yet meet [after death]: . . . I shall ask you about things which have perplexed
                    me here—to which I think you alone could have given me an acceptable
                    answer. . . . I cannot find words better fitted to express the penetrative fate

                    will not disapprove of my conduct in the last resort." What Whitman failed to
                    see was that Symonds, who was preoccupied with his study of sexual inversion,
                    was trying to ask the questions he finally posed nine months later. See
                    Whitman's <a href="loc.02142">August 19, 1890</a>, letter to

                    Harleigh Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey, on March 30, 1892, four days after his
                    death, in an elaborate granite tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of
                    Philadelphia built the tomb, at a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion
                    of these costs with money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet
                    could purchase a summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's
