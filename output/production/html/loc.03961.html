            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thinking of you and wondering how your Christmas was spent has tempted me to write a
                few lines to you to-night. We all spent that day very happily with Debbie, New Years day we expect them to spend with us. How nice it
                would be if you could join us. I don't know whether any of the folks at home will be
                able to come over or not. Van or Ed may
                come but Pap does not go out a great deal since his illness. He does not improve as
                rapidly as we would<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00094.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00094.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00094.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> like
                to have him. Mother was pretty well for her when we were home last.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well excepting the baby who has quite a severe cold at present.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We do not expect to remain here another year. Harry has made
                application to the R. R. Co, but has not received much encouragement yet. I suppose
                you have heard of Mont's removal to Elwood N. J. He is quite
                well pleased with his new home.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Please accept my thanks for the $2 which you sent the children.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope this letter will find you in good health and spirits. With best wishes and
                love from us all I say good night.</p>
