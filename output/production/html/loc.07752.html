                &amp; bread for breakfast—good bowel action—Shall probably have a poemet
                (8 or 9 lines) in Feb. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>—Shall send it you in slip, soon as out—Stead has
                sent me his "Review of Reviews" f'm London—shall I
                send it to you? Horace has it now—</p>

                exhilaration—no massage or wheel-chair to day—my nurse has disappear'd for the day—now 3½
                oclock—If I had a good hospital, well conducted—some good nurse—to
                retreat to for good I sometimes think it w'd be best for me—I shall probably
                get worse, &amp; may linger along yet some time—of course I know that death
                has struck me &amp; it is only a matter of time, but may be quite a time
                yet—But I must get off this line—don't know why I got on it—but
                having written I will let it remain—enclosed (I
                have just come across it &amp; I tho't I w'd send it to you) is Sylvanus Baxter's
                Pension Proposition two years ago—Peremptorily declined by me—but for
                all that &amp; against my own decision put before the U S H[ouse of]

                passed, (did I send you the U S H R Committee report?)—but not definitively pass'd by Congress—Perhaps I had better tell
                you, dear Maurice, that the money or income question is the one that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">least</span> bothers me—I have enough to last. This is a sort
