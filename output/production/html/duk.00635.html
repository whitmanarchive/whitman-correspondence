                    Richard Maurice Bucke, on an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent
                    Collection (not reproduced here), dated this letter mid-December 1868. Edwin
                    Haviland Miller assigned the date December 14? (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:366). Based on the letter's reference to the death of DeWitt
                    C. Enos, a Brooklyn physician, which the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily
                        Eagle</span> reported on December 15, the date range for the letter can be
                    narrowed to a range shortly after Enos's death, though probably not as early as
                    that proposed by Miller. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman tended to share Brooklyn news
                    with Walt Whitman promptly, so it is unlikely that the letter dates to more than
                    three or four days after the December 15 report of Enos's death. Randall H.
                    Waldron also assigned "mid-December" as the date for the departure of Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman and family to St. Louis, though Waldron's date may rely in
                    part on Miller's date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell

                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For

                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a

                    complains, but her complaint has an element of bitter humor that would have been
                    recognizable to her son Walt Whitman. The $100 amount is an echo of Mattie
                    Whitman's complaint from a little over a month earlier: Jeff Whitman's check
                    from the Metropolitan Board of Health was $100 short of the amount that
                    Mattie had anticipated (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00554">November 4?,
                        1868</a> letter to Walt). Even if one finds sardonic humor in Louisa's
                    echo of the amount that frustrated Mattie, her complaint over Jeff and Mattie's
                    spendthrift ways reflects her recognition that she lived in comparative poverty.
                    From her perspective, Jeff's earnings at the St. Louis Water Works were beyond
                    comprehension: "mr lane told george they had raised Jeffs salary to 6000 but i
                    think it must be a mistake" (see her <a href="duk.00543">May 5, 1868</a>

                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
