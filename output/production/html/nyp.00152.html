                    soldier in Co B 17th Pennsylvania Cavlary, was brought to Armory Square Hospital
                    with typhoid fever. Eventually Brooks recovered and, after a furlough, returned
                    to his regiment (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public
                    Library). Whitman's reply of December 19 is lost (Charles I. Glicksberg, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and the Civil War</span> [Philadelphia University
                    of Pennsylvania Press, 1933], 140). Whitman noted the case in his diary (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and the Civil War</span> [1933],
                    149â€“150). </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
