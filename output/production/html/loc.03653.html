                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">recd</span>​  your postal handshake, 
                and am glad to find that you appreciate my motives in writing to the English public on your behalf. 
                Whatever comes of the appeal, nothing but good to you can come from this increased knowledge of you among
                general readers here; and that your apotheosis is at hand is <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">abt</span>​ 
                as certain as that the sun shines and that great <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_me">sun</span>
                lives for ever. Every day widens your circle; every year sows your great seed deeper &amp; deeper in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You will have already have heard from William Rossetti how he has 
                striven on your behalf. My second letter naturally turned the tide of contributions in his direction, as I desired, 
                deeming him your very good friend, as indeed he seems to be. I am sending out, however, some £25 
                (particulars in other letter), including £5 from Tennyson, which came to me before 
                I could answer Rossetti's letter. Since then Moncure Conway has denied authoritatively
                that you wanted money, &amp; I have been
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03653.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03653.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03653.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                waiting &amp; wondering what to do. From your letters (which Rossetti has sent me for perusal) I pretty well 
                perceive how matters stand, &amp; how, though not in actual pinching 
                want, you really need and ought to have more money. Owing to the contradictions afloat, I have delayed putting 
                your case before <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">personal friends</span>, &amp; the few pounds I send are simply 
               stray tokens from the general public.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">You must forgive me for my blunder <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">abt</span>​  the price of your books. 
                The result proves that very many people who admire you here <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">cant​ </span><span class="tei_corr">can't​
        
      </span></span>
                afford such a high price as 2 guineas, &amp; you will therefore have to be content with a smaller circle of subscribers than you would otherwise get.</p>    
            <p class="tei_p">What I want you to tell me forthwith is how far the sum already gathered between Rossetti &amp; myself—say 
                £50 or so in all—will go to make you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">temporarily</span> comfortable? There will 
                doubtless be a heavy deduction in the cost of buying out your Beautiful Edition. But query, will the                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03653.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03653.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03653.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                sum already gathered keep you going tolerably while other subscriptions are "dribbling" in? I wish I were a 
                rich man—I am only an author living by his pen—and you should certainly never want anything your 
                heart craved; but all I can do in my small way is to sing your praises wherever I can. (By the way, I enclose 
                you a portion of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Gentleman's Magazine</span>, with another letter of mine).</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">I can conceive you smiling superbly as you survey the gnats of American journalism 
                now <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_cb">hovering</span> round your head. Thanks for your papers. 
                When people become abusive, they have been touched to the quick, &amp; I am sure the commotion will do you good.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">It is with true grief that I read of your sorry health. Will you believe it, I had never heard of your condition 
                until I read these quotations from the New Jersey Paper? Had I known of it sooner, you would certainly have 
                heard from me—or even seen me—long ago. A year or two ago I had some correspondence with 
                E. C. Stedman concerning you; and as far as I can gather, he           
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03653.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03653.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03653.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                is most hostile to your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">poetic</span> claims. I found argument in vain, &amp; desisted. Stedman 
                is a clever versewriter, without backbone or vice; &amp; there are many like him here &amp; even with you; but believe 
                me, such men do not truly represent even the average intelligence of students, and your circle of readers is in the 
                empyrean above their heads.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is now a daily dream with me to see you &amp; know you, for ever so short a time, in the flesh. Whether or not 
                that honour &amp; delight will be granted me, I shall never think of you but with love and honour, never speak or 
                write of you without homage. Be happy, Whitman, in the serene certainty that you have fulfilled your life, &amp; 
                spoken—in tones no thunder can silence—the beautiful message you were fashioned to bring!</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

                <p class="tei_p">Write to me as soon as convenient, &amp; let me know, in strictest &amp; deepest confidence, exactly 
                    how far the present "little" will help you, &amp; what will make you comfortable for the future—</p>
