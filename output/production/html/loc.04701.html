            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was extremely pleased yesterday morning to receive your post card of the 10<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst., with its cheerful
                account of yourself and its loving benediction. Thank you from my heart.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How much I feel your kindness I cannot fully tell you. But if, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01108.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01108.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01108.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> (as you say) you "sent out 'Leaves of
                Grass' to arouse, &amp; set flowing, endless streams of living, pulsating love &amp;
                friendship, directly from us to yourself, now &amp; ever."—you have still
                further done so, in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">our</span> fortunate experience, by your
                continued loving-kindnesses &amp; affectionate words. Thanks, and again
                thanks, &amp; God bless you.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">To your "terrible, irrepressible yearning—your <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01109.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01109.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01109.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> never-satisfied appetite for
                sympathy"—alas! we can only partially respond, (for what are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">we</span>?) but our heart's best love is yours, and a reverence
                &amp; gratitude such as we feel towards no one else.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are deeply sorry to learn that you have been so unwell of late. We hoped that the
                improved condition of your health reported to us at Christmastide had
                continued,—until we were alarmed by a newspaper <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01110.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01110.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01110.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> paragraph which seemed to shew that you had had a bad relapse. It is reassuring now to learn that it has
                not been so bad as we feared, &amp; that you "might be much worse."—&amp; we
                hope to hear better news before long.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The other night I picked up a little book at the Railway bookstall, which I have been
                looking over tonight. It is called: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">In Darkest London</span>"

                Salvation Army captain engaged in the East end. It gives a very painful &amp;
                realistic account of the horrible misery, destitution &amp; vice prevailing, &amp;
                of the noble self-sacrificing effects of men &amp; women, (Agnostics, Salvationists
                &amp;c) who, with love &amp; pity, do what they can to lessen its misery. The hero
                of the story breaks down in health, &amp; is ordered into Kent, where he visits a

            <p class="tei_p">To find your name in such a story was like seeing a beam of light in a dark place.
                And I was glad to think of, &amp; to read once more, your "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Song
                    of the Universal</span>," &amp; to be cheered by its "quenchless faith."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Last night I called to enquire about a young girl, (18), who is slowly dying. It
                stirred me to hear the accounts of her:—"a triumph of patience. When she is
                the better side out she is always singing. (Can scarcely hear her speak but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sings</span> pretty clearly)—and when in pain
                praising."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"Out of the mouths of babes &amp; sucklings Thou hast ordained strength," and things

                &amp; prudent" are "revealed to babes." Surely this is
                the victory that overcomes the world—a victory we should all share—the
                glad soul recognizing tender love &amp; care &amp; grounds for hope—in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> the circumstances of life &amp; death.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot write any more now. But with best love always</p>
