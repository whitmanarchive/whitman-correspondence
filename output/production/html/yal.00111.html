            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 13th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ . About the plate my impression still is that in the hands of a good expert
                steel plate printer it will be found to be not only not worn, but just about as good
                as new. There have been less than 2000 impressions struck off from it altogether,
                &amp; it has been carefully preserved. However let us say $40 (instead of 50)
                as the price (with the books &amp; prints before specified).</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My notion is against getting up any further portrait (this steel plate will have to
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">permanently</span> continue in all issues) for this issue, or
                at present—let that be kept for something to give
                added zest to a future issue—perhaps a year or two from now. Besides we would
                have to hurry too much—for I think the book better be thrown on the market
                forthwith—all the favorable stars are apparently just now in
                conjunction—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The press-work (which I hope will be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very carefully
                    done</span>, &amp; with good ink)—&amp; the binding, color, style, (strong,
                plain, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">unexpensive​ </span><span class="tei_corr">inexpensive​
        
      </span></span>, is my notion, nothing fancy) are now about to be prepared for
                immediately, &amp; the plate printing to be at once put in hand. The book will not
                make more than 390 pages (most likely 385 to 390.)—I am in favor of its being so
                trimmed &amp; bound that it will be as eligible as possible for the pocket, &amp; to
                be carried about—&amp; I am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> in favor of wide
                margins.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have no objection for any specific time for the contract to continue if you wish. I
                think of calling Friday noon 16th at your place—</p>
