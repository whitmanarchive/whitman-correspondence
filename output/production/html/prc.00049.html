            <p class="tei_p">Lou wishes me to write you a line. She is very weak yet, but . . . in good spirits and comparatively free from pain, for now five days and nights. The babe ceased to live before it was delivered. That Lou's life was saved and that she will recover (as now seems every way probable) is something to be devoutly thankful for. The case is curiously solemn and sad—to me—Everyone says it was the most beautiful, perfect, and well-developed babe, boy; unusually large, had black hair, nose and features like its father. Today is the anniversary of little Walter's death here. Emmy, isn't it a sad world, after all.</p>
