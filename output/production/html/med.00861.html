                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was a translator and poet from France who commented positively not only on
                    Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
                    apparently liked the critic's work on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of

                    as the "big book," was published by the poet himself—in an arrangement
                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span>—in December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made
                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
                    the staff of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Nation</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Magazine</span> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
                    editor-in-chief of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic Monthly</span> from 1871 to
                    1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
                    support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
                    Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
                    Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
                    Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
                    Ashtabula <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel </span>review of the 1860 edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
                    distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
                    hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
                    whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
                    review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Round
                        Table</span>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
                    Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Susan Goodman and Carl Dawson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</span> (Berkeley:
