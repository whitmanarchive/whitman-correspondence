            <p class="tei_p">Your letter and the translation have come and I thank you markedly. I have sent M.
                Sarrazin (his piece is a great steady trade-wind hurrying the ship into port) a copy
                of the big book. . . . Dr. Bucke makes a little fun of Howells's notice of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: Boughs</span> in Feb. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's</span> (the
                wonder is that it is so friendly and good). . . . I sit up all day and read and
                write (tho' both are getting almost loathsome), and keep fair spirits upon the
                whole.</p>
