                    came to hand last evening—Was glad to have the latter—in fact am always glad
                    to get anything on that subject. So the mess
                    work on the "Dinner Book" is done—that being so
                    Horace ought to have sent me a copy without waiting for the binding—he
                    promised to do that and I am disappointed
                    he did not. Tell him if he has not mailed a copy to please to
                    do so right away. If you or H. have a spare copy of that "New England Monthly" please send it me. Want to
                    see what the magazine looks like. I am real glad to hear that H. 
                    will write on you in it he ought (and I guess will) get up
                    a first-class paper. He ought to know

                    No, I was not much interested in the Pan-American business
                    though it is worth interest—do not see why Canada is not represented—she ought to be. It will
                    all come right in the end only it takes time.—Good heavens! What a group of nationalities there will be
                    in the Americas some day. Shall you and I see the show, standing together perhaps on Alcyone?

                    By that time you will be feeling better but I wish you could be a little more comfortable meanwhile
