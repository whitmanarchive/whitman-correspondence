            <p class="tei_p">Am getting along fairly I guess considering. Dr Longaker,
                of 652 north 8th St. Phila. has been here &amp; we have had a good long
                comprehensive talk—he too thinks the use of the catheter unquestionably
                advisable—&amp; I have used it for the first time—He has given a
                prescription for the terrible bowel obstinacy (pills) &amp; I have just sent off to
                the druggist's for it—the proofs of the poetic part for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye</span> are sent back &amp; the plates of them (18 or 20 pages) will
                probably be cast to-day—(are likely cast now)—then they will set up the
                prose pages—y'r letter rec'd last evn'g—I
                receive frequent &amp; loyal &amp; affectionate letters f'm the Bolton, Eng.
                friends—one to-day—Horace is going off soon to N Y. to hear Ingersoll orate on <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Shakspere​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Shakespeare​
        
      </span></span>—will be a great treat—Harrison S Morris was here, telling me of Stedman's
                "Poetry" lectures at Johns Hopkins—S. spoke of me &amp; L of G. several times
                &amp; in favorable tone—there are to be more lectures.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">Tom Harned here last evn'g—full of business—a roast
                apple for my breakfast—am reading "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Holland</span>, its Places
                &amp; People" trans. f'm the Italian of Amicus—What a people they have been and are! "The pills have come" f'm the
                druggist's &amp; I have just taken one (take every three hours)—Have you the
                Round-Table pamphlet 52 pp: 
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span>—Edinburgh? If not I can mail it to you—As I
                close it is ab't 3 &amp; I am feeling in fair mood—dark &amp; damp out, mild,
                looks like more strom— very uneasy ab't my sister at
                Burlington Vermont—She is sick &amp; old &amp; nervous &amp; in a bad
                way—my niece Jessie (Jeff's
                daughter) at St Louis is getting along fairly—my brother Ed is still at the Blackwood institution (we pay $3½ a week) all
                satisfactory—</p>
