            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have read thy sublime poem of the "Universal" once and again, 
                and yet again—seeing it in the 
                Graphic, Post, Mail, World, and 
                among other papers.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>It <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span> 
                sublime.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>It raised my mind to its own sublimity.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>It 
                seems to me the sublimest of all your poems.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>I cannot help reading it every once 
                of a while.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>I return to it as a fountain of joy</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My beloved Walt.—You know how I have worshipped you, without change or cessation, for twenty 
                years.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>While my soul exists, the worship must be ever new.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition
                of the "Leaves of Grass" that I saw a copy 
                of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that 
                here was something that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown around 
                me, and grown into me</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I expected certainly to go down to Camden last fall to see you.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>But something 
                prevented. And, in time, I saw in the papers that you had recovered—The New Year took 
                me into a new field of action among the miserables.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>Oh, what 
                scenes of human horror were to be found in this city last winter.—I cannot tell you how much I was
                engaged, or all I did for three months.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>I 
                must wait till I see you to tell you about these things.<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>I have

            <p class="tei_p">How absurd it is to suppose that there is any ailment in the brain of a man who can generate the poem of the 
                "Universal"<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>I would parody Lincoln 
                and say that such kind of ailment ought to spread.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My beloved Walt—Tell me if you would like me to come to see you, and perhaps I can do so within a few weeks.</p>
