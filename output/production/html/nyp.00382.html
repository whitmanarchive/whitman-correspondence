                        Doyle, | M st. South bet 4½ &amp; 6th | Washington D. C." It is postmarked:
                        "Camden | (?) | (?) 9 | N.J.; Carrier | 30 | Dec | 8 AM."</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This postcard cannot be assigned to a specific year because the allusions to
                        Whitman's health are vague and in fact applicable to almost any time between
                        1873 and 1876, and there are no concrete references to events which would
                        make dating possible. However, it was written on a standard government
                        postcard which was redesigned in 1876.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
