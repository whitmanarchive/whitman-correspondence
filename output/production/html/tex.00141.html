         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> have been setting at the foot of what I call my bed idoly speculating,  on the past, and thinking of many men I have met and called them Friends how often the word Friend, is missplace, but you have told me you were my Friend and called me your young Friend, I thank you for that priveledge from the inmost recess of my heart as I know you can appreciate a sincere Friend, and I will try to be that to you. I gave Father one of your ambrotypes when I was at home, he was very much pleased with it, and reconised it at once. My little Wife exclaimes, he looks like a very inteligent and kind hearted Old Gentleman,
 when I gave her the presents you sent her, she said tell him Andy when you see him that although his gifts are small and he is an entire stranger to me I appreciate them very much, as you say he is a warm and good Friend of yours I respect all of your sincere and good Friends, Walt, I stopped at your residence when passing through Washington enroute to join my Regiment, and was told that you had gone on a visit to the Army, thinking that you had thought, that I had neglected to call upon you as I promised, I thought you might have gone out to visit me at my camp, expecting to meet you there I was sorrowfully disapointed on my arrival there to find that my conjectures were without foundation. Walt, I would invite you to visite me here at Camp but I am told that I will be sent home in a few days with the reenlisted men, to remain there for the term of Thirtyfive days, if it proves to be the truth I will stop and try to persuade you to go on to New York with me, and visit my little Wife and my home, to enjoy a few of your leisure hours cheerfully. I will now conclude Walt, as it is quite late, asking you to please excuse this scratch, as I have a very sharp pointed pen and my ink is frozen. I will now bid adieu,</p>
