        &amp; plenty of them (the very reverse of my valued Dr Drinkard)—&amp; 
        yet I value what <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">he</span> says &amp; does for me—He is inclined to think the seat of all my woe has been (what no one ever whispered before,) the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">liver</span>, 
        acted upon largely also, perhaps almost primarily, thro[ugh] the emotional nature—at any rate he is decided 
        that the present botherations are absolutely <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">liver</span> troubles, &amp; their radiations—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, I have had a sick, sick three weeks since you were here—havn't been out, except just 
        in front of the house in the sun, &amp; only three times that—but don't be alarmed, my dear friend—the probabilities are, (in my opinion any how,) that I shall get partially well yet—</p>
