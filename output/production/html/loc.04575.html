            <p class="tei_p">For the last two weeks I have been expecting to hear from you every day, and I did hope to have seen you before this time.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> A week ago I supposed that you had gone East but as I have not received a copy of "Leaves of Grass" from you I now begin to think that perhaps you have not got on as well as you expected and that you are still ill in St Louis.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">If this is the case it may be that you are short of money—if you are and will let me I will gladly send you a hundred dollars.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> This you may look upon as a loan (to be paid by ten copies of "Leaves of Grass"), or a gift, or (more justly) as a small instalment of the infinitely greater debt than that which I owe you. In any case, look at it as you please, I hope you will not refuse to take the money if you have any <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_damage tei_gap_extent_1 tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_quantity_12 tei_gap_unit_chars">[damage]</span> need of it at all.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Could I be of any use to you there I will ask at once for a weeks leave of absence (which I know I can get) and go at once to St Louis</p>
