        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I write this lying in bed yet—but I sit up several times during the day now, for a
        few minutes at a time—am gradually gaining the use of my left arm &amp; leg—(the
        right side has not been affected at all)—think I shall be able to move round a little
        by Sunday—The Doctor has just been—he says I am doing very well—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">John Burroughs is here temporarily—he comes in
          often—Eldridge and Peter Doyle are regular still, helping &amp;
        lifting &amp; nursing me—but I feel now that I shall soon be able to help
        myself—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I slept quite well last night—It has been very cold indeed here, they say—but I
        have not felt it—as I write, it looks pleasant &amp; bright, the sun shining in real
        cheerful—I see by Sister Lou's letter that you had no news from St. Louis—poor,
        poor Mat, I think about her often, as I am lying here—I have not written to Han since
        I had the paralysis—Mother, you might send one of my letters to her, Han, when you next write—(this one, or any)—Say I sent my love,
        &amp; will be up before long—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, &amp; Sister Lou &amp; Brother George, I will close for the present, for this week—Will write
        Sunday—but I understand the mails are a little irregular this weather—</p>
