                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> Many times during the past four or five weeks I have thought of your cordial
                invitation to me to write to you, but I have waited until I have got settled into my
                new mode of life before availing myself of the pleasure. Since I saw you I have
                spent nearly a fortnight at Mt. Desert— an island which in small space combines
                every variety of scenery—ocean and cliffs, mountain and lake, forest and
                beach— an <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00574_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00574_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00574_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> epitome
                of what those who love beautiful landscape (and seascape) prize most. I wished, as
                I stood on the top of Green Mountain, the highest point on the island, and looked
                down upon a view of indescribable beauty &amp; variety that I could by some magic
                have brought it all before your eyes, because I suspected that in Camden you would
                have given much for such a sight and also for many a long breath of the fresh brisk
                breeze. I can't describe to you the mysterious fascination the ocean has for me, or
                how <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00575_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00575_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00575_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I was stirred
                and pleased to hear once more the tone from his "husky-haughty lips"— those
                ceaseless chatterers and orators. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> As you are probably aware Bar Harbor, the chief place on Mt. Desert, has become a
                fashionable resort. A few years ago the natives, (like most of the Maine folk, dull,
                cloddish creatures) passed from season to season in unbroken monotony, content to
                grab a few vegetables from ill-tilled, rocky, soil and to live on smoked fish. Not so
                long before them the Indians themselves built their wigwams and hunted game in the
                forests. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Now, you meet the rich <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ss tei_unclear_cert_high">idlers</span>
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00576_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00576_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00576_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> from Boston, New
                York, Chicago and other cities, during their gorgeous turn-outs along well-kept roads. French cooks
                poke their white caps from the kitchen windows of costly villas, and French millinery adorns
                fashionable ladies. In the season—that is during part of July and the whole of
                August—big hotels are crammed with thousands of visitors, and social
                extravagance reaches so high a level as in Fifth Avenue in winter. Of all this I saw
                but little, because most of the gay people had left, but I could not help
                contrasting the unsatisfying <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00577_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00577_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00577_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> showiness and gilded insincerity of some of the drawing rooms I
                visited, with the homelike simplicity and comfort of your little parlor, where I
                found "plain living and high thinking" embodied. For that privilege I shall long be
                grateful. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Well, I came back from Mt. Desert feeling much better in body and spirits, having
                exchanged some of the heaviness and weariness contracted in Philadelphia for the
                beneficient effects wrought by crisp air, blue skies, endlessly fascinating play of
                color and shadows in sea and slopes, and old ocean's tranquilizing drone. Without
                much trouble I found a sunny room in Cambridge <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00578_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00578_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00578_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and having at last got my books
                within reach I begin to feel at home. It is pleasant to be my own master again, and
                to be able, for the present at least, to follow my inclinations. If I am reading I need not hurry
                to reach the office, or submit to other interruption; if I wish to walk, the day and
                the night, and roads leading in all directions, are mine. Occasionally comes the
                desire of writing but the proper moment has not yet accompanied it, and I do not
                force myself, suspecting that as I gradually outline the strain upon mind and body
                which nearly four years of <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00579_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00579_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00579_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> constant journalistic drudgery caused, the impulse to write will
                need no coaxing. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I attend several courses at the University, chiefly upon historical subjects. Good
                fortune for me has been James Russell Lowell's consent to conduct a course dealing
                with Dante and Cervantes. I have as yet met him but once, but then I was charmed by
                him. You won't detect pedant or such about him, but a splendid example of a
                cultivated American, who knows the best that other lands and times have to offer,
                but who is still American. I look forward to a closer acquaintance with him.
                Certainly, it will be impossible to meet such a man <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00580_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00580_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00580_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> frequently without getting much
                good. I find it of inestimable value to see in operation traits and principles over
                which men theorize interminably. Better, one example of nobility than fifty recipes
                for it. And so, in Mr. Lowell, one has a remarkable pattern of the man of broad
                culture. When I remember that he dared to lift his voice against slavery years ago,
                when to do so was dangerous to one's body and particularly difficult for those who
                belonged to the social circle in which he and Wendell Phillips were brought
                up—when I remember this, and witness the well-deserved honor of his later
                years, I think he must stand among <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00581_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00581_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00581_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the few thoroughly fortunate poets
                who have received during their lifetime what usually is bestowed upon poets' memory.
                Of course you are familiar with Lowell's "Commemoration Ode"—a poem, it seems
                to me—in which the best Americanism gets itself uttered in memorable fashion. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I was very glad to receive several weeks ago an account of the horse and phaeton. I
                am sorry that I knew nothing of the surprise beforehand so that I might have had the
                pleasure of being among those who planned the gift. I hope you are able to drive
                every day, and that from your new point of view you will make some observation that
                you will share with your <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00582_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00582_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00582_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> friends. Do you discover a different aspect in nature and men now
                that you look down upon them from the seat of your vehicle? I earnestly wish that
                this new possession may bring you much pleasure and improve your health. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have given the newspapers so little attention during the past month—merely
                glancing at its telegraphic news from day to day—that I haven't seen anything
                that might interest you, which you have not also seen; but I shall soon be more
                regular in skimming the English &amp; American weeklies, and I will send you
                whatever I deem <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00583_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00583_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00583_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                you would care to have. I am reading—among a dozen books—Lewes's "Life
                of Goethe," bright, easy and entertaining. Like everything that pertains to Goethe
                this account of him has an especial charm for me.—But I must stop, first,
                because you may find my garrulity tedious, and second, because the clocks have
                tolled midnight. </p>
