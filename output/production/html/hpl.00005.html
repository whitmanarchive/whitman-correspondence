                Thompson's," on the Delaware river edge, to a nice
                dinner, baked shad &amp; champagne <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">galore</span>—jolly
                company—enjoy'd all with moderation—No, the
                Mr Smith, my liberal &amp; faithful Quaker friend, is R Pearsall Smith (glass manufacturer &amp; man of wealth) father of Mrs.
                    Costelloe, my staunchest living woman
                friend—the Librarian Logan Smith, (now dead) was
                his brother—Did you see the N. Y. Eve. Sun of 15th Ap[ril]?</p>
