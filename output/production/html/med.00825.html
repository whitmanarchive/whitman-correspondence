            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">In admiration of some of your poems, which I read in an edition, ridiculously
                "expurgated," published by Chatto &amp; Windus, in London, I feel constrained to
                have the Parisian people share the estimation in which I hold your high lyrical
                talent.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Would it be too much to ask of you that you indicate the volume (the edition) which
                you would prefer having rendered in the French? My friend, Jules Laforgue (who died
                only too prematurely) has already given to the public two of your poems, and the
                reception they met with seems to presage a new victory for your works.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In expectation of your kind reply, Sir and dear poet, permit me to assure you of my sympathy in art and of my profound admiration.</p>
