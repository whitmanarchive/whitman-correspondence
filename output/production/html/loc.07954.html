                    was a close acquaintance of Walt Whitman and one of the poet's literary
                    executors. He met Whitman in 1873 and proceeded to visit the aging author almost
                    daily beginning in the late 1880s. The result of these meetings—during which
                    Traubel took meticulous notes—is the nine-volume collection <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/index.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span>. Later in life, Traubel also
