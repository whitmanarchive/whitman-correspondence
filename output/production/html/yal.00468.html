                    in a notebook at Yale with the following also in Whitman's hand: "Sir | Feeling
                    that I am competent &amp; determined to give satisfaction I hereby apply for an
                    appointment under you on the road | W H Duckett | May 6 '87." Undoubtedly
                    Duckett, Whitman's young Camden driver, was expected to make a copy of the
                    letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
