                late night at Toronto and Hamilton seeing the inspector and the Provincial Secretary
                re case Ross v. Bucke. They do not consider me in any
                way to blame and the government will assume the case paying all costs and
                damage—but meantime we shall appeal to a higher court and try to get the
                verdict set aside. There is no manner of doubt that the verdict was a most
                outrageous breach of justice, and even (I believe) of law. Nothing was done or said
                by me that ought not to have been done and said. If I did not repeat every word in a
                similar case happening say tomorrow it would not be because I <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00240.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00240.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00240.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> ought not but because I would be afraid
                to do what was right for fear of getting into trouble.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for enclosing Stoddart's letter and especially for the little piece called "The Pallid
                    Wreath" which I find one of the most touching little
                poems I ever read.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to hear that at time of writing you were not suffering so much but it is
                plain that you are not, on the whole, having a good time. I wish—and
                wish—but can do little enough. I can find no fault with your diet and I agree
                with you that you ought to eat a fair quantity—do not believe that anything
                like abstinence would be good for you—only make you uncomfortable for nothing.
                My greatest comfort is that from Horace's accounts you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">seem</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">look</span> well and that
                being the case however you may suffer your condition cannot be out &amp; out serious </p>
