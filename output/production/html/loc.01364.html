            <p class="tei_p">I will write you a few lines without any thing to say, but because the spirit moves
                me &amp; every thing is so beautiful &amp; peaceful in the nearly declined but
                dazzling sun—The little children are playing out on the walks, a mocking-bird
                is singing over the way, &amp; a young just-bursting magnolia blossom, (sent me an
                hour ago by the grocery woman at the corner) fills the room
                with its spicy fragrance, from its glass of water on the window-sill—I have
                been somewhat under a cloud physically the last week, but feel better to
                day—&amp; the best of it is a sort of consciousness (if it don't deceive me)
                of being better for good—at any rate for the time, wh.ich is as much as could be
                asked for—</p>
		<p class="tei_p">I have written &amp; sent a poem to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Lippincotts</span>—wh. has been accepted, &amp; I have got the money for it, 
		(&amp; great good it does me, coming now)—Herbert Gilchrist<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">2</a> is here—he is drawing &amp; painting my portrait to-day—Sidney Morse<a href="#n0862" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0862">3</a> has modelled a 
large (colossal I suppose) head of me—I think perhaps the best thing yet—Love to your father, yourself &amp; Alys,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> the baby dear, &amp; all—as I end, after my supper, 
(mostly strawberries) I see glimpses of a fine sunset in the west &amp; the boys out in Mickle Street are playing base ball—</p>

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
