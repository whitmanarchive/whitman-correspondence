            <p class="tei_p">Your card of 2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> to hand. I am
                quite distressed, unhappy, about that villainous cold of yours. A real good sweat by
                means of an alcohol bath or otherwise, if you could manage it, would be the thing
                for you. Send for your Camden Dr and see if it cannot be arranged. A lovely spring
                day here—snow nearly all gone now. [—] Willy Gurd
                is in N.Y. at present, will go to Danbury  about Saturday. The Inspector is to be
                here this evening at 8.10—every thing is lively with us—wish things were
                more lively with you and I am determined I will make them a little more lively for
                you whenever this meter business comes to a prosperous issue as I think it must
                before many months—I am thinking of you all the time "and don't you forget
                it."</p>
