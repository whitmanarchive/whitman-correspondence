               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Madam
            </span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your generous remittance of $75 for the wounded &amp; sick was duly received by letter of 21st &amp; is most acceptable. So much good may be done with it. A little I find may go a great ways. It is perhaps like having a store of medicines—the difficulty is not so much in getting the medicines, it is not so important about having a great store, as it is important to apply them by rare perception, honest personal investigation, true love, &amp; if possible the inspiration &amp; tact we in other fields call genius.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The hospitals here are again full, as nearly all last week trains were arriving off &amp; on from front with sick. Very many of these however will be transferred north as soon as practicable.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Unfortunately large numbers are irreparably injured in these jolting railroad &amp; ambulance journeys, numbers dying on the road.—Of these come in lately, diarrhea, rheumatism &amp; the old camp fevers are most prevalent. The wrecks in these forms of so many hundreds of dear young American men come in lately, are terrible, &amp; make one's heart ache.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Numerically the sick are the last four or five weeks becoming alarmingly greater, &amp; in quality the cases grow more intense. I have noticed a steady deepening of this intensity of the cases of sickness, the year &amp; a half I have been with the soldiers. Hospital accommodations here are being extensively added to. Large tents are being put up, &amp; others got ready.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My friend, you must accept the men's thanks, through me. I shall remain here among the soldiers in hospital through the summer, with short excursions down in field, &amp; what help you can send me for the wounded &amp; sick I need hardly say how gladly I shall receive it &amp; apply it personally to them.</p>
