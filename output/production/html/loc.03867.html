                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden New Republic</span>. Whitman regularly visited the
                    Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey. Whitman enjoyed the
                    atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would often stay for weeks
                    at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Whitman. The two began a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
                    early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
                    the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
                    volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
                    to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13,
                        1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
                    two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
                    Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
