            <p class="tei_p">Your paper received and your postal,<a href="#n0368b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0368b">1</a> and I have been wanting to write all the week,
                but busy as usual, Today is perfectly lovely we had a refreshing rain on Friday and
                the streets look clean, and every thing bright <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="George​ ">Geo</span>​ <a href="#n0700" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0700">2</a> is busy as ever, but we generally have an hours or so drive in the evening, and I
                come home with a good appetite so it must do me good. Last week while I was at
                market Ida Johnson<a href="#n1058" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1058">3</a> must have been here, Ed<a href="#n1047" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1047">4</a> went to the door and he said it was Miss
                Johnson, have you heard from any of them? Did you see the account of the large fire
                in the southern part of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila</span>​ , a Planing mill and lumber yard and 50 <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">houses</span>. The Planing mill was Will
                Nices the cousin that comes here a good deal, Walt I think you
                have heard me speak of the child that sister <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ej">Kate</span> left at her death, she has always been with her <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">fathers​ </span></span> mother, but about a month ago, her grandmother died and we have taken
                Alice, she is nine years old, and a very good disposition, I took her feeling the
                care very much, for I really knew so little about her, only seeing her about twice a
                year but we do not find her any trouble to manage, indeed have been quite surprised
                to see how she fits right into our household ways, she is quiet, and seems perfectly
                contented with Tip for a
                companion, he appears to love her dearly, and they are always together, Alice has
                only been here since last Wednesday, so of course this is only a short experience. The
                    <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ej">Perks</span> and the
                Elversons are away, Mrs Berry and family think of going soon. Mrs Berry
                says she misses seeing you very much getting on and off the cars, and wishes to be
                remembered to you. You will miss the fire crackers and noise of the fourth in Canada a lucky miss

            I always dread the noise. I suppose you are having a good time, and keeping well, we all send love.</p>

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
                    mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death
                    in 1873. During his mother's final illness, George Whitman and his wife Louisa
                    Orr Haslam Whitman took over Eddy's care, with financial support from Walt
                    Whitman. In 1888, Eddy was moved to an asylum at Blackwood, New Jersey. For more
