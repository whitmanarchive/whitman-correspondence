Doctor, I have been away for a few days, but have now returned to remain here certainly for the winter &amp; ensuing spring, &amp; probably for two or three years. I feel much possessed with the wounded &amp; sick soldiers—they have taken a powerful hold of me, &amp; I am very happy among them—it is perhaps the greatest interchange of magnetism human relations are capable of—I have told you how young &amp; how American they mostly are—so on my own account—I shall continue as a missionary among them as sure as I live—I shall continue for years—tell your friend that his <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">mony​ </span></span> is being distributed as <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">mony​ </span></span> or what little <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">purchas​ </span></span> I find appropriate for the men of all states—I reject none of course—not rebel wounded nor blacks, nor any when I find them suffering &amp; dying—Doctor to the other friends that assisted me in Boston &amp; to yourself, I send my regards &amp; love</p>
