        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend Abby,</span>
<span class="tei_salute">(&amp; Dear friends all)</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">The letter of the 28th reached me yesterday after going wrong and was truly welcome. 
        (I suppose you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  my postal card acknowledging your previous one, briefly, &amp; saying I should prefer the upper room.) 
        Since then I have had another bad spell—has lasted some fifteen days—head, legs, 
        gastric region, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> bad—but am to-day feeling decidedly better. I shall <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">quite 
        certainly</span> come on—cannot now [pla]n the time, but will write before—&amp; take up my quarters a while with you, as it seems to be agreeable, &amp; the moderate sum 
        you mention I should pay thankfully—Though badly disabled, I am perfectly able 
        to take care of myself, &amp; my sister says I am no trouble—I am sure we would all get along well together—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have just <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  a letter from Mrs. O'Connor, from Washington, today. Her daughter, 
        (just 16,) is not well, has had a form of measles, a second attack, quite severe, 
        &amp; is otherwise ailing, but I think will probably come out of it all, &amp; grow stronger. 
        I was glad to hear about your dear grandchildren—and about our friends 
        Mrs. Davis &amp; Mrs. Rein—I am alone, in the house to-day, (except Eddy)—as my sister has gone out 
        to spend the day, &amp; my brother has gone to Easton, about his work. My brother Jeff, 
        at St. Louis, is well—his girls are growing finely.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here in the parlor—it is about 11½—the sun has just come out, after a cloudy 
        half-rainy morning—is mild &amp; warm—I go out for about an hour generally about noon, 
        with my cane, (&amp; accompanied by my little yellow &amp; white dog, a most faithful affectionate 
        companion)—frequently take a ride in the cars, or across in the boat—the men quite all know me, &amp; are very kind.
      </p>
