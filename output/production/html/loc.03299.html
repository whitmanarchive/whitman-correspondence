            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">I got yours of the 4th instant, written on the back of Kennedy's, and meant to have written you long before, as well as after, but have been in a
                wretched condition with the "misery in my back," as the colored brother calls it. I don't improve in my back and legs as rapidly as I
                ought, and am nearly as lame and heavy as you are, but keep hoping.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have wanted to hear how you are, especially your eyes, which you don't mention. The
                state of your eyes worries <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03299.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03299.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03299.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> me more than anything else about you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did you see the enclosed, cut from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span>, from the
                great Italian fortnightly? The article must be a splendid one to bear such
                excerpting by the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span>! We
                tried to get the magazine through Brentano, but failed. It must make these fellows
                gnash their teeth to see this growing foreign appreciation.—Send the slip back
                some time when you are writing.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I got a copy of Kennedy's pamphlet from him, and but for
                my bad condition would have written to him, which I will do yet. I cant help
                feeling that he skates on pretty thin ice <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03299.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03299.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03299.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>sometimes, though he says many
                things which are quite undeniable.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter from Grace Channing recently in which she
                says: "By the way, there is in the latest edition of Leaves of Grass a
                poem—'The City Dead-House'—which affects me I cannot tell you how
                powerfully. I never saw it before, and I think Walt has never written anything more
                divinely beautiful. Often as I have read it, I can't keep the tears out of my
                eyes."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Channings are all very happy in their new home at Pasadena in California. It
                appears to be a perfect Paradise</p>

                G. White, even at my expense! Reason, Shakespearean
                hostility to the subject. This is a pretty note! I am now going to try Boston.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The death of Mrs. Gilchrist deeply stirred me. I was just about
                to try to write to her when I saw the news of her decease.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When you next write, tell me how your eyes are. I am really anxious to know.
