                                    New York is to have a monument to Goethe. It is to be erected in Central Park, at an expense
                                    of $30,000. The sculptor is Henry Baerer, who designed the Beethoven monument in New York
                                    and the John Howard Payne statue in Brooklyn. The Goethe monument is to be twenty-four feet high, with a colossal bronze
                                    figure of the great German poet at the summit, and four lifesize sitting groups in bronze around the granite
                                    pedestal, viz., "Faust and Margaret," "Iphigenia and Orestes," "Hermann and Dorothea at the Well," "The Harpist and Mignon."
                                    The cost will be defrayed by the students and admirers of Goethe, with the coöperation of the Goethe Society.</p>

                                    In person, Emin is a slender man, of medium height, and tough and wiry figure. He is swarthy,
                                    with black eyes and hair. His face is that of a studious professional man, and that impression is heightened
                                    by the glasses which he always wears. His attitudes and movements are, however, very alert. He stands erect and with his heels
                                    together, as if he had been trained as a soldier. He was always reticent about himself, and his history
                                    was knownt to no one in the Soudan or the Provinces of the Equator. He was supposed to be a Mohammedan. I am not sure
                                    that he ever said that he was, but I am quite sure that he did not deny it when I knew him. It has become known later
                                    that he is a German, of university education; but there were many at that time who thought that he was a Turk of extraordinary
                                    acquirements. He is certainly a man of great ability in many ways, and of strong character. Just why such a man should have gone where he has and stayed there is
                                    hard to see. Probably it was largely force of circumstances and a spirit of adventure. Certainly when he went there there was no prospect of much
                                    pay or distinction, and he was actuated by no great philanthropic ardor. Responsibilities gradually came upon him, and he rose to them.
                                    It is easy to see how, in a character like Emin's—sympathetic, reflective and enthusiastic—noble purposes were developed
                                    with a noble example before him and great opportunities around him. Emin's uncertain power in a savage land is all that remains of the late khedive's 
                                    central African Empire. [Colonel H. G. Prout, in November Scribner.</p>
