                                    In person, Emin is a slender man, of medium height, and tough and wiry figure. He is swarthy,
                                    with black eyes and hair. His face is that of a studious professional man, and that impression is heightened
                                    by the glasses which he always wears. His attitudes and movements are, however, very alert. He stands erect and with his heels
                                    together, as if he had been trained as a soldier. He was always reticent about himself, and his history
                                    was knownt to no one in the Soudan or the Provinces of the Equator. He was supposed to be a Mohammedan. I am not sure
                                    that he ever said that he was, but I am quite sure that he did not deny it when I knew him. It has become known later
                                    that he is a German, of university education; but there were many at that time who thought that he was a Turk of extraordinary
                                    acquirements. He is certainly a man of great ability in many ways, and of strong character. Just why such a man should have gone where he has and stayed there is
                                    hard to see. Probably it was largely force of circumstances and a spirit of adventure. Certainly when he went there there was no prospect of much
                                    pay or distinction, and he was actuated by no great philanthropic ardor. Responsibilities gradually came upon him, and he rose to them.
                                    It is easy to see how, in a character like Emin's—sympathetic, reflective and enthusiastic—noble purposes were developed
                                    with a noble example before him and great opportunities around him. Emin's uncertain power in a savage land is all that remains of the late khedive's

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship

                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
