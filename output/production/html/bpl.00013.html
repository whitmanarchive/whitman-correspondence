                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston

                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
                    the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
