                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    Bucke's letters to Traubel on April 21 and 24 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of

                    D.C.) and Wallace's letter to Whitman on April 30, 1891 (typescript in Bolton).
                    The article, unabridged, appears in Horace Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and

                    praise: "Its only fault is that it ends too soon—I should like a big Vol.
                    of just such pages—I could read in it day and night. And by &amp; by

                    (1571–1630) was a German astronomer and a mathematician. He is known for
                    his laws of planetary motion, and his writings proved foundational for Isaac
                    Newton's theory of universal gravitation. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">13. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08034_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08034_n7"><span>Whitman is referring to the
                    proofs for his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> (1891). The book
                    was his last miscellany, and it included both poetry and short prose works
                    commenting on poetry, aging, and death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems
                    from the book were later printed as "Good-Bye my Fancy 2d Annex" to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> (1891–1892), the last edition of
