                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    as the "big book," was published by the poet himself—in an arrangement
                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen

                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    was the father of Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in
                    Camden. Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White
                    Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several
                    occasions. For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G.

                    18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a
                    relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by early Whitman scholarship,
                    in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in the first six volumes of
                    Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>—though
                    it does appear frequently in the last three volumes, which were published only
                    in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son"
                    (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H.
                    Johnston), but the relationship between the two also had a romantic, erotic
                    charge to it. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    New Jersey. She married Harry Lamb Stafford on June 25, 1883, and together they
                    had three children. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08087_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08087_n2"><span>A major flu pandemic in
