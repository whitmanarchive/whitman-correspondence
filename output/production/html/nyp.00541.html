                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
                    in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
                    the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:
