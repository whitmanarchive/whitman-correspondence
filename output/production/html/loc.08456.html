                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    Jessie and her sister Manahatta "Hattie" were both favorites of their uncle
                    Walt. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had informed Walt Whitman on <a href="duk.00435">March 5, 1865</a> that "sis is not well yet she seems
                    to have A kind of fever." The nickname "Sis" was given first to Manahatta but
                    was passed to her younger sister Jessie Louisa when Manahatta became "Hattie."
                    The letter dates to 1865, so "Sis" is Jessie Louisa. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n7033">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n7033 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n7033"><span>Hannah Louisa Whitman Heyde
                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For
                    more information, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    an unsent draft letter written on August 6, 1889. From his confessions in

                    lonely and loveless childhood, that he was reared a Roman Catholic only to
                    become a freethinker, that he became a teacher at an early age but then drifted

                    year before in his own eyes he was "a failure" and "an enigma to myself." He saw
                    Whitman as an heroic father figure: "Had Carlyle added another chapter to his

                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human

                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest

                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
