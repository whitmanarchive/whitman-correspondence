            <p class="tei_p">Have just been looking over the "Transfer" pamphlet you sent—pages 46, '7, to
                which you call'd my attention are (I allow myself to think) a latent flattering
                unction to me &amp; the ways I suggest of looking at questions in America. Indeed such things do me more good than you think
                for—I am just going over to Germantown to spend to-night, to-morrow &amp; till
                Thursday noon in the big family &amp; big house, wife, son, two splendid daughters
                of a Quaker friend, whose carriage comes for me presently. The eldest daughter, age 20, an admirer of L. of G. who comes up even to you. Thanks for the MS.—(as I write, has not yet
                arrived but will be here soon no doubt)—You shall see the proof—all your
                wishes shall be followed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am curious to see the Carlyle-Emerson letters—(had not heard before about my
                being in them)—You hit long ago on the reason-why
                of the Emerson (apparent) change, or defection or cloud—whatever it is to be
                call'd—it was the interference, doubtless <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hard lying</span>,
                of others—there was &amp; is a little knot of my most malignant enemies, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">deadly haters</span>, in &amp; around Boston—some in high
                quarters—&amp; they plied the man incessantly—Then above all that appears
                or he <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">appears</span> to say—you may be sure that E loved
                me—I believe more than he did any one—he showed it at first, &amp;
                stronger still at <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">last</span>—that Saturday evn'g &amp; Sunday
                afternoon he &amp; I were (mostly silently) together in September, 1881, at Concord,
                told it—told better than ever can be put in words—</p>
