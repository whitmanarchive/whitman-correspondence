            <p class="tei_p">Have just been looking over the "Transfer" pamphlet you sent—pages 46, '7, to
                which you call'd my attention are (I allow myself to think) a latent flattering
                unction to me &amp; the ways I suggest of looking at questions in America.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Indeed such things do me more good than you think
                for—I am just going over to Germantown to spend to-night, to-morrow &amp; till
                Thursday noon in the big family &amp; big house, wife, son, two splendid daughters
                of a Quaker friend, whose carriage comes for me presently.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> The eldest daughter, age 20, an admirer of L. of G. who comes up even to you.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Thanks for the MS.—(as I write, has not yet

                of others—there was &amp; is a little knot of my most malignant enemies, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">deadly haters</span>, in &amp; around Boston—some in high
                quarters—&amp; they plied the man incessantly—Then above all that appears

                stronger still at <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">last</span>—that Saturday evn'g &amp; Sunday
                afternoon he &amp; I were (mostly silently) together in September, 1881, at Concord,

                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> excerpts from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    1834–1872 (1883). He particularly objected to Emerson's reference to
                    Whitman in one of the letters (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.51.html">Monday, September 3, 1888</a>, 251): "The letter, as printed, is very
                    characteristic of Emerson—his reserve, his shrinking, like a woman's,
                    because of rebuff; his deceptive concessions to the enemy, in a vein of
                    pleasantry, almost like irony, almost like a sneer, when he says the book
                    'wanted good morals so much' that he did not send it" (<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.82.html">Monday, June 18, 1888</a>, 352). In 1888 Whitman agreed with O'Connor:
                    "Emerson should have said yes or no—not yes-no" (<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.82.html">Monday, June 18, 1888</a>, 353). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00476_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00476_n6"><span>See the letter from Walt
