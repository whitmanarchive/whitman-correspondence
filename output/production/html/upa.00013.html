            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I send by same mail with this, my latest piece, copied in a newspaper—&amp; will write you just a line or two. I suppose you duly received my former letters (two)—I ought to have written something about your children (described to me in your letter of last summer, July 23d, which I have just been reading again)—Dear boys &amp; girls—how my heart goes out to them—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Did I tell you that I had received letters from Tennyson, &amp; that he cordially invites me to visit him? Sometimes I dream of journeying to Old England, on such visit—&amp; then of seeing you &amp; your children—but it is a dream only.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am still living here in employment in a Government office—My health is good—Life is rather sluggish here—though not without the sunshine—(Your letters too were warm, bright rays of it)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am going on to New York soon to remain there a few weeks—but my address will still be here—I wrote lately to Mr. Rossetti quite a long letter—My present address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington, D. C. U. S. America.</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Best love &amp; remembrance to you, dear friend, &amp; to the young folk—</span>
