I suppose you duly received my former letters (two)—I ought to have written something about your children (described to me in your letter of last summer, July 23d, which I have just been reading again)—Dear boys &amp; girls—how my heart goes out to them<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Did I tell you that I had received letters from Tennyson, &amp; that he cordially invites me to visit him? Sometimes I dream of journeying to Old England, on such visit—&amp; then of seeing you &amp; your children—but it is a dream only.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am still living here in employment in a Government office—My health is good—Life is rather sluggish here—though not without the sunshine—(Your letters too were warm, bright rays of it)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am going on to New York soon to remain there a few weeks<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>—but my address will still be here—I wrote lately to Mr. Rossetti quite a long letter<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a>—My present address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington, D.

                    suggests this timeline is a misstatement concerning Whitman's intended stay in
                    Brooklyn, since, in his <a href="loc.01711">February 2, 1872</a> letter to
                    Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman wrote that he would remain in New York until April 10.
                    Miller also points out that Whitman sent Schmidt an address in Brooklyn where he
                    would be staying, while he provided Gilchrist only his address in
                    Washington. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00013_n6 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="upa.00013_n6"><span>This letter to William
