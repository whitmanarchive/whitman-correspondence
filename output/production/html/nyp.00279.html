                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter reached me this afternoon. I am very glad indeed you are coming home<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—I already make
                calculations not only of resuming our old talks &amp; good times, but of the much
                news you will have to tell—also of seeing little Jenny again—dear
                child, be sure she is not left out of account—Is Mrs. Channing<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> with you then? I send my friendliest remembrances
                &amp; good wishes. And to my ever dear friends, Mrs. Price &amp; family—you
                know how much I think of them, &amp; estimate them always, with love &amp;
                thanks—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is between two &amp; three o'clock p. m.—We have had a snowy day—as I
                look out of my window the ground is white in every direction—William<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> has a bad cold, has not been down to work to-day, but has
                just come down town, &amp; is this moment sitting by my desk, reading the extra
                Evening <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span>—the fight between Congress &amp; the
                President, about Secretary of War,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> rages furiously—The House will doubtless order <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">impeachment</span>—&amp; we are going to have exciting times
                generally—but I guess no appeal to arms—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have heard lately from my dear mother—she is well as usual—Emma Price
                can tell you more directly about her, as I hear, (to my great pleasure) that she has
                called on mother once or twice lately.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> I am well as usual—have not yet
                rec'd a copy of my English re-print<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—but hear that
                one is on the way—Mr. Swinburne, the poet, has sent me a handsome copy of his
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake</span><a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> containing certain mention of me, which I will show you when you come.
                    Hotten,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> the London publisher, has written
                me, very handsomely, offering a fee, on every copy—Rossetti, the editor, has
                also written me several letters, very satisfactory—I think you will like your
                apartments, after you get used to them—it is a fresh, sweet, new house<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a>—that's a good deal—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">And now, dear friend, God bless you &amp; little one, &amp; a safe &amp; speedy
                return to friends &amp; home. </p>
