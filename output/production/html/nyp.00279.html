                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter reached me this afternoon. I am very glad indeed you are coming home—I already make
                calculations not only of resuming our old talks &amp; good times, but of the much
                news you will have to tell—also of seeing little Jenny again—dear
                child, be sure she is not left out of account—Is Mrs. Channing with you then? I send my friendliest remembrances
                &amp; good wishes. And to my ever dear friends, Mrs. Price &amp; family—you
                know how much I think of them, &amp; estimate them always, with love &amp;
                thanks—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is between two &amp; three o'clock p. m.—We have had a snowy day—as I
                look out of my window the ground is white in every direction—William has a bad cold, has not been down to work to-day, but has
                just come down town, &amp; is this moment sitting by my desk, reading the extra
                Evening <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span>—the fight between Congress &amp; the
                President, about Secretary of War, rages furiously—The House will doubtless order <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">impeachment</span>—&amp; we are going to have exciting times
                generally—but I guess no appeal to arms—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have heard lately from my dear mother—she is well as usual—Emma Price
                can tell you more directly about her, as I hear, (to my great pleasure) that she has
                called on mother once or twice lately. I am well as usual—have not yet
                rec'd a copy of my English re-print—but hear that
                one is on the way—Mr. Swinburne, the poet, has sent me a handsome copy of his
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake</span> containing certain mention of me, which I will show you when you come.
                    Hotten, the London publisher, has written
                me, very handsomely, offering a fee, on every copy—Rossetti, the editor, has
                also written me several letters, very satisfactory—I think you will like your
                apartments, after you get used to them—it is a fresh, sweet, new house—that's a good deal—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">And now, dear friend, God bless you &amp; little one, &amp; a safe &amp; speedy
                return to friends &amp; home. </p>
