            </span>

            <p class="tei_p"> I wrote you several days ago asking you to tell me whether $100 was
                your lowest price. I think I said also that if you charged lower than that price I
                could sell a great many more articles for you than I could at these rates. I enclose
                a check for $60, which is payment for the article according to your own estimate of
                3,000 words, at the rate of $20 a thousand, which is the very highest rate they
                    pay. I had to decide within ten minutes whether I
                would accept it or not, as Mr. Ferris, who is in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">charce​ </span><span class="tei_corr">charge​
        
      </span></span> of the syndicate, was just about to start for Mount McGregor. I told him,
                however, that if you refused to sell the article for less I should <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03287.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03287.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03287.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> consider myself
                responsible for the balance and expect payment for it either from him or from Mr.
                Rice.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> So my dear old friend I have protected your interests to the best of my judgement and
                if you want me to follow orders and break owners in future let me know and I
                will do it. The great problem that the universe is asking you this moment is whether
                I am to regard this check as payment in full or payment on account. I also would 
                like you to answer my letters. I have no interest whatever in the syndicate to which
                I sold the manuscript. </p>
