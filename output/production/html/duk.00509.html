                to have any body so and not know
                what is the cause i thought of every
                thing i had said if i had said anything
                to give him reason but i dont think
                i did any thing) he is getting along
                pretty well with his work they
                have got another job not very
                extensive a house to fit up in warren st
                i dont think they will make a great 
                deal out of the job in new york
                but it is only my surmise George
                dont say much about it they have
                taken up 1000 dollars and George says
                he has paid it all out but perhaps
                they will do better than i think)</p>

                    December 15, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "December the 15,"
                    and the letter begins, "if it wasent sunday." The most probable reading is that
                    she wrote her letter on Sunday, and December 15, 1867 fell on Sunday. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1867, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
                    Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> (New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–77), 1:356, n. 54; 1:379). The year is
                    consistent with the presence of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his family
                    in Brooklyn and with efforts to remove James "Jimmy" Whitman, son of Walt's
                    deceased brother Andrew Jackson Whitman, from the care of his mother Nancy
                    McClure Whitman, an effort that would intensify in spring 1868. Other factors
                    consistent with the year 1867 are the status of George Washington Whitman's
                    business of building houses on speculation and the casual reference to daughter
                    Hannah (Whitman) Heyde. The latter reference rules out the following year
                    because in late 1868 Hannah had a serious infection required amputation of her
                    thumb in December. </span></span> [<a href="#r17">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a

                    Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
                    Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
                    between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
                    Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
                    treatment of Hannah. Louisa wrote, "if heyde was kind to her she would get well"

                    Whitman's request to Walt Whitman that he "write to that man about young jim,"
                    the phrase "that man" most likely refers to Edward McClure, the brother of Nancy
                    McClure, who was the spouse of Louisa's deceased son Andrew Jackson Whitman.
                    James "Jimmy" was Louisa's grandson, the child of Andrew and Nancy. The effort
                    to remove Nancy's children resumed with greater intensity the following year.
                    After a May 1868 visit that from Jane McClure (Edward McClure's wife), Louisa
                    wrote to Walt that the McClures sought to have Jim placed into a public orphan
                    asylum (see her <a href="duk.00544">May 1868</a> letter to Walt). In May
                    1868, Louisa asked Walt to write to James Cornwell, a friend of Andrew who
