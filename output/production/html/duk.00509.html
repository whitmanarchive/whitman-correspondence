                over his quiet spell and seems
                like old times again i hope it wont
                occur again very soon i cant bear
                to have any body so and not know
                what is the cause i thought of every
                thing i had said if i had said anything
                to give him reason but i dont think
                i did any thing) he is getting along
                pretty well with his work they
                have got another job not very
                extensive a house to fit up in warren st
                i dont think they will make a great 
                deal out of the job in new york
                but it is only my surmise George
                dont say much about it they have
                taken up 1000 dollars and George says
                he has paid it all out but perhaps
                they will do better than i think)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i am going to write to han
                i have left
                the dinner table standing to write this
                and will write to her as there is a lull
                in the young fry department i wish tha<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">t</span>
                you would write to that man about jim
                he certainly is going to destruction
                i wrote a
                note to nancy to ask her if she would fix him up
                but she nor him has not been here since
                she has very many things given her that she might
                do very well
