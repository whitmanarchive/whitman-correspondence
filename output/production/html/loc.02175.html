            <p class="tei_p">I have been a good deal worried of late. My Publisher—T. Fisher Unwin prepared a
                contract which does not satisfy lawyers and business men—nor me either when
                they explained it.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> Hence delays, insolent
                letters—in short, matters came to such a pass that I have placed the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">un</span>signed

            <p class="tei_p">The upshot of it all will be that either Unwin will sign my agreement as drawn by

            <p class="tei_p">The bone of contention is over the change of form: the publisher wishes to reserve to
                himself the exclusive right of altering the form &amp; price of editions with out
                taking heed of author's wishes. Though Unwin owns that it is a good book, and that the author is getting
                very little for it; yet he has the cheek to stand out for this cool
                proposition—and my advisers (amongst them is one of the ablest lawyers in

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
                    (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
                    partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
                    covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
                    powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York, Rowman
                    and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
                    translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
                    O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on <a href="med.00324">August 13,
                        1864</a>, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
                    attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
                    pistol."
                    Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
                    phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
                    (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
                    I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
                    trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
                    Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first category of his threefold
                    evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and
                    "Blame." In his entry for April 18, 1864, the Count referred to Whitman as among
                    "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote
                    (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had
                    "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that
                    would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised

                    social center for political and cultural figures. Mrs. Eames remained loyal to
                    the controversial Count Gurowski after he had been discredited by many people,
