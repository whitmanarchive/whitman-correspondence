                I have lately discovered in Englewood a nest of your friends, &amp; among them to particularly mention are Dr Champlin &amp; wife. The Dr is a genuine sort of an oddity with brains and generous human impulses. 
                He is proud of an oration he gave before the County Normal School in 
                which he has a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">refference​ </span><span class="tei_corr">reference​
        
      </span></span> to you. At my request he sends the paragraph on the back of his own photo. His wife has for years been an invalid &amp; 
                they are not blest with children. He has a certain glumness of facial expression and and

                abruptness of speech, and a dont-care-a-bit air about him, which deceives some 
                of his neighbors, &amp; they put him down as "pessimistic." (By the way, that is a word so common just now with aspiring people 
                here. Wheresoever I go some one will be sure to say—"Yes, but dont you 
                think he (or she) takes a pessimistic view of life?" And I feel so like retorting bluntly &amp; vehemently,—"Damn it, no! 
                Why in hell should he?" The smack of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">incincere​ </span><span class="tei_corr">insincere​
        
      </span></span>, pretentious "culture" 
                is so apparent and exasperating.) Champlin simply despised so much of the gibberish that he is forced to 
                encounter, and hasn't the grace to conceal his <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">growl</span>.

                and has been ever since she heard that I had seen you eager to know all I could tell her. I gave her the little plaque I made of you, which 
                hangs conspicuously in the little study—What do you think, (or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">whom</span>, rather) she wants me to make as 
                companion? Why, old Socrates! I suppose I must do it. She is utterly helpless save 
                a slight use of her hands, and sits all day in a low wheeled-chair; Suffers much &amp; has tears of great frustration. But when I go over to 
                talk of you, or Emerson, Carlyle or Cleveland, whom she has a liking for, 
                she puts her ailings aside. My drawings and my clay greatly interest her and a large company of boys &amp; girls who flock to her porch 
                ("stoop" I called it to the wonderment of the children). The Dr is anxious that I should teach modeling at the Normal School <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">this</span>

                It would greatly interest her &amp; soften her affliction if she had a line of yours written with your swan's pen. When years ago 
                she admired your "Leaves of Grass" the wrapper had something written on it which she preserves.</p>

                I am glad to hear how comfortable you keep, despite the beseiged body, and hope you may count yet many more birth days on the already good list.

                As for myself I am hopeful amid tribulations of pocket that seem to pursue me ever. 
                I think it would be a good psychological study for some one to regard me as I am for a week or two and then suddenly endow me with a warm 
                million. In the various drudgeries I have performed in past years (for 
                the sake of somewhat worthwhile if I never get it) I am sure I have earned it all. 
                I'd not say "Beggar that I am, I thank you," but, "Ah, ha! God sends my due—or approximates it. My busts sell, but my 
                landlord stands at the door.

                My lectures succeed, but the money they bring takes me back home, 
                &amp; then comes a dying whisper—"nothing left—exhausted."
