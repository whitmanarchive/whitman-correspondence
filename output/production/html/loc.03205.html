                I have lately discovered in Englewood a nest of your friends, &amp; among them to particularly mention are Dr Champlin &amp; wife.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">1</a> The Dr is a genuine sort of an oddity with brains and generous human impulses. 
                He is proud of an oration he gave before the County Normal School in 
                which he has a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">refference​ </span></span> to you. At my request he sends the paragraph on the back of his own photo. His wife has for years been an invalid &amp; 
                they are not blest with children. He has a certain glumness of facial expression and and

                of his neighbors, &amp; they put him down as "pessimistic." (By the way, that is a word so common just now with aspiring people 
                here. Wheresoever I go some one will be sure to say—"Yes, but dont you 
                think he (or she) takes a pessimistic view of life?" And I feel so like retorting bluntly &amp; vehemently,—"Damn it, no! 
                Why in hell should he?" The smack of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">incincere​ </span></span>, pretentious "culture" 
                is so apparent and exasperating.) Champlin simply despised so much of the gibberish that he is forced to 
                encounter, and hasn't the grace to conceal his <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">growl</span>.

                hangs conspicuously in the little study—What do you think, (or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">whom</span>, rather) she wants me to make as 
                companion? Why, old Socrates!<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">3</a> I suppose I must do it. She is utterly helpless save 
                a slight use of her hands, and sits all day in a low wheeled-chair; Suffers much &amp; has tears of great frustration. But when I go over to 
                talk of you, or Emerson,<a href="#n1044" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1044">4</a> Carlyle<a href="#n0139" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0139">5</a> or Cleveland,<a href="#n4271" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4271">6</a> whom she has a liking for, 
                she puts her ailings aside. My drawings and my clay greatly interest her and a large company of boys &amp; girls who flock to her porch 
                ("stoop" I called it to the wonderment of the children). The Dr is anxious that I should teach modeling at the Normal School <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">this</span>

                As for myself I am hopeful amid tribulations of pocket that seem to pursue me ever. 
                I think it would be a good psychological study for some one to regard me as I am for a week or two and then suddenly endow me with a warm 
                million. In the various drudgeries I have performed in past years (for 
                the sake of somewhat worthwhile if I never get it) I am sure I have earned it all. 
                I'd not say "Beggar that I am, I thank you," but, "Ah, ha! God sends my due—or approximates it. My busts sell, but my
