            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write you a line once more, but no particular news to send.
                Everything goes on much in the old way (and always has, and always will, I reckon,
                in this old world).</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am alive, and here, in the same locality, but pretty feeble. Wanted to thank you
                again, and more specifically, dear E.C., for the help you have so kindly sent
                meâ€”you and my dear friends the two Misses Ford, to
                whom I send thanks and love.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just had my dinner, (buckwheat cakes, and tea, good). I am sitting here in the
                little front room downstairs writing this. Always love. Write.</p>
