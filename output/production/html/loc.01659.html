                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
                    Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>,
                    ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing,
                    1998). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01659_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01659_n1"><span>Though, admittedly, there
                    is little concrete information in this letter to aid in establishing the year,
                    the executors' assignment of this letter to 1875 seems questionable for the
                    following reasons: in a letter to Doyle of <a href="loc.01747">August 22,
                        1873</a>, Whitman also asked for a copy of the Sunday <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>; he expected this letter to arrive in Washington on Saturday,
                    August 30—"Send me the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> to-morrow"; and in
                    1875 he invariably gave his Camden street address in the headings of his
                    letters. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
