                was not so well as when he

                better i gave him the 10 d when
                he went the last time he looks
                very bad indeed he could
                only work a half a day at a time
                he says he wouldent care
                about living only for his
                children i think nance might
                do better at any rate she might
                keep things a little cleaner
                i hope he will be better but

    <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n14">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00427_n14 note" id="duk.00427_n14"><span>
                    <p class="tei_p">This letter dates to a range from August 31, 1863, the most likely date of
                        composition, through September 2, 1863, the last possible date. Richard
                        Maurice Bucke dated this letter September 3, 1863, a date based, presumably,
                        on Walt Whitman's having received Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's "letters
                        sent Sept 3d containing your letter" (see Walt's <a href="loc.00788">September 8, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). Edwin
                        Haviland Miller also dated this letter September 3?, 1863 or "about"
                        September 3, 1863 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>
                        [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:373).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">How one dates this letter depends in part on a reading of two letters by Jeff
                        Whitman. Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price dated two of Jeff's letters
                        September 5, 1863, because Walt acknowledged that date in his September 8,
                        1863 letter (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00420">September 5?, 1863</a> and
                        his second <a href="loc.00421">September 5?, 1863</a> letters to
                        Walt). Berthold and Price note the inconsistency in the latter letter
                        between Jeff's statement that he wrote on Wednesday and his date September
                        5, which fell on a Saturday. That inconsistency makes the dates of the two
                        letters from Louisa, which Jeff enclosed in his, nearly impossible to
                        resolve based on Jeff's letter dates.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Walt seems to have responded to this letter's concerns about Andrew Jackson
                        Whitman in his <a href="loc.00788">September 8, 1863</a>. If so, this
                        letter is probably the one that Jeff enclosed with his first <a href="loc.00420">September 5?, 1863</a> letter, though Jeff's
                        letter, which does not include a day of the week, would probably need to
                        date September 3, 1863. That date must remain speculative because an earlier
                        non-extant letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman about Andrew's ongoing
                        illness may have also elicited Walt's concerns.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The most reliable way to date this letter is to the Brooklyn draft and to
                        Walt's brother George Washington Whitman's acknowledgment of his mother's
                        August 30 letter (not extant) in George's <a href="duk.00345">September
                            7, 1863</a> letter. Louisa in this letter says that she wrote to her
                        son George "last night." Therefore, the letter that she wrote George "last
                        night" could be dated or postmarked on August 30, which would date the
                        writing of this letter (the next day) to August 31 or September 1. Louisa
                        also mentions the drafts in Brooklyn: military drafts were held on August
                        31, September 1, and September 2, 1863. She refers twice to Andrew's
                        drinking binge as "last monday" and once as "that day one week ago." Because
                        August 31 fell on a Monday, it is consistent both with her statement on the
                        military draft, her writing on a Monday, and with her having written
                        George's August 30 letter "last night." Therefore, Louisa presumably wrote
                        one letter to Walt on August 31, 1863 and another on September 2. August 31,
                        1863 is the most likely date of this letter, the one that prompted Jeff to
                        apologize in his <a href="loc.00420">early September 1863 letter</a>,
                        which also included this letter from his mother written "some days ago" as
                        an enclosure. However, since Jeff also enclosed a letter from Louisa with
                        his <a href="loc.00421">September 5?, 1863</a> to Walt, this letter
                        could date as late as September 2, 1863. Ultimately, this letter is dated to
                        accord with Louisa's statement on the Brooklyn draft and with her having
                        written George's August 30 letter "last night."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in

                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
