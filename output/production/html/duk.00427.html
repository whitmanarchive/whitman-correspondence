                nancy had not put them
                up she told him to put them
                up himself and his having
                drank some he was very angry
                and he went away without
                taking any thing he was in
                a waggon with jim <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_high">C</span>ornell
                and Buckly they were going
                to take him to the boat i
                blamed nancy very much
                so they came around here
                and stopped i see andrew
                had been drinking i said
                to him that i would not give
                him the 10 dollars i promised
                him as i knew he had money
                then) i thought probably they
                would have a spree but
                he went as far as suffron
                station about 30 miles and
                came back and went again
                on thursday nancy came here
                the night after he first went
                with very great complaints
                she said georgee
                was sick

                and left her without any
                money i gave her one dollar
                and one of my gowns and
                a quilt petticoat little jim
                was here yesterday

                and nancy has been here
                to day and she has got a letter
                from Andrew he wrote he
                was not so well as when he
                went away i gave her some
                paper and envelopes and
                told her to write to him he
                had better come home)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">if they had taken the money
                and got a place up above
                here a comfortable place
                i think it would have been
                better i gave him the 10 d when
                he went the last time he looks
                very bad indeed he could
                only work a half a day at a time
                he says he wouldent care
                about living only for his
                children i think nance might
                do better at any rate she might
                keep things a little cleaner
                i hope he will be better but
                am afraid it has gone to long</p>
