            <p class="tei_p">I have this afternoon received, read, and remailed to you galleys 37 to 45
                    inclusive. I open and read these parcels of proof in
                fear and trembling (you must go as easy as you can, you are the terrible surgeon
                with the knife &amp; saw and I am the patient). You left out my remarks on "Children
                of Adam", I believe they were good but I
                acquiesce—your additions are excellent as they have
                been all through. I shall not feel half comfortable <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">untill​ </span><span class="tei_corr">until​
        
      </span></span> I have had the proof of the rest of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="part​ ">p</span>​  ii and have seen how much of me will be left. Poor O'Connor too, he had to submit to the fatal shears—but you are going to make a book of it (if that be
                possible) so go ahead if we do flinch. But still, for the Lord's sake, spare my ch
                iii pt ii as much as possible. I want you, please (if I am not speaking <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">to​ </span><span class="tei_corr">too​
        
      </span></span> late)

                to save the M.S. and send it all to me when you are done with it. I
                shall be glad to have plate proofs as fast as made, if I see any thing in them that
                needs correcting will notify you otherwise will just put them by—I suppose you
                do not want them returned? It is still <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">winter</span> here, lots
                of snow, good sleighing,</p>
