                    (1832–1904) was a writer and editor best known for his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> and over 6,000 leading articles for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (Mary Ellis Gibson, ed., "Sir Edwin
                    Arnold," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Anglophone Poetry in Colonial India,
                        1780–1913</span> [Athens: Ohio University Press, 2011], 259–260).
                    He visited Whitman in 1889 and in 1891. For an account of Arnold's 1889 visit,
                    see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering." Arnold
                    published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and
                        Lands</span> (1891). There are at least two additional accounts of this visit;
                    "Arnold and Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Times</span> (Philadelphia, PA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00519.html">September 15, 1889</a>, and a different article, also titled "Arnold and
                    Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Daily Picayune</span>
                    (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. He also paid a surprise visit to Whitman in
                    Camden on November 2, 1891. An account of the visit was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Press</span> with the title "A Poet's Greetings to
                    a Poet." See Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    Traubel described the account of Whitman's visit with Arnold as "almost
                    idiotic—certainly foolish." See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Springfield
