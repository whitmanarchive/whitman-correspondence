            </span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I received your Welcome letter on the 8 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="instant​ ">ins</span>​  accompanied With 
                a copy of New York Herald  I am Very thankful for the Paper  but i think your description of the Procession beats 
                theirs all to pieces  I can almost imagine myself Wedged &amp; Blocked in on a 3rd Ave car. 
                Nothing of interest here at present every thing looks Very Dull &amp; Miserable  yesterday &amp; today is Very 
                Cold  leaves all falling off the trees strewing the ground in every direction  since i wrote last, i came across 
                Sydnor driver of 7th St  he is well &amp; doing first rate  he 
                sends his love &amp; best respect. Mr. Hart got on my car last night on my last trip. 
                We had a long conversation about everything in general  first we commenced on home affairs  he is troubled a good 
                deal about a house he bought &amp; now wants to get rid of it  We next started on Politics  he would Vote for 
                Grant but he is no Radical &amp; last we wound up with Newspapers  he wants to start 
                a paper here soon  he is tired of working for others  You may not be interested with his affairs so i will come 
                to close  excuse this short letter as my car is going [to] start &amp; i want [to] put this in the mail</p>
