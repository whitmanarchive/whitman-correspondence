                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    Whitman's letter of <a href="loc.01583">October 9, 1868</a>, in
                    which the poet chronicles his observation of the sights, sounds, and people on
                    Broadway street in New York: "it is a never-ending amusement &amp; study
                    &amp; recreation for me to ride a couple of hours, of a pleasant afternoon, on a
                    Broadway stage in this way. You see everything as you pass, a sort of living,
                    endless panorama—shops, &amp; splendid buildings, &amp; great windows, &amp; on
                    the broad sidewalks crowds of women, richly-dressed, continually passing,
                    altogether different, superior in style &amp; looks from any to be seen any where
                    else—in fact a perfect stream of people, men too dressed in high
                    style, &amp; plenty of foreigners—&amp; then in the streets the thick crowd of
                    carriages, stages, carts, hotel &amp; private coaches, &amp; in fact all sorts of
                    vehicles &amp; many first-class teams, mile after mile, &amp; the splendor of such a
                    great street &amp; so many tall, ornamental, noble buildings, many of them of white
                    marble, &amp; the gayety &amp; motion on every side—You will not wonder how much
                    attraction all this is, on a fine day, to a great loafer like me, who enjoys so
                    much seeing the busy world move by him, &amp; exhibiting itself for his amusement,
                    while he takes it easy &amp; just looks on &amp; observes." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n0614">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0614 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0614"><span>Whitman described William Snydor as a

                    (1822–1885), commonly known as U.S. Grant, led the Union army to victory in Civil War. 
                    He generally supported Radical Republican efforts while he continued to oversee the army during the 
                    Presidency of Andrew Johnson, 1865–1868. Grant usually sided with Radical Republicans during his
                    own two consecutive terms as president, starting in 1868 and 1872. For example, he signed the Civil Rights
                    Act of 1871 into law, and he worked aggressively to beat back the rise of paramilitary groups, including the Ku Klux Klan. </span></span> [<a href="#r7b">back</a>]</li></ul>
