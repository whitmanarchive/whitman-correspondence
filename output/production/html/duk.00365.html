                  <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mother,</span>
               </span>
               <p class="tei_p">I arrived here yesterday from the Hotel De Libby and if ever a poor devil was glad to get in a Christian Country it was me.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I am perfectly well Mother although I am in the Hospital Buildings, and am not under Medical treatment. The reason that I am quartered here is that the Hotels and Boarding Houses in town are cramed full,  I stay here for one dollar and a half a day while the Hotels charge three or four dollars and we are just as comfortable as I want to be. I drew 2 months pay to day and bought a new suit of clothes and now I feel something like a white man.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I made an application this morning for a leave of absence for 30 days and I expect to be home in the course of 3 or 4 days.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">We left Danville on the 19th of this Month and stopped in Richmond untill the morning of the 22d. On our arrival at Richmond I found 2 boxes filled with Clothing and grub for me and the way we went into the eatables while we were in Libby was a caution.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Mother I am very anxious indeed to hear from you all and wish you get to write or Telagraph to me (as soon (as you get this) as possibly I may get it if you write before I leave here.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I have lots of yarns to tell you Mother but will wait untill I get home as I cant do justice to the darn Rebs, in a letter.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">You cant imagine how I want to see you and Mattie and the children and all the rest.</p>

                  <span class="tei_salute">Good Night Mother</span>
