            <p class="tei_p">Your welcome gift of money for wounded here, ($5) came safe to-day &amp; is most acceptable—Most of wounded brought up here now are without a cent—Many of the cases appeal very strongly—(I sometimes think only one going among the men as I do, with personal feeling &amp; my own way of investigation understands how deep &amp; what sort the appeal is)—the hospitals are very full—Armory Square has more inmates than many a well known New England village—I go as usual to one or another hospital &amp; to Alexandria, day &amp; night—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, I shall always be glad to hear from you—Should you find any you know who are able &amp; who feel to aid the wounded, through me, it would come <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very acceptable now</span>—sure to reach addressed</p>
