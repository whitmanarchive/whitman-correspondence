            <p class="tei_p">A paper from you last night reminds me that it is time I again reported myself. We
                are back home again &amp; I am busy about my farm work. The spring is early, the
                robins are calling the old call about the place, the sparrows are singing the old
                songs, &amp; nature seems as fresh &amp; young as ever. My plough seems<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuka_vm.00003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fuka_vm.00003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuka_vm.00003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> to find as much fat in
                the ribs of old mother Earth as ever it did &amp; it looks just as sweet. I am very
                glad to be back again, &amp; to get at some real work. On the 5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> of March I went to NY. for a week; stayed with Gilder &amp; then with Johnson; had a
                pretty good time. Saw some of the small literary fry, dined with Gilder at the
                Fellowcraft Club of which he is president, met George Kennan of
                whom I think highly, met Mrs Custer &amp; Mrs Cleveland<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuka_vm.00004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fuka_vm.00004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuka_vm.00004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                both charming women. Charles DeKay is married &amp; is stout 
                &amp; handsome. Gilder is very busy, goes out a good
                deal, but finds time to write some poetry still. He owns a house now in Clinton
                Place (8<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> st.) Walked down to City hall &amp; was
                astonished to see the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Times</span> building towering up &amp;
                quite overshadowing the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> building. Its architecture
                is fine &amp; makes the spotted &amp; clumsy character of the building of its rival
                look cheap enough.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am to have a new book this Spring, a collection of "Indoor Essays," rather a<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuka_vm.00005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fuka_vm.00005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuka_vm.00005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> piece of book-making
                business—not much worth.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are comfortable these spring days, &amp; can nearly get a glimpse of the
                spring. I am well, but not very cheerful for some reason. Any news from
                    O'Connor, or yourself will be very welcome.</p>
