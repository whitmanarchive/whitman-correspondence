                    was the sister of Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in
                    Camden. She married Joseph Browning (d. 1931). See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daybooks

                    Debbie's siblings. Walt Whitman met Harry in 1876, beginning a relationship
                    which was almost entirely overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part
                    because Stafford's name appears nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace
                    Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>—though it
                    does appear frequently in the last three volumes, which were published only in
                    the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as
                    in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H.
                    Johnston), but the relationship between the two also had a romantic, erotic
                    charge to it. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
