            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Doctor is at his desk sending you
                one of the messages you so much affect.
                There is hardly need for me to add anything. Still I wish to say how 
                much I have enjoyed all things here &amp; how much I regret to have to make
                my stay so short. We were happy today to have the three notes

                from you. They arrived one with another,—a sweet sheaf
                fm the Southward. Bless you for all the fields
                you have planted &amp; harvested for the world! What you say of
                Ingersoll's address goes home. Doctor's copy
                of that address arrived today. On Saturday I wrote Ingersoll quite a
                note—the first since the lecture—and today I 
                got good word off to Baker: a truly
                noble &amp; loving
                fellow whom you would be <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">drawn</span> to.
                I read Doctor my essay (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">N.E. Mag.</span>) Sunday night.
                He set me on my feet with certain improvements in phraseology, on the point of your
                Washington sickness. He thinks your &amp; my terminology when we get off
                on that field
                lamentable if not laughable. Bucke has a big sneer when he minds. All
                is well with us. I am in love with Ina

                &amp; Pardee. They have a more than Grecian loveliness of expression
                &amp; demeanor—a commingling of two streams, antique &amp; modern. 
                They are such hopes as lead out to America's
                biggest future. We expect to have a generous drive tomorrow if it
                is clear. The sky tonight is overclouded. The earth here is flat, but the
                heavens tumble their gorgeous
                hills without stint.
                Canada—this part of it—is the land of horizons. Doctor gave
                a talk to students today, &amp; this day I went with him to the
                dance— both times curiously instructed &amp; quieted.

                I read Symonds' negative essay today.
                After the "master" of his letters,
                this is all <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">touchy</span> &amp; resc<span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_quantity_3 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span>. He
                must come out of his dim dread to say his say before he dies. When critics will
                cease to be icebergs, authorship will get
                its dues—not before!
