            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter respecting package of books sent is at hand. I will see to 
                their distribution as named.
                Accept my thanks for your valued gift to myself of your writings. It makes life "lively" to have so 
                many attacks along with the hearty praises. The wind on both sides should enable you to steer straight.
                Miss Repplier, of
                W.Phil<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a</span> a bright member of the Contemporary Club &amp; our
                authoress has been with us this week
                bringing new accounts of you &amp; your talk at the club.

                You can take both the strokings of your fur, down &amp; up, very quietly now, without getting
                into a rage at the one or being unsettled by the other.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very sorry that you <span class="tei_supplied tei_supplied_reason_torn-away tei_hand tei_supplied_resp_smb tei_supplied_cert_high">h</span>ave to endure
                the terrible heats of our climate—but now the autumn days will bring you relief.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are spending our summer on a place we have taken on a 21 years lease, longer than our
                lease of life. It has about 180 acres—160 of it in very beautiful woods over a mile
                long &amp; full of the most delightful things. We look across a wide valley to a great 
                tract of pines in the distance.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The question is continually before me as to whether I have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right</span>
                with me in occupying so much space for private pleasures—"Its a muddle" of strange
                &amp; conflicting "rights," this our complicated civilization 
                I give myself the benefit of the doubt &amp; confusion. Mary &amp; 
                her husband &amp; guests come
                in to us to meals—Logan studies hard—recuperating in the saddle—and
                Alys makes sunshine in all the house,
                gathering many young &amp; charming guests to share her pleasures. I am fast "ageing" and find great
                delight in the beautiful forms
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00230_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00230_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00230_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                of nature around us. A vista cut through the woods gives us a western prospect—the setting sun
                in its glories. When, oh, when! will there be a vista through the perplexing obstructing
                surroundings of life to show us the eternal verities. We are both near the disrobing—where
                &amp; how will come "the clothing upon" of eternity.
                Do you feel any nearer to the solution of this than when we last talked it all over?</p>

                away but myself. Accept the kind greetings of</p>
