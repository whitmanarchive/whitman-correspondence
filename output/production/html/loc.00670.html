            <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your card and Book, some little time since was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">glad</span> to hear how you was.—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Has not Dr Bucke done grandly, splendidly, I was so much
                interested I sat up two nights till after twelve, when it first came. It is just perfect, the pictures, book,
                everything</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to have it, the pictures are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very fine</span>,—(I
                like Mr O Connor) I cant tell you Walt how much I prize the book</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hope to live to see you and have a good talk. I am writing in a hurry, Charlie was
                going down town. I took a notion all at once to send my pictures, I have <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00670.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00670.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00670.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> not been very prompt
                have I Walt about the pictures these were taken four months ago, I intended to go
                and have a full face taken, did go again to Atwoods, he was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">buisy​ </span><span class="tei_corr">busy​
        
      </span></span> these I send of his are bad are not a good likeness, Browns, look more
                like me. Charlie did not like Browns at all at first (he does not say so much
                against them now) so of course I felt disappointed. If I get a good full face I will
                send it. I am afraid these will not be very satisfactory. I dont make a good picture</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Charlie starts for the Adirondacks Monday, I have been busy getting his things all
                right. I dont know how long he will stay some weeks certainly.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt I am always so glad to hear from you, I think about you often and always I
                send you and all the rest ever and ever so much love, I am pretty well now have not
                been quite well, after all there is really <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">no</span> real
                sickness no disease the only thing about it Walt is I have fretted and worried make
                myself sick almost sometimes. I must turn over a new leaf &amp; do better</p>
