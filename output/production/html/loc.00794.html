               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter &amp; George's came safe—dear brother George, one dont more than get a letter from him before you want to hear again, especially as things are looking pretty stormy down that way—but, mother, I rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is still in Kentucky at or near where George last wrote,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> but of course that is only my guess—I send George papers often &amp; occasionally letters—mother, I sent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him, but I sent it—Mother, I think Rosecrans &amp; Burnside will be too much for the rebels down there yet—I myself make a great acc't of Burnside being in the midst of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">friends</span>, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">such</span> friends too—they will <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fight</span> &amp; fight up to the handle &amp; kill somebody—(it seems as if it was coming to that pass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I wish you would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, &amp; tell me about Andrew, if there is any thing different with him—I think about him every day &amp; night. I believe I must come home even if it is only for a week—I want to see you all very much—Mother, I know you must have a good deal to harrass &amp; trouble you, I dont mean about Andrew personally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save his, &amp; do any thing to nourish him, but about the children &amp; Nancy—but, mother, you must not let any thing chafe you, &amp; you must not be squeamish about saying firmly at times not to have little Georgy<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> too much to trouble you (poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he grows older) &amp; while you are pleasant with Nancy, you must be sufficiently plain with her—only, mother, I know you will &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat will too be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">invariably</span> good to Andrew, &amp; not mind his being irritable at times, it is his disease, &amp; then his temper is naturally fretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness, &amp; always do any thing for him that you can in reason—Mat, my dear sister, I know you will, for I know your nature is to come out a first class girl in times of trouble &amp; sickness, &amp; do any thing—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, you dont know how pleased I was to read what you wrote about little sis,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I want to see her so bad I dont know what to do, I know she must be just the best young one on Long Island—but I hope I will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to Miss Hat, nor to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle Walt I hope has heart &amp; gizzard big enough for both his little neices, &amp; as many more as the Lord may send—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office as usual—I am all alone to-day—Major is still absent, unwell, &amp; the clerk is away somewhere—O how pleasant it is here, the weather I mean, &amp; other things too for that matter—I still occupy my little room 394 L st., get my own breakfast there, had good tea this morning, &amp; some nice biscuit, (yesterday morning &amp; day before had peaches cut up)—My friends the O'Connors that I wrote about re-commenced cooking the 1st of this month, (they have been as usual in summer taking their meals at a family hotel near by.) Saturday they sent for me to breakfast &amp; Sunday I eat dinner with them, very good dinner, roast beef, lima beans, good potatoes &amp;c. They are truly friends to me—I still get my dinner at a restaurant usually. I have a very good plain dinner, which is the only meal of any acc't I make during the day, but it is just as well, for I would be in danger of getting fat on the least encouragement, &amp; I have no ambition that way.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, it is lucky I like Washington in many respects, &amp; that things are upon the whole pleasant personally, for every day of my life I see enough to make one's heart ache with sympathy &amp; anguish here in the hospitals, &amp; I do not know as I could stand it, if it was not counterbalanced outside—it is curious—when I am present at the most appaling things, deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots), I do not fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but keep singularly cool—but often, hours afterward, perhaps when I am home, or out walking alone, I feel sick &amp; actually tremble, when I recal the thing &amp; have it in my mind again before me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, did you see my letter in the N Y Times of Sunday Oct 4?<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> That was the long delayed letter—Mother, I am very sorry Jeff did not send me the Union with my letter in<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—I wish very much he would do so yet, &amp; always when I have a letter in a paper I would like to have one sent—if you take the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Union</span>, send me some once in a while—Mother, was it Will Brown sent me those? tell him if so I was much obliged, &amp; if he or Mr &amp; Mrs Brown<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> take any interest in hearing my scribblings, mother, you let 'em read the letters of course—O I must not close without telling you the highly important intelligence that I have cut my hair &amp; beard—since the event, Rosecrans, Charleston, &amp;c &amp;c have among my acquaintances been hardly mentioned, being insignificant themes in comparison—Jeff, my dearest brother, I have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or three weeks past, will try [to] do it yet, so it will reach you for Sunday reading—so good bye, brother Jeff, &amp; good by for present, Mother dear, &amp; all, &amp; tell Andrew he must not be discouraged yet—</p>

                    Page and Company, 1921), 2:29–36. This letter is typical of Whitman's
                    newspaper correspondence—chatty, discursive, and informal. Whitman
                    described the Capitol and various Washington sights; only one section, "Army
                    Wagons and Ambulances," was topical. Burroughs termed the article "one of the
                    finest pieces of writing I have ever seen" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931),
