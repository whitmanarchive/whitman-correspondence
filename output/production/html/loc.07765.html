            <p class="tei_p">Very bad night—stupid day—Horace Furness  and his
                father the old doctor (88)  here to see me this afternoon—a splendid antique,
                but looks like a cadaver tho—Horace very deaf, gets along sort o' with ear
                trumpet—both real friends of mine &amp; L of G. I sit here tiding it all over—am just taking my supper—a bit of toast
                bread &amp; rasperry jam &amp; small cup of coffee (first time in 10
                days)—</p>
