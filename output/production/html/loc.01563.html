        <span class="tei_salute">Dear loving comrade,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">As I have just been again reading your last letter to me of December 19, last, I think I
        wrote to you on receiving it, but cannot now remember for certain. Sometimes, after an
        interval, the thought of one I much love comes upon me strong &amp; full all of a
        sudden—&amp; now as I sit here by a big open window, this beautiful afternoon, every
        thing quiet &amp; sunny—I have been, &amp; am now, thinking so of you, dear young
          man,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> &amp; of your love, or more rightly speaking, our love
        for each other—so curious, so sweet, I say so <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">religious</span>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We met there in the Hospital<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—how little we have been
        together—seems to me we ought to be some together every day of our lives—I don't
        care about talking, or amusement—but just to be together, &amp; work together, or go
        off in the open air together—Now it is a long while since we have been
        together—&amp; it seems a long while since I have had a letter. Don't blame me for not
        writing oftener. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I know you would feel satisfied if you could only realize how &amp; how much I am thinking
        of you, &amp; with what great love,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> this afternoon. I can hardly
        express it in a letter<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—but I thought I would just write a
        letter this time off-hand to you, dearest soldier, only for love to you—I thought it
        might please you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new or different in my affairs. I am still working here in Atty Gens
        office—same posish—have good health—expect to bring out new editions of my books before
        very long—how is the little boy—I send my love to him, &amp; to your wife &amp;
          parents.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>

                    with this ex-soldier, see his <a href="loc.01562">April 12, 1867</a>
                    letter to Wilson. In his letter of <a href="loc.01998">December 19,
                        1869</a> Wilson reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still
                    selling melodeons and sewing machines. On <a href="loc.01999">May 15,
                        1870</a>, Wilson informed Walt Whitman of his father's death two weeks
                    earlier and related that his son "Little Walt . . . is quite a boy now . . . and
                    gets into all kinds of Mischief." Benton's father, who "was insane at times,"
                    had written to Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.02000">January 17, 1867</a>,
                    and on <a href="loc.02002">March 30, 1868</a>. Evidently Benton wrote to
                    Walt Whitman for the last time on <a href="nyp.00398">June 23, 1875</a>,
                    when he wanted to know "what I can do to contribute to your comfort and
                    happiness." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01563_n3 note" id="loc.01563_n3"><span>Originally Walt Whitman wrote "dearest

                    "How good it was that we met—I remember the times we used to sit there in
                    the Ward in Armory Square Hospital." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01563_n5 note" id="loc.01563_n5"><span>The first reading was: "with what peculiar

                    words, Walt Whitman wrote but then deleted: "O if we could only be together now
                    even if only Dear Boy, dear, dear friend, my dear solider—dear
                    comrade." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01563_n7 note" id="loc.01563_n7"><span>In 1888 Walt Whitman commented to Horace
                    Traubel about this letter: "I can't live some of my old letters over again. . .
                    . Comradeship—yes, that's the thing: getting one and one together to make
                    two—getting the twos together everywhere to make all: that's the only bond
                    we should accept and that's the only freedom we should desire: comradeship,
                    comradeship" (Horace Traubel, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
