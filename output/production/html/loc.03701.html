                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I was shown the new type so kindly given by you to Miss Grace Hunter a day or two ago, and I think it, by far, the finest I
                have seen of you in any form. I am so pleased that I write immediately to beg of you
                to reserve one for me, if it so happen you have another to spare. I leave the city
                to day for 2 or 3 months (Marlton N.J. Your friend Mr. Stafford is at the station
                there) as I am in very <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03701.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03701.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03701.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> delicate health, but will call for it, if you will allow me, on my
                return in the fall, provided of course that you are disposed to favor me so highly. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have seen Mr. Hunter two or three times daily for months—when both in the
                city—and I spent last evening with him and his daughter. He read "Eidolons"; Mr. H— several times. I am
                not prepared to say that I have arrived at its best significance as yet and intend
                giving full study. Other poems were also read and I think Mr. H is fully impressed
                he shall like them more and more as he allows a better and more familiar
                acquaintance. For myself, I have held for years that you are the greatest <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03701.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03701.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03701.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> "master of

                the fact that the prophet is so rarely duly appraised in his own country, and that

                little influence. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been begging Mr. Hunter to bring me to call with him—fearing otherwise
                I should infringe upon your time—but he is very selfish and comes by himself.
                I am sure he thinks you will get all the compliments and it is best for himself to
                leave me at home. Yet, oh yes, he is very <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very</span> good and
