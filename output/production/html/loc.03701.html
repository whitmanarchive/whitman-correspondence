            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I was shown the new type so kindly given by you to Miss Grace Hunter<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> a day or two ago, and I think it, by far, the finest I
                have seen of you in any form. I am so pleased that I write immediately to beg of you
                to reserve one for me, if it so happen you have another to spare. I leave the city
                to day for 2 or 3 months (Marlton N.J. Your friend Mr. Stafford<a href="#n0590" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0590">2</a> is at the station

                return in the fall, provided of course that you are disposed to favor me so highly. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have seen Mr. Hunter two or three times daily for months—when both in the
                city—and I spent last evening with him and his daughter. He read "Eidolons"; Mr. H— several times. I am
                not prepared to say that I have arrived at its best significance as yet and intend
                giving full study. Other poems were also read and I think Mr. H is fully impressed
                he shall like them more and more as he allows a better and more familiar
                acquaintance. For myself, I have held for years that you are the greatest <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03701.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03701.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03701.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03701.003_large.jpg</span> "master of

                little influence. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been begging Mr. Hunter to bring me to call with him—fearing otherwise
                I should infringe upon your time—but he is very selfish and comes by himself.
                I am sure he thinks you will get all the compliments and it is best for himself to
                leave me at home. Yet, oh yes, he is very <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very</span> good and

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
