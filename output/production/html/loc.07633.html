            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 12th rec'd—cheery to have such good acc'ts of the place, the weather,
                &amp; your enjoying all &amp; good condition—Rhys has had good success with
                his lectures both in NY &amp; in Phil.—has rec'd $75 for the two &amp; has made
                many friends—he leaves here to-morrow for Boston—I will see him &amp;
                tell him to write you—I rec'd a very few lines from Mrs. O'Connor dated 15th
                this morning—O'C is poorly—seems to be worse since that ill
                spell—Nothing special or new with me—bitter cold just now here, but sun
                shining to day—My little pieces continue to come out in NY Herald—(bits
                of poetry personal column)—two or three times a week—(all will appear of
                course in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov. Boughs</span>) rec'd the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Adv</span>—have frequent visitors—Morse still away
                west—the Smiths going to London early in summer—Mrs D[avis] has just
                been in to see to my coal &amp; to say we are to have apple pudding for
                dinner—it is chilly here as I finish this—my little bird sits hunch'd up
                in a lump &amp; sings not—but spring weather is coming &amp; early summer
                &amp; I will write a little poem ab't it to warm me up—</p>
