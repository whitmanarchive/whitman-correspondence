            <p class="tei_p">I have come up from White Horse, &amp; think of visiting you tomorrow Wednesday—towards the latter part of the afternoon. Will be then to supper. Have met Edward Carpenter of Brighton, England, &amp; have taken the liberty of inviting up to your house to spend a couple of hours—to be there at 6—I am keeping up well in health for me.</p>
