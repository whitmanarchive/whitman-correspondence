            <p class="tei_p">I have come up from White Horse, &amp; think of visiting you tomorrow Wednesday—towards the latter part of the afternoon. Will be then to supper. Have met Edward Carpenter of Brighton, England, &amp; have taken the liberty of inviting up to your house to spend a couple of hours—to be there at 6—I am keeping up well in health for me.</p>

                    with the Staffords from April 24 to 30, and Edward Carpenter was in Camden on
                    May 1 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Commonplace Book</span>, Charles E. Feinberg

                    Washington, D.C.). This was Whitman's first meeting with his fervid English
                    admirer (see the letter from Whitman to Edward Carpenter of <a href="tex.00345">April 23, 1876</a>). On <a href="syr.00010">March
                        1, 1877</a>, Carpenter wrote to Whitman about his intended visit: "I think
                    there are reasons <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">why we should meet</span>. . . . What must be
                    done—and what you have largely (for a foundation <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">entirely</span>) done—is to form a new organic centre for the thought
                    growth of this age. All seemed clear to me at times, so simple, so luminously
                    clear—I have no more doubt or trouble for myself—but then to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">express</span> it: that is an endless business—a thing
                    never finished." In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Days with Walt Whitman</span>, Carpenter
                    erred in dating his visit May 2 ([New York: The Macmillan Company, 1908],
                    3–4). A few days later he followed Whitman to Kirkwood, where he was
                    charmed by the poet's naturalness among the earthy Staffords. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
