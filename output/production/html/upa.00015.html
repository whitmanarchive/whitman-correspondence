                I was just able to get from Washington to her dying bed, &amp; sit there. 
                I thought I was bearing all stoutly but I find it affecting
                the progress of my recovery since, &amp; now. The doctor says my disease is really
                cerebral anaemia, resulting in paralysis. I am still feeble, palsied, &amp; have
                spells of great distress in the head—But there are favorable points—I

                much yet in flesh &amp; face, only look very old, (though that is nothing new.)

                six months, have I thought of you
                &amp; your children—Many times indeed have I been going to write, but did not.
                I have just been reading over again several of this &amp; last year's letters from
                you, &amp; looking at the pictures<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> sent in the one of January 24, '72. The letters

                other, &amp; may-be two—all came safe. Do not think hard of me for not
                writing oftener, especially the last seven months—If you could look into my
                spirit &amp; emotions you would be entirely satisfied &amp; at peace. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am at present temporarily here at Camden, on the Delaware river, immediately
                opposite Philadelphia, at the house of my brother.<a href="#n0700b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0700b">9</a> I am occupying the rooms where my

                situated as can be—And many things—indeed every thing,—in my case
                might be so much worse. Though my plans depend on yet uncertain results, my
                intention, as far as any thing, is, on getting stronger, &amp; after the hot season
                passes, to get back to Washington for the fall &amp; winter. My post office address
                continues there, (Solicitor's Office Treasury.) I send my love to Percy,<a href="#n2000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2000">10</a> &amp; all

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
