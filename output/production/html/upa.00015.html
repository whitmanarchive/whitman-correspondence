            <p class="tei_p">I must write you a few lines dear loving friend once
                more at any rate. Since I last wrote clouds have darkened over me, &amp; still
                remain. On the night of 23d of January last I was paralyzed, 
                left side, &amp; have remained so since. February 19th I lost a dear sister,
                who died in St. Louis, leaving two young daughters. May 23<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span> 
                my inexpressibly beloved mother died in Camden. 
                I was just able to get from Washington to her dying bed, &amp; sit there. 
                I thought I was bearing all stoutly but I find it affecting
                the progress of my recovery since, &amp; now. The doctor says my disease is really
                cerebral anaemia, resulting in paralysis. I am still feeble, palsied, &amp; have
                spells of great distress in the head—But there are favorable points—I
                am up &amp; dressed every day, sleep &amp; eat middling well, &amp; do not change
                much yet in flesh &amp; face, only look very old, (though that is nothing new.)
                Though I move slowly very short distances, I walk with difficulty, &amp; have to
                remain in or near the house. I think the probabilities are quite strong 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">yet that I shall get well, (though I may not.) </span></p>

                six months, have I thought of you
                &amp; your children—Many times indeed have I been going to write, but did not.
                I have just been reading over again several of this &amp; last year's letters from
                you, &amp; looking at the pictures sent in the one of January 24, '72. The letters
                of Jan 24, June 3, &amp; July 11, of '72, &amp; of Jan
                31 &amp; May 20, this year—with certainly one
                other, &amp; may-be two—all came safe. Do not think hard of me for not
                writing oftener, especially the last seven months—If you could look into my
                spirit &amp; emotions you would be entirely satisfied &amp; at peace. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am at present temporarily here at Camden, on the Delaware river, immediately
                opposite Philadelphia, at the house of my brother. I am occupying the rooms where my
                mother died—every object of furniture &amp;c. is familiar &amp; has an
                emotional history. You must not be unhappy about me, for I am as comfortably
                situated as can be—And many things—indeed every thing,—in my case
                might be so much worse. Though my plans depend on yet uncertain results, my
                intention, as far as any thing, is, on getting stronger, &amp; after the hot season
                passes, to get back to Washington for the fall &amp; winter. My post office address
                continues there, (Solicitor's Office Treasury.) I send my love to Percy, &amp; all
                your dear children. The enclosed ring I have just taken from my finger &amp; send
                you with my love.</p>
