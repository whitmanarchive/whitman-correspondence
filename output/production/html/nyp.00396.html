                   during the American Civil War. He was the son of William H.
                    Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
                    his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s <a href="nyp.00157">January 9, 1864</a>,
                    letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H
                    Millis co E 8th Penn Cav. Gen Gregg's old reg. Bridgeville Sussex co Del bed 33
                    Ward B May 8th '64 / g s w in Chest—w in left arm father living in
                    Bridgeville Del" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">NUPM</span> 2:728). Millis Jr. first wrote to
                    Whitman on <a href="nyp.00176">January 12, 1865</a>, thanking him for his
                    letter (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find
                    words to tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live
                    to meet again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere
                    there is no more parting." Millis, Jr. later moved to Delaware, where he 
                    worked for many years at the plant of the American Car and Foundry Company ("Old Soldier Dies,"

                    Whitman, it is evident that the two corresponded off and on between the years
                    of 1863 and 1875. Although Millis Jr. made no note of any recently
                    received communication from Whitman in this letter, he reported in 
                    his letter of <a href="nyp.00395">February 25, 1875</a>, that he had
                    received a letter, picture, and paper from Whitman ahead of his response to
