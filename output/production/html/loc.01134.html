Since I have been here I have written an article on Nature &amp; the Poets, showing when our poets trip on their wood lore &amp; natural history, &amp; where they hit the mark. I catch them all napping. Emerson, Bryant, Whittier, Longfellow, &amp;c. I shall have something to say about you, with extracts, but I cannot catch you in any mistake, as I wish I could, for that is my game. I wish I could also find a slip in Shakspeare, or Tennyson, but I cannot according to my knowledge except where Shakspear follows the unscientific thought of his times, as in his treatment of the honey bee.</p>

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
                    Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
                    volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>

                    (1807–1882) was both a highly popular and highly respected American poet.

                    poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
                    manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
                    not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman

                    (1819–1891), one of Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, was committed
                    to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with Whitman's more
                    experimental form. Still, as editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic
                        Monthly</span>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at Ralph
                    Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham Lincoln
                    titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
