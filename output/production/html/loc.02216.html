                    nine new members, in the July 19, 1890, issue (pp. 33–34). Whitman was on
                    the original list published in 1884, with the twentieth highest number of votes,
                    just below William Dwight Whitney and just above Asa Gray (Oliver Wendell Holmes
                    came in first, closely followed by James Russell Lowell and John Greenleaf
                    Whittier). The article prints the new "Forty Immortals" list, with the nine
                    deceased members replaced by newly appointed authors and concludes by noting
                    that only three of the immortals failed to vote: George Bancroft (because he
                    "was in too feeble a condition"), Henry James (for "unaccounted" reasons), and
                    Whitman ( "who is a disbeliever in 'close corporations')." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
