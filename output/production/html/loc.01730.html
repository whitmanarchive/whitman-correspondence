                <p class="tei_p">I have written so many letters to you dictated by Charles that I feel a painful pleasure in commencing this to you at
                    this time—knowing that his voice is silent, &amp; that no pleasant message can
                    come from his lips to you. It is useless for me to tell you how strong his
                    affection was for you, &amp; how he has looked forward to you coming to <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_place"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New Hampshire​ ">NH</span>​ </span>. I think after your visit to him that his hold on life
                    seemed to give way and his yearnings were all accomplished. There was a
                    gentleman Mr John Matthew who was very kind to him once <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01730.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01730.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01730.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01730.002.jpg</span>in <span class="tei_name tei_name_type_place">New

                    but he put it off for some reason, &amp; he was the only one of all his friends.
                    His exit was peaceful, no struggles, a gradual giving way. He used to say—"I
                    don't believe I can die" when his sufferings were so great—it seemed as if his
                    release would never come—and although I thought he was likely to die any
                    time, still I find I was unprepared for his departure &amp; my ambition &amp;
                    hopes are all crushed. I am feeling most keenly the desolation of widowhood. I
                    look at my three children &amp; think what a work I have got
                    left to perform. The duty of

                    protracted sickness exhausting the little he had laid by. I hope I may realize a little from the sale of pictures. I want to
                    ask you if you could at the distance I live assist me to get some writing or
                    copying to do. I thought you if anyone might know of something, &amp; you could
                    perhaps make inquiries—that might lead to my getting some business of that kind—I wish I might. Mr Townsend a dear friend of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">​ </span></span> has sent you a paper with a pleasant article written by
                    himself. I hope you have re<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> it. I am intending to visit New York soon

                    was Masonic and largely attended &amp; the ceremony at the grave was very
                    impressive. My Mother from Massachusetts is with me
                    for a few days and it is a great comfort.</p>
