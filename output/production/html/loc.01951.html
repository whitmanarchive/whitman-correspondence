                    born in New York; he was the son of John G. Sutherland (b. 1798), a farmer, 
                    and Anna (Anny) Sutherland (1807–1880). Byron Sutherland was a Union soldier during the 
                    U. S. Civil War, and he served in the 145th Pennsylvania Infantry. He met
                    Whitman in Washington, D. C., and the two began corresponding on <a href="sjs.00001">August 26, 1865</a>. 
                    Sutherland did farm work in Pennsylvania after the Civil War, and he also 
                    studied law and teaching (among other subjects) at the State Normal School in Erie County, Pennsylvania. 
                    In April 1870, Sutherland was teaching in Jamestown, New York. In reply to 
                    Whitman's request for further information about his life, the former soldier
                    observed on <a href="loc.01954">April 8, 1870</a>: "You remember me in
                    1865 a green vain (?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge
                    of the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
                    myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study . . . My life since we
                    parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
                    little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not so
                    pure or trusting—that the world isint quite so fair and beautiful as it
                    seemed then—That the world is not precisely a green pasture for
                    unsophistocated human lambs to skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work
                    or excitement better—That I have lost a great deal of Ambition, and gained
                    a like quantity of stupidity—That I dont know nearly so much as I once
                    supposed I did." By 1877, Sutherland had moved to Minnesota, where he married
                Sarah Raymond Brown Peck (1848–after 1915?), practiced law, and worked as a farmer. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n0595">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n0595 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n0595"><span>The State Normal School in
