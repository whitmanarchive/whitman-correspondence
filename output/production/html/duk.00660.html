      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">There is nothing particular for me to write about. I am well as usual, and getting along
        all right, except the hot weather. That continues here without much let up—Mother, I
        hope the things have arrived by this time, &amp; that you have got your bed fixed. I have
        had a visitor to–day &amp; yesterday, a young Hungarian gentleman, quite agreeable,
        talks English well, quite a traveler—went over to the White House with him yesterday,
        &amp; went all through—the President &amp; family are away, but Gen. Dent<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> conducted us through, &amp; was very polite. Mrs. O'Connor<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> made me a call Saturday, &amp; John Burroughs
        to–day—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, as soon as I hear from you, I will write more particular about my coming to
        Camden for a day or two.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Mother, I shall probably send the order
        in my next.</p>
