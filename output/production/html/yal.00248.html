            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Supposing you may receive this Monday morning, I feel to say to you &amp; Mrs. J.
                &amp; all the childer too, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Happy new year, for the first
                    thing</span>—&amp; you take this home to Mrs. J to read the printed letter
                on the other side—(it is one I sent to Rossetti in London, &amp; he had some
                copies printed as a sort of circular)—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The watch came last evening, &amp; I received
                and examined it this forenoon—I think it is going to do just
                right—thanks—very cold here, the gale whistling &amp; blowing about the
                house, as I write—but the sun shining bright enough. Note in the box rec'd
                &amp; welcomed—I am feeling quite well for me—If you see J Miller tell
                him <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I like much</span> his piece to me in the January
                Galaxy—it is full of the fieriest horses,
                held well in hand—tell him to write to me—I shall send you a newspaper
                to-morrow with some little poems to me extracted, Miller's among them—When you
                read it &amp; are through, give it to J M—</p>
