                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    this letter on the back of the circular he references. William Michael Rossetti had made some copies printed of a March 17, 1876, letter that
                    Whitman had sent, and Whitman intended this printed copy as an enclosure for
                    Alma Calder Johnston, the wife of John H. Johnston. Whitman had sent 
                    the original letter to Rossetti on <a href="pri.00016">March 17,

                    whom Whitman met in 1876, or for Edward Cattell, a hired hand at the Stafford
                    family's New Jersey farm, who became close to Whitman. See the letter from

                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
