                am quite poorly &amp; it has been such hot weather—I am quite concerned about
                him &amp; w'd wish to help somehow—If you w'd wish a little money I can let
                you have it, as I can spare it—or if there is any thing George would like that
                I c'd get up here, you write me, &amp; it w'd be a pleasure to me to get it—I
                send George my love &amp; the same to you all—</p>
