                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy &amp; comrade,
                </span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">It is a long while since I have written to you—I believe it is six months, or over—but you must not think I have forgotten you—I have thought of you often, &amp; wished we could be together.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Al, I believe the last letter I got from you was last April. I went home about that time to Brooklyn, N. Y., 
                &amp; remained home quite a long time—one of my brothers, (who had been a soldier &amp; all through the war, 
                in the 9th Corps,) was sick with erysipelas, &amp; lay very low for a while—but has recovered. My Mother, &amp; the rest of the folks, are all well. I have had good health since 
                I last wrote to you. I am still working in the Attorney General's Office, here—I am writing this letter at my desk in the office, seated by the same old open window, where I can look out 
                &amp; have a splendid view of the Potomac river, &amp; the hills &amp; trees &amp; banks, for miles &amp; miles. 
                It looks pleasant enough—but we are having it very hot indeed, just now—last night was very oppressive—then the air is so close &amp; stale in the city in hot weather any how—I sometimes feel as I could hardly breathe.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Alfred, I suppose you read in the papers about the trial of John H. Surratt 
                for taking part in the murder of President Lincoln. I went down to the trial, day before yesterday. 
                Surratt is very young—I sat near him &amp; looked at him a long time—he sits most of the time fanning himself 
                with a big palm leaf fan, &amp; watches the witnesses with his sharp eyes—&amp; his brother, a young farmer-looking man 
                from Texas, sits close by him. The lawyers on both sides are very smart—sometimes the evidence goes strongly against him, 
                &amp; then again for him. It is very interesting to sit &amp; hear the witnesses &amp; the speeches of the lawyers. 
                It has been a tedious trial, &amp; it is hard to tell how it will end.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Al, you mentioned about your father buying a new farm, last spring. You must tell me how it goes—&amp; also how you are getting along yourself, for I want to hear every thing, &amp; all the particulars about you.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Tell your father &amp; mother I would write to them, but I suppose writing to you is almost the same. 
                I send them my love, &amp; a full share to you, dearest comrade. My address is the same 
                as you directed your former letters. Well, I must draw to a close. Alfred, your love for me, 
                &amp; the kind invitations you have sent me, &amp; from the kind father &amp; mother also, to come 
                &amp; pay you all a visit, are fully appreciated by me. I hope &amp; intend to come &amp; see you all, 
                one of these days. Write &amp; let me know if you get this. Farewell, my darling boy, 
                &amp; God bless you, &amp; bless the dear parents also.
            </p>
