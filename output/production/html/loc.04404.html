                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">In no less familiar or colder terms can we bring ourselves to address you, the most
                loved of friends, though such a salutation from strangers to anyone but yourself
                would seem an impertinence</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We, two friends chiefly united by our common love of you, wish to congratulate you on
                your birthday and express to you personally our very best wishes and love. To you we
                owe not only affection but endless gratitude and reverence. One of us, a doctor,
                owes to you entirely his spiritual enfranchisement &amp; deliverance from
                soul-benumbing scepticism, into which, not without pain, he had gradually fallen.
                Your books are his constant companions, his spiritual nourishment, his continual
                study and delight. And not least of his debts to you is "the glory" you have shown
                him, "in his daily walk &amp; trade" which you have ennobled and made beautiful for
                him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The writer in many obstructions &amp; difficulties is strengthened and comforted by
                your example and words. In past heavy bereavement (of a mother to whom he has often
                mentally applied the words you use of yours) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> words
                have best tallied his deepest experience and hopes. For years he has been, and is, a
                lover and grateful student of Carlyle and, in turn, of
                    Ruskin. He has also, on the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01022_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01022_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01022_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> other hand been long familiar with
                    Emerson and reveres his memory. But <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> teaching, far more than Emerson's, has appealed to him as the fitting
                offset to and complement of theirs, and as a veritable "Gospel" bringing "glad
                tidings of great joy."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We both study your writings as much as possible, and glean every help that critiques
                and notices can give. We endeavor to assimilate them in our lives and try to
                introduce them to others. We occasionally call friends together in your name to
                spend "a Whitman evening", to read your books and talk about them. We shall not fail
                to do so on the 31st, and shall rejoice to believe that you know it and that there
                is a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">real</span> communion between us, though far sundered</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are anxious to have the pleasure of giving you some little tangible token of our
                love. We do not know what else to send you so venture to ask you to accept a money
                present of £10. It will be a lifelong pleasure to us to feel that we have thus been
                in personal communication with you and that something you hold has been supplied by
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hoping you will do us this favour, and wishing you long continued health and
                strength. We are,</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours gratefully and affectionately</span>
