                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    notice "very good: a very generous one" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
                        Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.58.html">Friday, December 28, 1888</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07537_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.07537_n6"><span>Bucke had written to Whitman
                    on <a href="loc.07284">December 20, 1888</a>, registering at length his
                    enthusiasm for Whitman's just-published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems and
                        Prose</span>. Whitman decided to have Bucke's letter printed for distribution
                    among his friends and disciples, and he titled it "An impromptu criticism on the
                    900 page Volume, 'The Complete Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman,' first issued
                    December, 1888." The first printing had several typos, including the addition of
                    an acute accent over the first "e" of "Goethe," so Whitman had the errors
                    corrected in a second printing that was completed by January 2, 1889. See Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07537_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.07537_n3"><span>In "An impromptu
                    criticism," Bucke wrote: "It is a gigantic massive autobiography, the first of

                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
