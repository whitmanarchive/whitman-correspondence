                upon the whole—N Y Herald 23d last Sunday has a leading (book notice) two
                third column review of Nov: Boughs, mostly extracts—favorable more than any
                thing else—glad you hit (fix) on the
                autobiographic underlying element of the collected Vol—Was wondering whether <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that</span> w'd be detected—did
                not say anything ab't it, but it has been in my mind of late y'rs
                unremittedly—of course not in the usual auto-writing style &amp; even
                purposes, but with a freer margin—&amp; I think if the book really grips, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that</span> will be what the good class literary detectives of the
                future will mainly settle &amp; agree upon—Then I sh'd be tickled enough if I
                c'd think I had indeed skimm'd some of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">real cream</span> of the
                American History of the last 35 years &amp; preserv'd it here—I have sent to
                some 20 of our friends &amp; specialists home &amp; abroad (wrapt in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Post</span> item of last Thursday) the printed copy of y'r letter
                ab't it—(the "impromptu criticism")—I send you Kennedy's letter of 25th—yr's of 26th
                came last evn'g—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yes, I shall <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">mind</span>—think I understand &amp; accept the
                matter below it, &amp; shall practically put it in action—as I finish I am
                sitting alone by my oak-fire—every thing still—&amp; the sun out shining
