                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Rosetti​ </span></span>:</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Mr. Conway has received, &amp; you have read, 
                the letter I sent over about three weeks since, 
                assenting to the substitution of other words, &amp;c. 
                as proposed by you, in your reprint of my book, or selections therefrom.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose the reprint intends to avoid any expressed or 
                implied character of being an expurgated edition. 
                I hope it will simply assume the form &amp; name of a selection 
                from the various editions of my pieces printed here. 
                I suggest, in the interest of that view, whether the 
                adjoining might not be a good form of Title page:<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish particularly not only that the little figures 
                numbering the stanzas, but also that the larger figures 
                dividing the pieces into separate passages or sections 
                be carefully followed &amp; preserved, as in copy.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">When I have my next edition brought out here, 
                I shall change the title of the piece "When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd," 
                to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn</span>.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
                You are at liberty to take the latter name, or the 
                old one, at your option, (that is, if you include the piece.)
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is quite certain that I shall add to my next edition 
                (carrying out my plan from the first,) a brief cluster 
                of pieces, born of thoughts on the deep themes of Death &amp; Immortality.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Allow me to send you an article I have written on "Democracy"—a hasty charcoal-sketch of a piece, but indicative, 
                to any one interested in Leaves of Grass, as of the audience the book supposes, 
                &amp; in whose interest it is made. I shall probably send it next mail.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Allow me also to send you (as the ocean-postage law is now so easy,) 
                a copy of Mr. Burroughs's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes</span>,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> 
                &amp; some papers. They go same mail with this.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And now, my dear sir, you must just make what use—or no use at all—of any thing I suggest or send—as your occasions call for. 
                Very likely some of my suggestions have been anticipated.
            </p>
            
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">I remain, believe me, with friendliest feelings &amp; wishes,</span>

                    <p class="tei_p">Whitman included with this letter a sketched mock-up of the proposed title

                        with thanks &amp; without a moment's debate, were it not that my own
