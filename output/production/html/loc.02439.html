            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Last evening M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Wallace 
                shewed me your post card, from which I
                was extremely sorry to learn that you had been a little uneasy about me. By this
                time you will know from his cablegram and from our letters that all is well with me
                but I regret that I did not write to you sooner or cable to you immediately upon my
                arrival. Through not doing so I feel I have been guilty of a seeming lack of
                courtesy to you. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">You</span> will need no assurance that this has
                not been intentional<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00199.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00199.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00199.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> on
                my part; for I can never forget your great kindness to me—the homely, cordial
                &amp; sponteneous reception you gave me not only to your house but into your heart which
                you seemed fairly to open to me in a way that has touched me very deeply indeed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By your loving kindness, your sympathy and your open-handed generosity you have
                enriched my life with treasures which I would not exchange for all the wealth of
                Golconda for you have given me "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">yourself</span>" as "a living
                impulse"</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">"We convince by our presence." Your presence has haunted me ever since I left you and
                at times the sense of propinquity is so strong that I find it difficult to realize
                that we are separated by more than three thousand miles!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">"What is it then between us? Whatever it is it avails not,—distance avails not,
                and place avails not."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The words of Mr Wallace that I seem to have had a spiritual 
                visitation are no exaggeration for I am conscious of having
                received a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">something</span> from you which has infused itself
                into my being and which eludes my senses and baffles my judgment to explain.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And now you crown your goodness by shewing such a sympathetic concern about my
                welfare as no other man save my own, dear, good father could have done.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">For all this and more I desire you to accept of my heartfelt thanks.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to hear that your health is fairly good &amp; I trust it may continue to
                improve now that the intensly hot weather has gone.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am taking the liberty of writing to Dr Bucke to explain my not visiting him as I
                intended. It was simply impossible for me to do so &amp; deeply do I now regret it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope Warren has received the book on "massage."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you a few photographs—the first I have done &amp; hope you will like
                them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With kindest regards to M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Davis &amp;
