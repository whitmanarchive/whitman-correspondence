            <p class="tei_p">Mr Lane has written a letter to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mr Webster</span>
               <a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> the clerk of Seward<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> that I spoke to you about and will send you a letter of introduction to him immediately. He tells me that he (Webster) is a "politician" and that he will help you without doubt provided that he thinks that it will not interfere at all with him. Or that is about the idea of what he said.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all getting well at home  Sis has almost entirely recovered  Mat's throat is still quite sore and mothers cough <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">was</span> a great deal better, till she went and caught more but she is again getting well. We do not hear any more from Heyde so I presume that Han is getting better again and perhaps will soon be home. I hope so anyway</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I hope that George may be successful in getting his furlough.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I saw Capt. Simms<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> Sunday night, he had left George and the rest on Thursday morning. He was then well and engaged in building his hut. Simms looks very well indeed. My old friend Bill DeBevoise<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> is home sick with "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">weakness</span>" I suppose you might call it. He can hardly walk alone  He has been home about 2 weeks and has got so he can just get about a little. My friend J. W. Mason,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> (used to be in my party on the Water Works) was in Brooklyn on Saturday  He was then on his way to his fathers at Towando, Pa. and promised that he would call on you when he returned to the army  He is now a Capt. in the regulars. (5th Cavalry)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think I shall take a few of your letters and give them to George Wright<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> (of the ferry) and let him see if he cannot collect a few dollars from the ferry hands  dont you think it would be a good idea. I think that he might be able to collect something quite handsome. I have not seen any of the ferry hands since you went away.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We often wish that you and George could pop in on us just as we were about to sit down to dinner, particularly when we have "Turk" as sis calls it. Mother eats with us at almost every meal and I think living well is about all that keeps her up through all the trouble and worry that she goes through, for work and worry she will and I dont think the power of man can prevent it. Mat is nearly the same as usual  she is not very well and sometimes has to give up for a little while, but she soon buckels in again. Sis of course when she is well is just as big a little scamp as ever, more mischief-making than ever, if that is possible. Jess and Ed are I guess, in every respect are just the same. I met Andrew Rome,<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a> 'tother day, he wanted to know how soon you would be in Brooklyn again  I told him I did not know and asked him to write you. How would it do for you to write to Wilke,<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">13</a> detailing what you are doing, what we have contributed so that he might strike some of the big-bugs that he moves among or shall I give him the letters that you have written to us. advise me about it</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Lane has about finished his reports and wishes me to tell you that he will now have some time to devote and thinks he will be able to raise some more money, however he will write you himself before long, a day or two.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What about your chances for the "position" and what kind of a position do you expect to get. I sincerely hope that you might succeed and get detailed to New York.<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">14</a> Try for it Walt and dont be discouraged if you do not succeed at first</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Do you write to dear brother George often, I wish he could honorably get out of it. Would'nt it be good if he was home just now to build my "house"  I should like much to have it done by him, let him get a gang of men and pay him by the day. However I suppose it cannot be done in that manner and shall have to do it in some other.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt let me hear from you soon. All send their love to you and receive my best wishes for your health and success  I remain as ever your affectionate brother</p>

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27,
                        1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in
                    the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman
                    wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of
                    money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
                    (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
                    Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00398_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00398_n5"><span>For Lane's letter to E.

                    captain in George's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment, had been the

                    appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, on January 5, 1863.
                    Sims died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia (see
                    George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from <a href="duk.00359">August 9, 1864</a>). Walt Whitman may have lived in
                    Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
                    Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
                    brother's name in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> listed among the
                    wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
                    George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
                        <a href="duk.00333">December 16, 1862</a>: "I have come out safe and
