                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    in his Commonplace Book: "Am writing this in my new premises in Mickle
                    Street—slept here last night—the plumbers are here at work at gas
                    &amp; water fixings, &amp; the carpenter—Mr and Mrs Lay" (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.). On April 3 he "paid $1750 cash for the premises
                    328 Mickle Street, Camden, to Rebecca Jane Hare, &amp; took the deed, which I
                    left at the Register's office to be recorded" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).
                    Whitman had royalties from the Philadelphia editions amounting to $1250, and
                    he borrowed $500 from George W. Childs (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.73.html">Saturday, June 9, 1888</a>). The bill of sale, in Whitman's hand, is in
                    the Walt Whitman House at Camden: "Camden, March 19, 1884, Received Sixteen
                    dollars from Mrs: Lay, the rent in advance for house in Mickle St.—It is
                    understood that if Mr Whitman before the end of April buys the house, this
                    $16 is to be deducted from the price $1800. | R Jennie Hare." | "I agree
                    to sell Walt Whitman the premises 328 Mickle Street for Seventeen Hundred and
                    Fifty Dollars cash instead of 1800 dollars. | R Jenne Hare." <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Howe's Camden City Directory</span> for 1883 listed as the occupant at 328
                    Mickle Street Mrs. Ellen Hare, a dressmaker and a widow. No mention of "R
                    Jennie" or "Rebecca Jane" appears in the directories in the 1880s. On March 23
                    Whitman handed his sister-in-law a "rough statement" of the sums paid to her for
                    board from June, 1873, to March, 1884, a period of 560 weeks, during which time
                    he was not in Camden for 143 weeks. The total paid was $1501—"ab't
                    $3.60 a week for the time boarded" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
