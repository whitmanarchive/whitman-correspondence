        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Charley,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am getting along favorably—looking on the sunny side of the case, I am
        probably better now than at any time since I was paralyzed—(though bad enough
        yet.) My improvement is not much in the head troubles, &amp; hardly any in my left
        leg, but very perceptible in my strength &amp; vim
        generally—&amp;
        my confidence remains (still unaffected in the main, by all the tediousness of hope
        deferred again &amp; again) that, for all I am in the woods yet, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I
          shall emerge</span> &amp; see light again. It was <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">to
          Harpers</span> I sold at handsome prices my pieces—(I sent a second one
        which, like the first, they took, at my own price at once &amp; sent me the
        money)—They are in type, and I have read the proofs. So they are off my mind.
        One is called "Song of the Redwood tree," (California) &amp; one the "Prayer of
        Columbus"—When they will appear I don't know, but suppose soon—take
        this to Nelly. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, my dear, I received your welcome letter last evening. I am waiting for the
        photos of my St. Louis Nieces to be returned from an old grand-aunt of mine (92
        years old),<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> mother's mother's sister, who wanted to see them in N.Y., &amp; then I will
        send them to you. I spent Christmas alone here, as my brother and sister had gone
        down for three days on a visit to Delaware—I am in good heart. We shall yet
        meet, Nelly dear. </p>

        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt</span>
      </span>

      
        <p class="tei_p">I send a P.O. Order for $30. for Godey—I sent him $20 on the 23rd.
        </p>
