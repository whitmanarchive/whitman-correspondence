                    York in the early 1870s and worked as a dealer in real estate. According to the 1880 United States 
                    Federal Census, Morrison had moved back to Pennsylvania with his wife Phebe Tripp Sherman Morrison 
                    (1838–1912) and their four children. His occupation is listed as "oil operator." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00702_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00702_n1"><span>Morrison had written to
