                    Sea-Storm" (later called "Proud Music of the Storm"), which James T. Fields
                    (1817–1881), editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>,
                    promptly accepted for the magazine. After Emerson, who had received "Proud Music
                    of the Sea-Storm" in Whitman's <a href="dar.00004">November 30, 1868</a>
                    letter, delivered the poem to Fields, Fields sent $100 to Whitman on <a href="loc.01614">December 5, 1868</a>. He informed Whitman on <a href="loc.01615">December 14, 1868</a> that if he was to get the poem
                    into the February issue it would be impossible to send proof to Washington. <a href="per.00014">"Proud Music of the Sea-Storm"</a> did, however, appear
                    in the February 1869 issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> and
                    was the second of Whitman's poems to appear in the magazine; <a href="per.00033">"Bardic Symbols"</a> was published in 1860. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
