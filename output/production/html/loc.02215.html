               poet, satirist and statesman.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Should you care to make the tribute a
                more memorable one by adding your congratulations to those of the other distinguished
                men and women whose names will appear in this special number, we should esteem it a

                will surprise as much as it must please him.</p>

                    (1819–1891) was an American critic, poet and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic</span>. One of Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, Lowell
                    was committed to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with
                    Whitman's more experimental form. Still, as editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at
                    Ralph Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham
                    Lincoln titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
                    contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
