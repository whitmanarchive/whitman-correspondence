                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Emerson:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">On the eve of sending the enclosed piece abroad, I have taken a notion to first offer it to 
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span>—and, if not too great a liberty, to solicit your services for that purpose.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I would be much obliged if you would take it in to Mr. Fields the first time you go to Boston—show him this letter—If available at all, I propose it for about the February number of the magazine. 
                The price is $100, &amp; 30 copies of the number in which it may be printed—and I will ask Mr. Fields 
                to do me the favor to send me an answer within a week from the time he receives the piece—or perhaps he can give his decision at once on receiving it.</p>
            
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">With best respect &amp; love,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman.</span>
            </span>
            
            
                <p class="tei_p">The piece appears in printed form because I have had it put in type for my own convenience, 
                    and to insure greater correctness—I forgot to say, above, that I scrupulously reserve the 
                    right to print this piece in future in my book—(which, however, will not be for several months.)
                </p>
                    <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">W. W.</p>
