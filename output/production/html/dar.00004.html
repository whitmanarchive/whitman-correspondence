            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">On the eve of sending the enclosed piece<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> abroad, I have taken a notion to first offer it to 
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span>—and, if not too great a liberty, to solicit your services for that purpose.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I would be much obliged if you would take it in to Mr. Fields<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> the first time you go to Boston—show him this letter—If available at all, I propose it for about the February number of the magazine. 
                The price is $100, &amp; 30 copies of the number in which it may be printed—and I will ask Mr. Fields 
                to do me the favor to send me an answer within a week from the time he receives the piece—or perhaps he can give his decision at once on receiving it.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>
            
            <span class="tei_closer">

                <p class="tei_p">The piece appears in printed form because I have had it put in type for my own convenience, 
                    and to insure greater correctness—I forgot to say, above, that I scrupulously reserve the 
                    right to print this piece in future in my book—(which, however, will not be for several months.)

                    <p class="tei_p">In 1888 Horace Traubel asked Whitman why he had appealed "to Emerson as a
                        mediator": "For several reasons, I may say. But the best reason I had was in
                        his own suggestion that I should permit him to do such things for me when
                        the moment seemed ripe for it" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.6.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996],

                    him, Fields sent $100 to Whitman on <a href="loc.01614">December 5,
