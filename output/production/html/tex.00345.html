      <p class="tei_p">I have rec'd the P.O. money order, &amp; the money (£4—$21.97) has been paid me—for which
        accept warmest thanks.—No letter has yet reached me, specifying an order for my books,
        new edition—but if one does not come in a few days, I believe I will send the Two
        Vols. to same address as this note—As, I take it, that will be agreeable to you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am middling comfortable these times—Again thanks—</p>

                    Englishmen, Carpenter (1844–1929) deemed Walt Whitman a prophetic
                    spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of brotherhood. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Walt
                    Whitman: "Because you have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I
                    thank you continually in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not
                    ashamed of the noblest instinct of their nature." On <a href="loc.01230">January 3, 1876</a>, Carpenter sent another impassioned letter. On <a href="loc.01232">April 8, 1876</a>, he sent £4 for the 1876 volumes. See
                    also Whitman's <a href="upa.00027">May 1, 1877</a> letter to Anne
                    Gilchrist. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
