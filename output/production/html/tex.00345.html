      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have rec'd the P.O. money order, &amp; the money (£4—$21.97) has been paid me—for which
        accept warmest thanks.—No letter has yet reached me, specifying an order for my books,
        new edition—but if one does not come in a few days, I believe I will send the Two
        Vols. to same address as this note—As, I take it, that will be agreeable to you. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am middling comfortable these times—Again thanks—</p>
