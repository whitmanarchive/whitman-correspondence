            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks for thy card of the 3rd which came on Saturday, just too late for me to
                catch the return mail. I am afraid by a curious fatality all thy biographers want to
                make thee out <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">too good</span> for thy liking! Has thee never
                thought of expanding the Specimen Days into Autobiographical sketches? Then thee
                could tell the world thy wickedness to the full, which <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> thy friends are so
                uncomprehending as not to see! I wonder if thee knows Mr. Norman personally? He is
                a charming fellow, very clever and full of American pluck. He is always so busy that
                one seldom gets a chance of seeing him in the seething side of affairs in this great
                city, but I am going to make my husband look him up again, now that I know he is a
                friend of thine. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have had nothing here but a succession of thick fogs, and today when I saw the
                flush of the real sun in the sky, I thought it was a fire!
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                In pursuance of the course of reading I wrote to thee about, I have begun to take
                Greek lessons and to read Plato's Republic. In our spare moments (which are alas!
                none too many) we are working out our idea of the ideal State, as a sort of
                supplement and corrective to Socialism. But life rushes along too fast here to give
                one time for many wayside reflections, I am afraid, and too often I find whole days
                filled up with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">things</span>—thoughts being crowded out.
                Perhaps it is good to live an intensely practical life for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> a while. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very grateful for thy little slip anent Tennyson's latest, although I don't
                agree with it at all. Tennyson struck me as a man great <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in
                    spots</span>, and the cracks filled in with inferior stuff. I think this latest
                outburst of cynical pessimism comes from one of the gaps in the greatness of his
                nature. Perhaps thee will think this the hasty &amp; impulsive judgment of youth. I
                will begin to reconsider it when I find thee issuing a latest edition of Leaves of
                Grass with all the optimism <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and faith and kindliness left out. I should have been glad to die
                before I had left <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">such</span> a message as my last utterance, the
                final outcome of a long life of experience and thought. I can't join with thee in
                thanking him for his "Sixty Years After"! I judge people by different standards from
                those which one uses towards Nature, for I think the gulf between natural evolution
                &amp; moral responsibility is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">infinite</span>, and if the present
                poems of Tennyson are the result of his point of view all along, then I think he is
                responsible for taking such a point of view <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">&amp; for</span><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> working it out to this
                disheartening issue.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I am disobeying my doctor, who has forbidden long letters for the present. It is
                always a temptation to chat with thee—I only wish I were near enough to do it
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">really</span>. Thee can't think what a refreshment to soul
                and body it is to read Leaves of Grass, or even to think of thee, in the midst of
                this artificial town life. I hope thee is well and cheerful; I am always silently
                sending thee good wishes across the ocean. </p>
