            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks for thy card of the 3rd which came on Saturday, just too late for me to
                catch the return mail. I am afraid by a curious fatality all thy biographers want to
                make thee out <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">too good</span> for thy liking! Has thee never
                thought of expanding the Specimen Days into Autobiographical sketches? Then thee
                could tell the world thy wickedness to the full, which <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01360.002_large.jpg</span> thy friends are so
                uncomprehending as not to see! I wonder if thee knows Mr. Norman personally? He is
                a charming fellow, very clever and full of American pluck. He is always so busy that
                one seldom gets a chance of seeing him in the seething side of affairs in this great
                city, but I am going to make my husband look him up again, now that I know he is a
                friend of thine. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have had nothing here but a succession of thick fogs, and today when I saw the
                flush of the real sun in the sky, I thought it was a fire!

                In pursuance of the course of reading I wrote to thee about, I have begun to take
                Greek lessons and to read Plato's Republic. In our spare moments (which are alas!
                none too many) we are working out our idea of the ideal State, as a sort of
                supplement and corrective to Socialism. But life rushes along too fast here to give
                one time for many wayside reflections, I am afraid, and too often I find whole days
                filled up with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">things</span>—thoughts being crowded out.
                Perhaps it is good to live an intensely practical life for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01360.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01360.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01360.004_large.jpg</span> a while. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very grateful for thy little slip anent Tennyson's latest, although I don't
                agree with it at all. Tennyson struck me as a man great <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in
                    spots</span>, and the cracks filled in with inferior stuff. I think this latest
                outburst of cynical pessimism comes from one of the gaps in the greatness of his
                nature. Perhaps thee will think this the hasty &amp; impulsive judgment of youth. I
                will begin to reconsider it when I find thee issuing a latest edition of Leaves of

                and body it is to read Leaves of Grass, or even to think of thee, in the midst of
                this artificial town life. I hope thee is well and cheerful; I am always silently
                sending thee good wishes across the ocean. </p>

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
