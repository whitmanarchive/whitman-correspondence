                    (1847–1911) was an Ohio-born patent and estate attorney in Chicago,
                    Illinois. The book Roberts sent Whitman was likely his only novel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Down the O-hi-o</span> (Chicago: A. C. McClurg, 1891), centering
                    on the Quakers of Southwestern Ohio and the underground railroad. According to a
                    review in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chicago Tribune</span>, "the author has made a
                    careful study of the Quaker and his ways" (vol. 60 no. 73 [March 14 1891], 12).
                    Roberts was working as an editor at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cairo Bulletin</span>
                    when he died in 1911. For more information, see "Charles H.

                    about a Camden Ferry ride with Whitman during the centennial year of 1876.
                    Riding this ferry had become a frequent, beloved activity of Whitman's since his
                    move to Camden in 1873. See Whitman's letter to Susan Stafford on <a href="loc.04665">September 10, 1882</a> in which Whitman describes the
                    profound connection he had to riding the ferry: "I don't know what I should do
                    without the ferry, &amp; river, &amp; crossing, day &amp; night—I believe
                    my best times are nights—sometimes appear to have the river &amp; boat all

                    (1835–1894) was an American poet and short story writer. The daughter of a
                    Maine lighthouse keeper and hotelier, Thaxter's stories are often set in the
                    American northeast and feature the Atlantic Ocean. Her works include <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Among the Isles of Shoals</span> (Boston: James R. Osgood and

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
