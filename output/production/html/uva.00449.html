                    Commonplace Book, Whitman sent the two books on August 2, but the postmark is
                    clearly August 21 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Perhaps there was a
                    delay in mailing because Whitman was staying with Smith in Germantown. In a
                    letter to Professor Rollo G. Silver in 1934, Pease wrote: "I called on W. W. in
                    Camden in the winter (i.e. November or December) of 1888. He was ill in bed,
                    &amp; I was only allowed to see him for 5 minutes. He was living in what my
                    memory pictures as almost a slum, &amp; his bedroom was not exactly tidy. He
                    spoke of the devotion of Americans to the worship of the dollar, which surprised
                    me, as his usual attitude in his writings is patriotic, &amp; laudatory of his
                    compatriots." See also the letter from Whitman to Elizabeth &amp; Isabella Ford
                    and Edward R. Pease of <a href="bol.00001">May 28, 1884</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
