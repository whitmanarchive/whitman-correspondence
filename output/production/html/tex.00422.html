            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you rec'd the copy yesterday (Saturday) as I sent it the previous day. You
                already have my plan—a volume of say 400 pages, (not over 450) handy size,
                first class (but I know you wouldn't issue any other) in paper, print, binding
                &amp;c: but markedly plain &amp; simple even to Quakerness—I have a desire
                that all through even in capitalization, punctuation &amp;c it shall be so—no
                sensationalism or luxury—a well made book for honest wear &amp; use &amp;
                carrying with you—to retail at $3—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The book has not hitherto been really <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">published</span> at
                all—the issues have been <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">reconnoisances</span>—printings
                in proof for zealous friends &amp;c.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The British market is an important consideration.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The copy I sent will have to be returned before very long to me, for complete minor
                &amp; technical revision, as I did not wait to finish it after receiving your last
                letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I reserve any thing further until I hear your definite decision on the main
                point—the publication<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>

                    on <a href="loc.05158">May 31</a> that the firm would be "glad to publish
                    the book" and proposed a royalty of ten per cent. Again he inquired about
                    Worthington's pirated books: "We should like to feel clear that you can control
                    the old Thayer &amp; Eldridge plates, so as to stop the issue of any books
                    printed from them" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span>
                    [New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:278–279). Osgood returned
                    Whitman's copy at the same time, and enclosed a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Our
                        Poetical Favorites</span> as a sample of what the firm proposed to do with
