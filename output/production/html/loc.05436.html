                <span class="tei_salute">My friend,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Why the dickins didn't you come out to the whig meeting at the court house, last
                Saturday week?—I went there, with the hope of seeing you and one or two
                others, as much as for any thing else.—I dare say you would have been much
                gratified; at any rate you would have been astonished, for the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">orator</span> of the day related <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">facts</span>, and cut capers,
                which certainly never before met the eye or ear of civilised man.—Just before
                sundown the performance concluded, and starting from the C. H. I was overtaken by a
                most impertinent shower, which drenched me to the skin; probably all the whig
                enthusiasm generated on that occasion was melted down again by this unlucky shower,
                for we passed loads of forlorn gentlemen, with draggle-tailed coats,
                crest-fallen hats, and sour-looking phizzes.—The mighty patriotism
                they felt was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">drowned</span> by a tormenting slipperiness of
                coat, shirt, and pantaloons.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Were you ever tried?—I don't mean tried before Squire Searing<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">2</a> or Judge Strong<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">3</a>
                for breach of promise or theft; but tried as they try mutton fat, to make candles

                stake?—If you havn't—I have.—The scene was "Huckleberry plains,"
                The Day Friday last—the time, from twelve o'clock, M. until 3½
                P.M.—You see I'm particular.—The awful occasion impressed indeliby upon
                my memory every agonising moment of that infernal excursion. It was what the ladies
                and gentlemen of this truly refined place called a party of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pleasure</span>.—Yes; it was delightful; fun to the back-bone: but it
                cost me a sun-burnt face and neck, from which the skin is even now peeling,
                and four mortal pounds of flesh which ran off in a state of dilution from my
                body.—The sun poured down whole lumps of red hot fire—not a tree not a
                shed to shelter us from the intolerable glare.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I gave you in my last some account<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> of my first "huckleberry frolick," but this beats
                it all hollow.—I can only wonder why I was such a thundering fool as to try it
                again.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How are you all in Jamaica?—What is the news?—Do you have any games at
                Twenty Questions?—Does "our portrait" yet remain in the condition of the
                southern banks?—O, how I wish I was among you for a few hours: how tired and
                sick I am of this wretched, wretched hole!—I wander about like an evil spirit,
                over hills <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01467_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gk.01467_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01467_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_gk.01467_large.jpg</span> and
                dales, and through woods, fields, and swamps. In the manufactory of Nature, the
                building of these coarse gump-heads that people Woodbury, must have been given
                to some raw hand; for surely no decent workman ever had the making of
                them.—And these are the contemptible ninnies, with whom I have to do, and
                among whom I have to live.—O, damnation, damnation! thy other name is
                school-teaching and thy residence Woodbury.—Time, put spurs to thy
                leaden wings, and bring on the period when my allotted time of torment here shall be
                fulfilled.—Speed, ye airy hours, lift me from this earthly purgatory; nor do I
                care how soon ye lay these pudding-brained bog-trotters, amid their
                kindred earth.—I do not believe a refined or generous idea was ever born in
                this place; the whole concern, with all its indwellers, ought to be sunk, as Mosher<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">5</a>
                says, "to chaos." Never before have I entertained so low an idea of the beauty and
                perfection of man's nature, never have I seen humanity in so degraded a shape, as
                here.—Ignorance, vulgarity, rudeness, conceit, and dulness are the reigning
                gods of this deuced sink of despair.—The brutes go barefoot, shave once in
                three weeks, call "brown cow" <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"brown ke-ow"</span>; live on sour
                milk, rye bread, and strong pork; believe L.I. sound and the south bay to be the ne
                plus ultra of creation; and the "gals" wear white frocks with red or yellow
                waist-ribauds.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Think, my friend, think on all this; and pray nightly for my deliverance from this
                dungeon—where grace or good-breeding never were seen, and from whence
                happiness fled shrieking twenty years ago.—Farewell—and may the
                blessings of hope and peace, the sunshine of a joyous heart, never be absent from
                you.—May the bloom of health glow on your features, the tide of joy swell in
                your heart, and care and grief be strangers to your dwelling</p>
