            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I received with thanks, &amp; read with much interest, the article by Mr. Hinton<a href="#n0305" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0305">1</a>
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  you sent me. Besides Mr. Hinton's own share in the article, I was
                particularly glad to see in full Emerson's<a href="#n0218" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0218">2</a> letter written on
                the first appearance of Leaves of Grass.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> Of this I had
                hitherto only seen an expression or two extracted.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you allow me to respond by sending two English notices of the selection. The one
                in the Academia I find is written by a Mr. Robertson<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">4</a> whom I
                have met occasionally—a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies. The

                himself sent me: I infer that they are in conformity with the original 
                   M.S., but cut out by a less ardent Editor. The Sunday Times is edited by a Mr. Knight<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a>
                of whom also I have some slight personal knowledge. I think the review<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> in that paper
                is very likely done by Mr. Knight himself. The Academia is a recently-started paper,
                chiefly scholastic, and I suppose of restricted circulation. The Sunday Times has no
                doubt a very large circulation, &amp; a good standing among weekly
                newspapers—not being however a specially <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">literary</span>
                organ.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You will, I think, have seen through Mr. Conway<a href="#n0170" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0170">7</a> the notice, also
                eulogistic, in the London Review<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">8</a> I am told of a hostile one in
                the Express (evening edition of the Daily News) but have not seen it: the Morning
                    Star<a href="#n0421b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0421b">9</a> (the paper most closely connected with John Bright) had a very handsome notice about a week ago—but, like
                all literary reviews in that paper, a brief one. These are all the notices I know of
                at present. Perhaps I ought to apologize for saying so much to you about a matter <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I know plays but the smallest part in your thoughts &amp; interests as a
                poet.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As to the sale of the book I really know nothing as yet—not having once seen
                the publisher since the volume was issued.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A glance at the Sunday Times notice recalls to my attention a sentence therein <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  perhaps refer to—about your having given express sanction &amp;c.
                Where the writer gets this from I know not—certainly not from me: indeed the
                P.J. to the selection asserts the exact contrary, and I have not so much as seen Mr.
                Knight for (I dare say) a couple of years.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    was born in London and came to the United States in 1851. He trained as a printer, and,
                    like James Redpath (with whom Whitman corresponded on <a href="loc.00778">August 6, 1863</a>), went to Kansas and joined John
                    Brown's militant group of abolitionists. In fact, but for an accident he would
                    have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was hanged.
                    With Redpath, Hinton was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hand-book to Kansas
                        Territory and the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</span> (1859). Later he wrote
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rebel Invasion of Missouri and Kansas</span> (1865) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Brown and His Men</span> (1894). Apparently Hinton had
                    suggested that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>; see the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Voice</span>, 16 (4 February 1899),
                    2. Hinton served in the Union Army from 1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while
                    lying wounded in a hospital, a scene which he described in the Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span> on August 26, 1871. After the war Hinton wrote
                    for many newspapers. He defended William D. O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Good Gray Poet</span> in the Milwaukee <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel</span> on
                    February 9, 1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening
                        Express</span> on March 7, 1868, was a lengthy account of Whitman's "Fame
                    and Fortunes in England and America," with quotations from O'Connor and
                    the naturalist John Burroughs. Obviously pleased, Whitman sent it to friends, including Rossetti,
                    who acknowledged it on <a href="loc.01879">April 12, 1868</a>. See Horace

                    American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
                    1836 essay <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nature</span>. On <a href="dar.00004">November
                        30, 1868</a>, Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00014">Proud Music of the Storm</a>" was "put in type for my own convenience,
                    and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
                    T. Fields, editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, who promptly
                    accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome
