                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I received with thanks, &amp; read with much interest, the article by Mr. Hinton
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  you sent me. Besides Mr. Hinton's own share in the article, I was
                particularly glad to see in full Emerson's letter written on
                the first appearance of Leaves of Grass. Of this I had
                hitherto only seen an expression or two extracted.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you allow me to respond by sending two English notices of the selection. The one
                in the Academia I find is written by a Mr. Robertson whom I
                have met occasionally—a Scotchman of acute intellectual sympathies. The
                alterations noted in ink in his article are reproduced by me from the copy <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  he

                himself sent me: I infer that they are in conformity with the original 
                   M.S., but cut out by a less ardent Editor. The Sunday Times is edited by a Mr. Knight
                of whom also I have some slight personal knowledge. I think the review in that paper
                is very likely done by Mr. Knight himself. The Academia is a recently-started paper,
                chiefly scholastic, and I suppose of restricted circulation. The Sunday Times has no
                doubt a very large circulation, &amp; a good standing among weekly
                newspapers—not being however a specially <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">literary</span>
                organ.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You will, I think, have seen through Mr. Conway the notice, also
                eulogistic, in the London Review I am told of a hostile one in
                the Express (evening edition of the Daily News) but have not seen it: the Morning
                    Star (the paper most closely connected with John Bright) had a very handsome notice about a week ago—but, like
                all literary reviews in that paper, a brief one. These are all the notices I know of
                at present. Perhaps I ought to apologize for saying so much to you about a matter <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I know plays but the smallest part in your thoughts &amp; interests as a
                poet.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As to the sale of the book I really know nothing as yet—not having once seen
                the publisher since the volume was issued.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A glance at the Sunday Times notice recalls to my attention a sentence therein <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh.d</span>​  perhaps refer to—about your having given express sanction &amp;c.
                Where the writer gets this from I know not—certainly not from me: indeed the
                P.J. to the selection asserts the exact contrary, and I have not so much as seen Mr.
                Knight for (I dare say) a couple of years.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">With warmest regard and friendship,</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">W. M. Rossetti</span>
