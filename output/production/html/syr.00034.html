                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Sir,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 27 January,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> and Leaves of Grass, received.
                Please accept my sincere thanks for your kindness in sending me the book and for the
                gratification you have given me by writing in it as I requested. I beg to enclose
                P.O. order in your favor for One Pound—No. 2044.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I hope that you did not consider my request for your photograph impertinent. My only
                intimation that you had had one recently taken was the published letter to you from
                    Tennyson<a href="#n0625" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0625">2</a> and therefore my allusion to it. It was a very
                deep disappointment to me that I failed so signally in my endeavor to prove to you
                how many in Ireland would gladly avail themselves of an opportunity to show their
                gratitude for such a gift as Leaves of Grass. But the reason is readily given. The
                chief men in connection with the University had contributed through Mr. H.H.
                Gilchrist,<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">3</a> and such men as the Lord Chancellor<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> and Sir E.C. Guinness<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> resemble 
                Gallio<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> 
                in that they care for none of these things. Professor Edward
                    Dowden<a href="#n0199" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0199">7</a> I have the honor of knowing for the past eighteen
                months—indeed, it is to my love of Leaves of Grass that I am indebted for my
                acquaintance with so lovable a man—and he is aware that I did my
                best—however—perhaps I soared too high—in addressing Barbarians. I
                had told Dowden of my not having received any reply to my cards or letters and my
                apprehension that you might be ill, and I have therefore all the greater pleasure in
                conveying (to him at least) your "best regards."</p>

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n0262">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0262 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0262"><span>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
