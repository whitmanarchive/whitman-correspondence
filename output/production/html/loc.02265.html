Hopkins (1844–1904) was born in Wisconsin and became a partner in a dry goods business. He was a soldier in the American Civil War, and he 
                was wounded in both shoulders, injuries from which he never fully recovered. In the 1880s he caught
                typhoid fever and began suffering from mental illness. Hopkins went to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in December 1890 and claimed to be a messiah
                to the Native Americans. At this time, the U.S. government was concerned about the increasing influence of the Ghost Dance spiritual movement at Pine Ridge. Under 
                the mistaken impression that the Sioux chief Sitting Bull was a Ghost Dancer, reservation police on December 15 attempted to 
                arrest him and killed him in the process. Hopkins persisted in his attempts to minister to Native Americans; he went to Washington in 1893, requesting authority to visit the Sioux reservations and preach to them the motto
                and teaching of the pansy, "Union, Culture, and Peace" (James Mooney, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The ghost-dance religion and the Sioux outbreak of 1890</span> [Washington: Government Printing Office, 1896], 893). 
                Hopkins later served a term in the penitentiary for circulating theories of love, sex, and marriage through the mail that
                were deemed to be obsence during legal proceedings; in 1899 the court judged him to be insane and he was transferred to a soldier's home ("Hokpkins Adjudged
                Insane," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dakota Farmers Leader</span> [August 18, 1899], 8). In the early 1900s, he moved
                to South Dakota, where he spent the final years of his life. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02265_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02265_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:

                    Exposition was initiated by an Act of Congress in 1890, when Chicago was chosen
                    as the site for the event celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of
                    Christopher Columbus's "discovery" of America. Planners requested a
                    commemorative poem from Alfred Lord Tennyson, who declined; the request angered
                    many in the U.S., who felt that Whitman should be asked instead. Despite a
                    number of attempts to get Whitman to write a poem for the event, Whitman
                    declined, and he died seven months before the exposition finally opened (a year
                    late) in May of 1893. It is possible that the poem Whitman was working on during
                    the last months of his life–published posthumously as "A Thought of
                    Columbus"–was an effort to write a commemorative poem. See Andrew Vogel,
