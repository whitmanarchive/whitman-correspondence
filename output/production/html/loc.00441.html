            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter last Friday—I should have sent the bundle before but Mother told me that you said you was coming home and we have been expecting to see you all the last week  Mother left last Monday—we had a letter from her the next Wednesday—she arrived all right—found Han better than she expected she says  I have been suffering since Friday with a "run-around" on my middle finger  I have been unable to do anything for the last three days—and seems to me I never suffered so much pain before in so short a time—I send the bundle this morning by Wescotts express—you must forgive me for not attending to it before—I should have done so had not Mother told me you was coming home  And Walt why dont you come home  we would be glad to see you and I think you would enjoy a visit home just now—come and make us a visit—George has started in his building business—he is in hopes of getting a pretty large job in New York—will know to-day—Mr Lane offered him a first rate berth—he thought at first he would take it but afterwards declined—perhaps he did better in going on with his venture—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Everything is going the same all rosey—we hope you will come on and see us—I am in a great hurry this morning—or would write longer</p>
