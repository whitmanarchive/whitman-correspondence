        <span class="tei_salute">Frank and May Baker,</span>
<span class="tei_salute">Dear friends,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your kind letters reached me this morning—it does me good to get such kind reminders—&amp; to know I am still
        so remembered &amp; affectionately invited &amp; asked for. I shall pay you the visit.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Last three weeks I have been extra sick—was taken with bad vertigo spells, vomiting, &amp; fits of prostration—lasted for
        several days, bad at intervals, and, though the worst seems to have past, am left weak &amp; sort of qualmish, with headache.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">It is now as I write about 1 P.M. &amp; very fine—I have been out on the side walk in the sun, but had to get back soon—doctor comes every day—thinks it mainly a serious affection of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">liver</span>, (&amp; stomach too), very
        obstinate—thinks it (this trouble) does not proceed from brain, heart, lungs, kidneys—(those, according to him, 
        are all right)—thinks it indeed not improbable that my tedious paralysis, &amp; all the cerebral business, &amp;c. have
        had their bases (reflexes, &amp;c from emotional bases) in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">said liver</span> trouble—I am much inclined
        to think he has hit it—Am taking medicine—bromides of potash &amp; ammonium—have been taking moderate calomel powders—sit up now all day—but havn't been out, (except to the front door, or stoop, like,) for nearly three weeks—Keep 
        good heart, &amp; expect to yet get, not vigorously well, but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">comparatively well</span>—Want to come on &amp;
        see you, &amp; see the baby, &amp; expect to do so—will send you word—(must first visit Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash, however, at Navy Yard,
        as I said<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>)—Frank, what did you see of the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Academy</span> criticism?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I only saw an extract in the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Courier</span>, half a column—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Love to you, dear friends—not forgetting the dear baby—</span>
