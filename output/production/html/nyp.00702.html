                hitherto—(of course palpably physically <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">declining</span>)—Rec'd a letter, (I suppose you got one too) with the
                announcement of marriage between Chas: W Eldridge and Emily
                Louisa Brown at San Francisco, Dec: 5—(nothing but the
                printed announcement)—Also to-day a letter f'm John Burroughs f'm Poughkeepsie, where they are all, (wife boy &amp; he)
                wintering, housekeeping—J B not either exactly well or ill, but has met a bad
                financial set-back &amp; loss—$1000 or more—the little boy well &amp;
                    growing.

                Dr Bucke is well
                &amp; busy—writes me every two or three days—Horace Traubel was here last evn'g as usual (always welcome)—he is
                well—is a clerk in a bank in Phila—Am sitting at present alone in my
                den—shall have a good stout currying &amp; pummeling (massage) in a few
                minutes—a dark rainy day out, with indications of fog—&amp; what's the
                news with you? &amp; how are matters shaping? I enclose one of my late
                circulars as it may have a wisp of interest to you. The translation of (partial) L
                of G. is well rec'd in Germany. So Browning is dead &amp; Whittier is 82—</p>
