      <p class="tei_p">Yours of 26th rec'd. It looks like something beginning to be done. About Piper's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> bill you can wait till you go personally to Boston.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have written to O'Kane<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> to–day, &amp; I hope you will
        have no further difficulty in getting the books—I have requested him to send word to
        you to come &amp; get them. If we get started in the way we talked of, (&amp; I have no
        doubt we shall,) &amp; satisfaction is felt on both sides, it is certainly my intention that
        you shall have actual &amp; complete control of the sales—&amp; all supplies.</p>

                    Whitman was having difficulties—real or imaginary, as his mother might
                    have said—with booksellers. When Whitman wrote this letter, he had decided
                    to let Butts, as he said, "have actual &amp; complete control of the sales."
                    Commenting on one of the letters of Butts, Whitman observed to Horace Traubel in
                    1889: "What a sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over getting my damned
                    books published! When I look back at it I wonder I didn't somewhere or other on
                    the road chuck the whole business into oblivion" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
