        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Yours of 26th rec'd. It looks like something beginning to be done. About Piper's bill you can wait till you go personally to Boston.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have written to O'Kane to–day, &amp; I hope you will
        have no further difficulty in getting the books—I have requested him to send word to
        you to come &amp; get them. If we get started in the way we talked of, (&amp; I have no
        doubt we shall,) &amp; satisfaction is felt on both sides, it is certainly my intention that
        you shall have actual &amp; complete control of the sales—&amp; all supplies.</p>
