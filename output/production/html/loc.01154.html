I am just back from Roxbury where I went a week ago to make sugar in the old
                woods of my boyhood; had a pretty good time, though too much storm. Only my brother

                old farm. I have to go back there at least twice a year to ease my pain. Oh, the
                pathos of the old place where my youth was passed, where father &amp; mother lived
                &amp; died, &amp; where my heart has always been! </p> 
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been pretty well since I saw you, except that I have been off my sleep a good
                deal. Just now I am having a streak of sleeplessness. I do not quite know what to

I hope spring finds you
                better. I lately heard from you through J. W. Alexander, the artist. I think he will
                make a good picture of you. He is a fine fellow. I am
                glad to hear of the projected new book. I hope it is to be a reality. The title is
                good. My book "Signs &amp; Seasons" will be out this month. I do not think much of
                it,—the poorest of my books, I think. No news with me.

                Kentucky. I hope you will not try to face the summer again in Camden. It is very
                imprudent. A bright afternoon here, with remains of last nights snow still
                lingering. </p>
