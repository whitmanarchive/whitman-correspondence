                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I got continued proofs of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Good Grey Poet​ ">G.G.P</span>​ </span> this morning, and your letter of the 14th this afternoon.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I find from this batch of proofs the necessity for a revise, which I hope you will
                have sent me, for I want the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Good Grey Poet​ ">G.G.P</span>​ </span> to appear as it was in the pamphlet, a form which 
                always pleased us both, and you will see by my corrections, what a mess the poor printer has made of it. It is evidently not his fault, but Bucke's, and I really felt vexed at <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span>. I furnished him with a carefully transcribed <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">printer's</span> copy of the pamphlet, and it is evident that the galoot has had my copy <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">copied</span>—his copy is of course omitting all the typographical directions and making paragraphs <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ad libitum</span>. Hence, the mess! Why in thunder didn't Bucke send the copy I made for him!</p> 

     <p class="tei_p">However, spilt milk, &amp;c. Send me revises of both documents. It will hardly delay matters, and there will be the consolation of
                
                accuracy.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Good Gray</span> reads really well in the new version. I had no
                idea it was so good!!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am glad you liked the Introductory. It is likely to make some very pretty fighting,
                before all is done.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">After I sent it back to you, I remembered one typographical error I meant to correct,
                but 
                forgot it after all. It is on the first slip
                where I speak of Paul Louis Courier's "arrows of
                lightning." This should be "arrows of lightnings"—double plural. If I get a
                revise, I will correct: if not, you please have an "s" put on to my
                "lightning"—it is more effective, though a small matter.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dr. Channing and all send love to you. Jeannie is very weak, though her mind is
                bright and clear. If she weathers through this harsh spring, I shall have hopes of
                her. She has immense vitality, but injures  her chances by ascetic
                notions—total abstinence, etc.—and general desperate Hahnemanianism. It is bad when you don't
                do, in a general way what other people do, and go back upon a fair allowance of
                victuals and drink.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I got the "Man" this afternoon with  Parton's version of Hugo's
                magnificent oration on Voltaire, also the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Trubner​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Trübner​
        
      </span></span> catalogue, which I have not yet had time to look into.
                Thanks.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">P.S. If the printer is puzzled show him a page of the pamphlet, which will show
                    him how I want it set, with the short dashes following the periods, etc.</p>
