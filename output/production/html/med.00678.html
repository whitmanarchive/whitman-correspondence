                    that Richard Watson Gilder wanted to organize a "benefit" in New York at which
                    the poet was to lecture on Lincoln (see also the letter from Whitman to
                    Burroughs of <a href="med.00670">March 11, 1878</a>). Burroughs suggested
                    that Stedman and Swinton should be invited to support the project. Whitman wrote
                    on the envelope of Burroughs's letter: "(first suggestion of lecture)." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
