            <p class="tei_p">I am agreeable to the Lecture project—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">if it could be well put through</span>—About the middle of April (the anniversary of the eve or night of Lincoln's murder) might be a good night—Every thing would depend on how it was fixed up &amp; prepared for &amp; put through—Let me hear more particulars—I could be ready to splurge April 14th or 15th—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am well, considering—in good flesh, appetite &amp; trim generally—Only return'd last night from a long jaunt &amp; absence down at my secluded creek—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Write me immediately, &amp; I will you—</p>
