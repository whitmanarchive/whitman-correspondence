            <p class="tei_p">Since Monday afternoon last (Aug 17th) we have been all agog with heart gladdening excitement; 
                for on that day J.W. Wallace announced his decision to go to America 
                with Dr. B. if possible &amp; asked me to
                enquire about a berth on the "Majestic" &amp; failing that on the "British Prince."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Unfortunately owing to our late application both ships were full but through the good offices of Capt. Nowell

                of the "Br. Prince" we have now secured a berth for him on her. According to present
                arrangements, then Wallace will sail on Aug 26th &amp; if all goes well you may expect 
                to see him about Sept 7th. The doctor will sail on the same day for New York where he will 
                be due about Sept 3rd &amp; we hope that he will be able to stay with you until J.W.W. arrives at Camden</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all very sorry that they cannot go in the same ship: but as things are it cannot be

                to mind it much tho' the Dr. &amp; Wallace will. A pc received from 
                Dr says:—"I am disgusted to think that we may be separated on passage."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am too full of conflicting emotions to write much at present, &amp; I cannot tell you how much I feel this
