                    February 26, 1865. The executors did not date the letter, and Edwin Haviland
                    Miller did not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 1:376). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman knew that her son George
                    Washington Whitman had been released from his imprisonment, so this letter must
                    date to a Sunday, the date in Louisa's hand, in late February 1865. The first
                    line of the letter refers to one that she received as "that from George," but
                    she did not forward it to Walt Whitman at this time. She received George
                    Washington Whitman's <a href="duk.00365">February 24, 1865</a> letter,
                    which she forwarded the following Sunday (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00573">March 4, 1865</a> letter to Walt). Therefore, this letter must date to
                    February 26, the only Sunday between George's February 24 letter to Louisa and
                    Louisa's March 4 letter to Walt. George was expected to arrive in Brooklyn on
                    March 5. This letter's late-February date is corroborated further by her
                    reference to a February 26, 1865 article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York

                        exchanged prisoners. Louisa the following week wrote to Walt that "i should
                        have sent you this letter from George but thought of course you knew all
                        about his arrival at Anapolis" (see her <a href="duk.00573">March 4,
                            1865</a> letter to Walt). Walt remained unaware that his brother
                        George had been exchanged (see his <a href="loc.00840">February 27,
                            1865</a> letter to William Cook).</p>

                        Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                        George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                        the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
                        Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                        Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
                        and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
                        later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
                        inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,

                    (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
                    for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
                    December 1864. Louisa's remark is her first extant reference to Jesse after he
                    was institutionalized the previous December. Shortly after an outburst that
                    followed his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he
                    threatened Martha Mitchell and Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter
                    Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in some hospital or place where he would
                    be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt
                    Whitman). Louisa resisted institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her
                        <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find
                    it in my heart to put him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to
                    Kings County Lunatic Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his
                    death on March 21, 1870 (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22,
                        1870</a> letter to Walt). For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert
