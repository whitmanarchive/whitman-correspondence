                it good to get that from
                george
                and so lately i
                began
                to feel worried at not hearing
                from him in so long i read
                the names in the times
                to day
                but georges was not amongst
                them they were all officers
                Captain Cook
                was very
                good to send me such A
                kind note you know i
                suppose whoo he is brother
                to the one you went to see
                Cook and voluntary he must
                have been exchanged
                it came from Anappolis
                without any stamp wrote
                on it soldiers letter O i
                was very glad indeed to hear from him i just got
                it A few minuts before

                i feel better of it to day

                not i offered her 1 dol an half
                for one day but she did not
