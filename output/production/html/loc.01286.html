            <p class="tei_p">I have now just ready an article intended as the third &amp; concluding one to the
                two already published by you, on "Democracy" and "Personalism." </p>

            <p class="tei_p">This is upon the general subject of a needed American <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Literature,
                    in the highest sense</span>, &amp; of our imaginative, mental, &amp;c. growths,
                home-born, appropriate to &amp; towering high enough for, The States, &amp;
                faithfully in the interests of their Democratic institutions. I have, of course,
                treated the subject in my own way—certain parts strong &amp; earnest—but
                there is nothing in it to make the piece at all improper for the
                magazine—probably indeed may be found more appropriate &amp;
                serviceable—more to rouse editorial &amp; critical remark, &amp;c—than
                the already published articles. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I propose to you to print it in the Galaxy for July. It will make from eleven to
                twelve pages in your new form &amp; type. The name is <span class="inline_quote">

                    </span>
                </span> The price, if satisfactory, will be the same as for each of the previous
                articles, viz: $100.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I reserve the right of printing it in future book. I can send it on
                immediately.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think it will be best not to delay too long, as the interest in the thing is now
                up, something like a serial story. This is the conclusion, &amp; I should like to
                have it in July number. </p>

                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
                    York newspapers until he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army and Navy
                        Journal</span> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
                    he established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866. Financial control of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William
                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
