                    (1829–1901) was the son of John Prentiss (1818–1861) and his first
                    wife, Amelia F. Kennedy, of Baltimore, Maryland (d. 1857). Thomas became a
                    presbyterian minister in Cornwall-on-the-Hudson, New York. He was the older
                    brother of Clifton Kennedy Prentiss (1835–1865) and William Scollay
                    Prentiss (1839–1865), who fought on opposite sides during the American
                    Civil War. Both of Thomas's brothers were wounded in the conflict and both died
                    as a result of their injuries. Whitman met and cared for Clifton and William at
                    Armory Square Hospital, where the poet was volunteering. Whitman described his
