                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">In response to your letter of the 5th instant, which has just reached me, I have to
                say that I accept the proposal made in it respecting your English publication of my
                poems—&amp; hereby agree that you have the privilege of selling that
                publication in the United States, on payment to me, or my agent, of a royalty of one
                shilling, (or 25 cents gold,) upon every copy sold in the U. S.
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Of course it is distinctly understood that this grant from me does not affect my
                copyright here, but that said copyright, in each of its particulars &amp; in the
                whole, is absolutely fully &amp; exclusively retained by me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is not improbable that a very handsome &amp; steady sale of the English volume
                may be effected here, by the right business manipulation, a moderate, judicious
                advertising &amp;c. My book has never been really published here at all
                &amp; the market is in a sort vacant of supplies. I will probably suggest to you
                something more on these points, in a future letter.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I received yesterday a letter from Mr. Conway, conveying your proposition, to which I
                mailed an immediate answer, to the same effect as herewith. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Accept my thanks for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake</span>. It has not yet come from the post office, but I know
                it will prove to me a profoundly interesting study, and a handsome gift. It is, in
                fact, a book I was wanting.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">After the reception of the copy you speak of—my own volume—(now
                probably on its way)—I shall doubtless have occasion to express genuine
                pleasure—with gratitude both to its editor &amp; publisher.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">And now, my dear sir, please accept with my trust in the success of the enterprise my
                kindest respects to yourself personally. </p>
