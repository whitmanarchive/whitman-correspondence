                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span><a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">In response to your letter of the 5th instant, which has just reached me, I have to
                say that I accept the proposal made in it respecting your English publication of my
                poems—&amp; hereby agree that you have the privilege of selling that
                publication in the United States, on payment to me, or my agent, of a royalty of one
                shilling, (or 25 cents gold,) upon every copy sold in the U. S.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Of course it is distinctly understood that this grant from me does not affect my
                copyright here, but that said copyright, in each of its particulars &amp; in the
                whole, is absolutely fully &amp; exclusively retained by me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is not improbable that a very handsome &amp; steady sale of the English volume
                may be effected here, by the right business manipulation, a moderate, judicious
                advertising &amp;c. My book has never been really published here at all
                &amp; the market is in a sort vacant of supplies. I will probably suggest to you
                something more on these points, in a future letter.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I received yesterday a letter from Mr. Conway, conveying your proposition, to which I
                mailed an immediate answer, to the same effect as herewith. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Accept my thanks for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake</span>.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> It has not yet come from the post office, but I know
                it will prove to me a profoundly interesting study, and a handsome gift. It is, in
                fact, a book I was wanting.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">After the reception of the copy you speak of—my own volume—(now
                probably on its way)—I shall doubtless have occasion to express genuine
                pleasure—with gratitude both to its editor &amp; publisher.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">And now, my dear sir, please accept with my trust in the success of the enterprise my
                kindest respects to yourself personally. </p>

                    when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a furor. Perhaps because
                    he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten introduced to an
                    English audience such writers as Robert Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell
                    Holmes, and Bret Harte. After his death, his business was purchased by Chatto
                    and Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested
                    Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that
                    prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01573_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01573_n4"><span><a href="loc.01731">Hotten's letter</a> repeated the financial proposals related by Moncure

                        Essay</span> (1868), 300–303, pointed out similarities between Walt
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." Included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs before Sunrise</span> (1871) was his famous lyric "To Walt
                    Whitman in America." For the story of Swinburne's veneration of Walt Whitman and
