                our meeting on Monday last—wh. was held here—we spent the time
                in reading over our Whitman Correspondence—including H.L.T's

                                American poet, celebrated his seventy-second birthday on May 31 in a quiet but happy way. The weather was delightful,
                                and Mr Whitman sat in a little summer-house receiving callers nearly all day. The arbour was filled with flowers before dusk.
                                The "good grey poet," though not able to get about very briskly, is in good health and spirits. The old gentleman entertained his guests
                                with selections from his own works. From time to time, as groups gathered, he would open a volume, and eyeing his audience critically,
                                select a passage which he believed would please them. Letters of congratulation were received from Lord Tennyson 
                                and many others.
