        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have had a succession of bad spells, (&amp; pretty close together) since I wrote
        the encouraging lines, some two or three weeks ago—indeed for a month now, in addition to other troubles, a pronounced
        pain &amp; distress in left side, growing intenser &amp; quite extended—often
        coming on at night, waking me up, &amp; keeping me from sleep all night
        afterward—But this morning as I write, (9 o'clock after breakfast—fish,
        Graham bread, tea, my appetite, though modified, by no means lost)—I feel
        quite <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">peert</span>, in good spirits, free from any marked
        distress—&amp; if you were to come in this minute, (than which, dear Nelly, I
        can think of no blesseder God-send,) you would say I appear in face, flesh, color,
        expression, &amp;c. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">just the same Walt as of yore</span>—Will
        this good turn &amp; let-up of today (yesterday morning at this time I felt like
        death—&amp; thought of it—) be followed by other relapses?
        Probably—for so it has been now for nearly a year. And yet each time I cannot
        help fancying that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">now</span> I am going to recuperate—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I write, sitting here in the parlor alone by the window, it is very
        pleasant—soothing—it is a sweet balmy, not hot morning—my
        sister's sister, from Norwich, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Connecticut​ ">Conn.</span>​  is here on a
        visit, with her little 8 months old babe-boy—She is walking in the other
        room, singing it to sleep, in her arms—she has a fine contralto voice, &amp;
        is singing beautifully, unconsciously—it does me good too—</p>
