            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Cummins has called upon me, bringing me your note of
                    17th &amp; we have had quite a talk—he seems
                to be a wide-awake, candid young man, &amp; makes a good impression upon me. He
                spoke of you, of his own affairs &amp; fortunes, of Idaho, of Judge Kelly, Holbrook, &amp;c. &amp;c.—In

                to Judge Kelly, &amp; his matter, I had already formed my opinion &amp; made out my
                Report several days ago—The Attorney General is full of anxiety &amp; debate,
                on the big things that are up, just now,—&amp; has not been able to hear the
                Report, &amp; decide upon it—but he told me this morning he would try to do so
                very shortly—If he decides as I have advised him, you &amp; Cummins will have
                no reason to be dissatisfied.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Dear friend, I rec'd your note when you left here—it was sent
                on to me at Brooklyn.—I value George Alfred Townsend's
                appreciation of L. of G. It was magnificent. Where is Townsend now?—I hope it may happen one
                day that I may have him near at hand, that we get to be friends—such is in my
                mind.—There is nothing new in my affrairs—all goes on as <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01831.004_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01831.004_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01831.004_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> usual in
