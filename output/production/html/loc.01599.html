        <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter of Tuesday last, &amp; was glad to hear every thing was going on all right. I am well, 
        &amp; still enjoying myself in a quiet way—I have been home every evening since I come—but out quite a good 
        deal in the day—the weather is splendid here—plenty cool enough. This has got to be a great place for boating—All the rich men have their yachts, and most every young man belongs to a boat or yacht club—sometimes of a pleasant day, especially Sunday, you will see them out all over up &amp; down the bay in swarms—the yachts look beautiful enough, with white sails &amp; many with white hulls &amp; their long pennants flying—it is a new thing to see them so plenty.
      </p>

      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Pete, I am sitting in my room home, finishing this—have just had a bath, &amp; dressed myself to go over to New York, 
        partly on business—shall go down &amp; put this in the P. O. here—shall walk down as it is a very pleasant forenoon—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">When you write tell me if you have read Charles Reade's novel of "Foul Play"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—if not, I have one here I will send you—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I believe that is all this time—I send my love, dear son, &amp; a good loving kiss—I think of you every day—Give my best regards to all enquiring friends, &amp; inform them I expect to be back in about three weeks—</p>
      
      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Good bye, my darling boy—from your comrade &amp; father,</span>

                    on June 30, 1872; Whitman described the 1872 trip in his <a href="prc.00026">July 19, 1872</a> letter to Charles Eldridge. Note also the similar
