        the Paine bust affair is to come off. I see an announcement 
        in the paper that I am to read a poem on the occasion. I do not propose to read a poem—but I will promise 
        to be there, &amp; speak just a little (say 10 minutes)—if I can be put on the early part of the program 
        (as waiting fags me out entirely)—&amp; perhaps it would be necessary that I should be sent for in a carriage. 
        I would advise that you have some good music, &amp; no long-winded address at all. (Couldn't you get some 
        good baritone singer to sing Paine's fine lively old song of "the Liberty Tree"?)
