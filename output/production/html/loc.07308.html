                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
                    outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
                    capital investors."

                    addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,

                    poet had the special pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th birthday
                    (May 31, 1889) through special arrangement with Frederick Oldach. See Whitman's
                        <a href="loc.03392">May 16, 1889</a>, letter to Oldach. Only 300
                    copies were printed, and Whitman signed the title page of each one. The volume
                    also included the annex <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sands at Seventy</span> and his essay

                    to decipher her father's handwritten record of the physician's name. Dr. Charles
                    A. Sippi's diary provides no clue as to the identity of Dr. A____t. However, a
                    Dr. Henry Arnott is listed at 226 Queens Avenue, London, Ontario in 1890. There
                    is no earlier listing (letter of March 13, 1974 from Edward Phelps of the Weldon
                    Library). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
