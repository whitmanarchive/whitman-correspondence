            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Nelly has received a letter from me posting you up of my doings, &amp;c. Any letters that come to me, up to Saturday next, please send on here. After that, do not send any, as I shall return Monday or Tuesday next. The weather here the last three days is very unpleasant, sloppy &amp; thick. I was at the opera last night, Trovatore<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—very, very good singing &amp; acting—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel to devote myself more to the work of my life, which is making poems. I must bring out Drum Taps. I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">must</span> be continually bringing out poems—now is the hey day. I shall range along the high plateau of my life &amp; capacity for a few years now, &amp; then swiftly descend. The life here in the cities, &amp; the objects, &amp;c of most, seem to me very flippant &amp; shallow somehow since I returned this time—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My New York boys are good, too good—if I staid here a month longer I should be killed with kindness—The great recompense of my journey here is to see my mother so well, &amp; so bravely sailing on amid many troubles &amp; discouragements like a noble old ship—My brother Andrew is bound for another world—he is here the greater part of the time—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Charley, I think sometimes to be a woman is greater than to be a man—is more eligible to greatness, not the ostensible article, but the real one. Dear comrade, I send you my love, &amp; to William &amp; Nelly, &amp; remember me to Major [Hapgood]<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—</p>

                    one half of the Boston based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,

                    December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
                    Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
                    become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
                    desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
