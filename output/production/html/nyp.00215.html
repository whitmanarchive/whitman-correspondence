               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Nelly has received a letter from me posting you up of my doings, &amp;c. Any letters that come to me, up to Saturday next, please send on here. After that, do not send any, as I shall return Monday or Tuesday next. The weather here the last three days is very unpleasant, sloppy &amp; thick. I was at the opera last night, Trovatore—very, very good singing &amp; acting—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel to devote myself more to the work of my life, which is making poems. I must bring out Drum Taps. I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">must</span> be continually bringing out poems—now is the hey day. I shall range along the high plateau of my life &amp; capacity for a few years now, &amp; then swiftly descend. The life here in the cities, &amp; the objects, &amp;c of most, seem to me very flippant &amp; shallow somehow since I returned this time—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My New York boys are good, too good—if I staid here a month longer I should be killed with kindness—The great recompense of my journey here is to see my mother so well, &amp; so bravely sailing on amid many troubles &amp; discouragements like a noble old ship—My brother Andrew is bound for another world—he is here the greater part of the time—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Charley, I think sometimes to be a woman is greater than to be a man—is more eligible to greatness, not the ostensible article, but the real one. Dear comrade, I send you my love, &amp; to William &amp; Nelly, &amp; remember me to Major [Hapgood]—</p>
