                        1890–1892</span>. That version was based on a transcript that appeared
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span> on February 8, 1890, and that
                    Whitman used in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-bye My Fancy</span> (1890). The current
                    transcription, which appeared <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence, Volume 6: A

                    New York Public Library. The transcription of the manuscript letter reinstates
                    Whitman's salute as well as the first line. It also reveals that the line
                    stating "America continues generally busy enough..." was changed to "America

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
