            <p class="tei_p">I am still here, no very mark'd or significant change or happening—fairly
                buoyant spirits &amp;c—but surely slowly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ebbing</span>—at this moment sitting here in my den Mickle Street by the oak
                wood fire, in the big strong old chair with wolf-skin spread over back—bright
                sun, cold, dry winter day—America continues generally busy enough all over her
                vast demesnes (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">intestinal agitation</span> I call it)—talking,
                plodding, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">making money</span>, every one trying to get
                on—perhaps to get toward the top—but no special individual
                signalism—(just as well I guess)—I write without any particular purpose,
                but I tho't I w'd show you I appreciate y'r kindness &amp; remembrance—The two
                slips enclosed you are at liberty to do what you like with—affectionate
                remembrance to the dear sister—</p>
