            <p class="tei_p">I learn to day to my great surprise that the Philistines are down on you again about
                the Children of Adam. What purblind asses! But there's
                no use in irritating oneself with thinking about it—only somehow every new
                instance of human folly and cant strikes one as something unexpected and
                bewildering; as if one hadn't had plenty of occasion to get accustomed to anything
                or everything in that line. I am sure it will do you more good than harm in the end.
                I am, sometime soon, to read something on the Leaves of Grass before a German
                audience, a 'Literary Club,' in Dresden. This will
                perhaps <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01026_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>lead to my
                finding a collaborateur for the translation—said translation owing to press of
                other business has not been very rigorously pursued lately, but after this month I
                shall take off my coat to it again. You
                    received some M.S.? A great event has lately happened in our home. I have
                become the father of a vigorous boy—our first-born; now some ten days old. "Ay, madam—it is common" but nevertheless it seems
                particular to me, naturally; and is altogether an enlivening and wonderful fact to
                us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What fearful doings in Ireland lately! I have a
                recantation to make to you on that subject. I remember once writing to you that Home
                Rule, or Separation, was in my <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01027_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>opinion a chimerical &amp; undesirable scheme for Ireland. Yet then,
                and always, that was the cause that had my affection &amp; interest—only I saw
                such obstacles in the way, &amp; foresaw such dangers to liberty if it were realized,
                that I could not go with it. Now all that has changed itself in my mind. I recognize
                now the deepseated expression of a national will in the movement. I see that the
                English can <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never</span> govern us, &amp; do worst when they mean
                best. And I see that the conflicts and miseries which I still believe to be
                inevitable on the fulfilment of the idea, will only be the (necessary) preludes
                towards a grander liberty and nationality than is at all within our reach now. I
                always abominated the English, and it is <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01028_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01028_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01028_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>a great relief to me to find that I
                can support, with the feeling that I am doing right, the cause that I always
                sympathized with in my heart.—One thing is certain—these wretched
                outrages will cease instantly when Ireland has a government of her own. And that she
                will surely have, and I believe before long. If we only had arms we'd have a try
                when England gets into difficulties about this Egyptian business. (So unspeakably
                shameful to her, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">more</span> so to France). But I expect it will be "constitutional" measures for
                some time yet. Nothing perhaps does us more harm than your dynamite party in
                    America.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are well &amp; strong now, &amp; that you'll be well defended in your own
                country against this last outrage.</p>
