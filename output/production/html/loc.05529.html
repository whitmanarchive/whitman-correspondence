                that I could not go with it. Now all that has changed itself in my mind. I recognize
                now the deepseated expression of a national will in the movement. I see that the

                best. And I see that the conflicts and miseries which I still believe to be
                inevitable on the fulfilment of the idea, will only be the (necessary) preludes
                towards a grander liberty and nationality than is at all within our reach now. I

                outrages will cease instantly when Ireland has a government of her own. And that she
                will surely have, and I believe before long. If we only had arms we'd have a try
                when England gets into difficulties about this Egyptian business. (So unspeakably
                shameful to her, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">more</span> so to France).<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> But I expect it will be "constitutional" measures for

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The

                    (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston has given a humorous account of the Dresden society

                        University Review</span> 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
                    signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
                    criticism. Rolleston also comments on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
                    which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claims that "Walt
                    Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
                    he was treated from a more exclusively philosophical point of view." After the

                    discusses the schism among the various Irish leaders in America after the Irish
                    agitation of 1879–1881. The schism produced three parties—one headed
                    by the editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Irish World</span>; another headed by the
                    President of the Land League organization in America and the editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pilot</span>; and a third represented by the proprietor of the

                    even to name the leaders is to confer a distinction which they do not deserve.
                    They have not politics at heart. They can find no one to trust them. Even the
                    most serious revolutionists avoid them, and so they content themselves by making
                    war upon society in general, and inciting dupes to commit crimes which they
                    would never have thought of themselves!" </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
