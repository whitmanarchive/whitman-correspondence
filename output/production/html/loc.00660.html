                    26–28, 1873. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman provided no date in her hand, and
                    Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter January 20, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:370). Miller's date is consistent with Louisa's and son
                    Edward's residence in Camden, New Jersey, at the home of George Washington
                    Whitman and wife Louisa Orr Haslam "Lou" Whitman, but Miller's date is
                    incorrect. This letter dates to late March 1873, just after Lou returned from an
                    extended trip to Philadelphia. For her daughter-in-law's impending departure,
                    see Louisa's <a href="duk.00622">March 17, 1873</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman. Two matters in this letter support a date of composition during the
                    week of Lou's return. According to this letter, Louisa's daughter-in-law has
                    been "gone since last saturday week." Also, Louisa had received a Tuesday letter
                    from Walt. The date of her most recently received letter can be inferred by
                    eliminating Walt's <a href="yal.00413">March 29–[30], 1873</a>
                    letter, which ended a week-long hiatus in letters from him (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00617">March 29, 1873</a> letter to Walt). The most reasonable
                    surmise, then, is that this letter dates to late in the last full week of March
                    and precedes Louisa's <a href="yal.00413">March 29–30, 1873</a>
                    letter to her son. The Tuesday letter from Walt (not extant) dates to March 23,
                    1873. If Lou's mid-March trip to Philadelphia ended approximately March 25 and a
                    letter from Walt was received on Tuesday (March 25), this letter dates to
                    between March 26 and March 28, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00660_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.00660_n3"><span>Walt Whitman's March 23?,

                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. He married Louisa Orr Haslam in
                    spring 1871, and they moved to 722 Stevens Street in Camden, where he was
                    employed inspecting pipe at foundry sites for Joseph Phineas Davis, Moses Lane,
