            <p class="tei_p">Yours <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  &amp; welcomed—will write at length soon—(meantime this
                card)—Dr B[ucke]'s book has some sale all the time—nothing vehement, but
                the orders drop in lingeringly—yesterday ten
                copies from Trübner London, &amp;c. &amp;c. My opinion that the book is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a success</span> (in the most important requisites) is to-day
                more decided than ever—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">largely thanks to you</span>. Dr B has
                been in N. Y. for a month—has been twice here to see me. Did you see my article in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span>
                of Nov. 24? I have lately sent a little 20 line poem
                to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harpers</span>—accepted immediately &amp; paid for
                    ($50!)—I am well as usual—write
                often—</p>
