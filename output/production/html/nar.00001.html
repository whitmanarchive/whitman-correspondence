                    (1830–1899), born in France and educated at the University of Paris, was a
                    soldier who helped to recruit the Fifty-first New York Volunteer Infantry.
                    LeGendre was severely wounded at New Bern, North Carolina, on March 14, 1862, as
                    George observed in his letter of March 16–18,1862, to his mother, Lousia
                    Van Velsor Whitman (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
                    Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). LeGendre was appointed lieutenant
                    colonel on September 20, 1862, and later succeeded Edward Ferrero (see Walt
                    Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>) and Robert B. Potter (see Walt Whitman's letter to
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>) as
                    commanding officer of the Fifty-first Regiment. During the second Battle of the
                    Wilderness, May 6, 1864, he lost his left eye and the bridge of his nose, and
                    was honorably discharged on October 4 of the same year. See Whitman's account of
                    LeGendre's hospitalization in his letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="loc.00827">May 13, 1864</a>
