            <p class="tei_p">my
            letter is rather late this
            week i waited thinking
            i should have some
            word either from
            matty or hanna but
            i have no word from
            either george had a 
                letter from jeff
            the other
            day he said matty was
            writing to mother but
            i have not received any
            as to han i dont expect
            any i thought when the
            box went maybee she
            would write a few
            lines i requested her
            particularly to write if
            only a few lines and that
            we would expect her
            to come this spring but i
            have not heard nothing
            since heyde wrote they
            got the box) sometimes
            i get so worried about
            her that it makes me quite
            unhappy</p>
