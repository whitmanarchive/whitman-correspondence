                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
                    sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
                    early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
                    the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
                    volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
                    to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13,
                        1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of

                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
