                        to December 18 or 19, 1863. It is possible, though unlikely, that it dates
                        to as late as December 24, 1863.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This brief letter from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt Whitman is inscribed
                        in the margins of George Washington Whitman's <a href="duk.00348">December 9, 1863</a> letter from Camp Pittman, Kentucky. Louisa
                        received the letter from George on the same day that she received Walt's
                            <a href="loc.00805">December 15, 1863</a> letter, and she planned
                        to forward George's letter after Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had read
                        it. Jeff probably read George's letter shortly after his return from the
                        surveying trip that took him to Springfield, Massachusetts. Jeff's return
                        from that surveying trip is estimated at December 18 or 19, 1863 because
                        Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman noted that Jeff had visited the home of his
                        sister-in-law Nancy McClure Whitman (his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's
                        widow) on December 19 or 20, 1863 (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> letter to Walt; and see Mattie's December 21,
                        1863 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie:
                            The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1971], 34–35).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Jeff in his late-December letter to Walt had yet to acquire the brief sketch
                        of Walt from an article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>,
                        which is the subject of Louisa's note on George's letter (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00430">December 28, 1863</a> letter to Walt). The more
                        probable case is that Jeff was so busy that he was unable to write Walt the
                        letter about acquiring a copy of the sketch in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, and Louisa took it upon herself to take care
                        of the matter and forward George's letter after Jeff read it, probably on
                        December 19 or 20, 1863. The less probable case is that Jeff's apology at
                        month's end for not acquiring copies of the sketch could indicate that
                        Louisa had continued to delay forwarding George's letter and had waited
                        perhaps another week, until December 24 or 25, 1863. Based on Louisa's <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter to Walt, which
                        mentions neither George nor the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>
                        sketch, the matter of forwarding George's letter and the sketch to Walt were
                        unlikely to remain matters of pressing concern to her, though Jeff had still
                        to complete the task of acquiring copies.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00572_n2 note" id="duk.00572_n2"><span>The "little peece" was a

                    physician Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867), a close friend of the Whitman
                    family, wrote the sketch of Walt Whitman. However, Jeff had several talks with
                    Ruggles about placing his brother Jesse Whitman in an asylum in December, and he
                    did not mention Ruggles's authorship in his next letter to Walt (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00430">December 28, 1863</a> letter to Walt). Walt suspected
                    that the sketch was written by Joseph Hayward, Jr. (1833–1890), a city

                        (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
