                to you realizing your living presence with all my might.—First, about Percy—things 
                are beginning to look a little brighter for him. He is just entering upon a new engagement with some very large &amp; 
                successful works—the Blenavon Iron Co.—where, though his salary will not be 
                higher at first, his opportunities of improvement will be better &amp; he is also to be allowed to take private 
                practice (in assaying &amp; analyzing). The manager there believes in Science &amp; is friendly to Percy &amp;

                /76 is out they will be able to marry. I see, and indeed I have known ever since he formed this attachment, that I must 
                not look for him to come to America with me. But what I build upon dearest Friend is that when I have been a little while 
                in America &amp; have made friends &amp; had time to look about me I might hear of a good certainty for him—his 
                excellent training at the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="London​ ">Lond.</span>​  <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="School​ ">Sch.</span>​  
                of Mines, large experience at Blenavon energy ability &amp; sturdy uprightness will make him a first rate manager of works

                But the leaving him so happy with his young wife will make it easier for us to part—Nov. 26—Beatrice has 
                begun to work at anatomy at the School of Medicine for Women lately founded, &amp; seems to delight in her work. She 
                will not enter on the full course all at once—I am for taking things gently. Women have plenty of strength but it 
                is of a different kind from <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">mens​ </span><span class="tei_corr">men's​
        
      </span></span> &amp; must work by gentler &amp; slower 
                means—Above all I do not like what pushes violently aside domestic duties &amp; pleasures. The special work must 
                combine itself with these; I am sure it can. Herby is getting on very nicely, never did 
                student love his work better. He is eager, &amp; by making the best use of present opportunities &amp; advantages

                yet looking towards America full of cheerful hopes &amp; sympathy. Grace is less developed 
                in intellect but not less in character than the others. I can't describe her but send you her photograph. There is a 
                freshness &amp; independence of character about her—yet withal a certain waywardness &amp; reserve. She is a good 
                instinctive judge of character—more influenced by it than by books—yet with a growing taste for them too. 
                She comes to America with a gay and buoyant curiosity, declining to make up her mind about anything till she gets there.

                to transplant our home bodily—to bring as much as we can of our own furniture because we have beautiful old things 
                precious in Herby's eyes &amp; that we are all fond of. And coming straight to Philadelphia &amp; taking a house somewhere 
                on the outskirts of it or Camden immediately we fancy this might be practicable, but have not yet launched into the matter—I 
                have just heard from Mr. Rossetti, &amp; also from Mrs. Conway

      </span></span> having seen you, &amp; if
                his report be not too sanguine it is a cheering one &amp; would comfort me much dearest Friend. 
                But what he says is so favourable I am afraid to believe it

                altogether, knowing that you would make the very best of yourself &amp; indeed be probably at your best with the pleasure 
                of seeing an old friend fresh from England &amp; also that he is sanguine.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nov. 30. And now, dear Friend, I have had a very great pleasure indeed, thanks to you—a visit from Mr. 
                Marvin—&amp; hope to have another when he returns from Paris. And the account he gives 
                of you is so cheerful—so vivid—it seems to part assunder a gloomy cloud that was brooding in my mind. 
                And though I know that for the short hours that you feel bright &amp; well are many long hours when you are far 
                otherwise, still I feel sure those short hours are the earnest of perfect recovery—with a fine 
                patience—boundless patience. And now I can picture you sitting in your favourite

                your surroundings. And a great deal else full of interest Mr. Marvin told me. I was loth for him to go, but one
                hour is so small we have noticed for a friend I am sorry to say. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">William Rossetti has a little girl which is a great delight to him. Miss Hillard of Brooklyn 
                has also paid me a visit &amp; spoken to me of you. She charmed me much—only I felt a little cross with her

                we both refused to be discouraged, for after all he can send his pictures to England to be established &amp;c. having 
                plenty of friends who would see to it; &amp; we are both firm in the faith that if you can only paint the really good pictures 
                the rest will take care of itself somehow or other—&amp; that can be done as well in America as in England—but of
