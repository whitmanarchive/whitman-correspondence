                will not enter on the full course all at once—I am for taking things gently. Women have plenty of strength but it

                of you is so cheerful—so vivid—it seems to part assunder a gloomy cloud that was brooding in my mind. 
                And though I know that for the short hours that you feel bright &amp; well are many long hours when you are far 
                otherwise, still I feel sure those short hours are the earnest of perfect recovery—with a fine

                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
