            <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Tennyson,</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">It is a long time since my last to you. I have however mailed you once or twice pieces of mine in print which I
            suppose you rec'd. Jan. '73 I was taken down with illness—some three months,
            afterward was recovering at Washington, when called here by the death of my
            mother—&amp; from that time becoming worse, I have given up work &amp; remained
            here since.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I had paralysis from cerebral anemia. </p>
         <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your last letter, &amp; the good, good photograph—which I have looked at
            many times, &amp; sometimes almost fancied it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> in person
            silently sitting nigh. To-day, a cloudy &amp; drizzly Sunday, I have taken it in my
            head, sitting here alone &amp; write—follow the inner mood—(a tinge of
            Quaker blood &amp; breed in me)—though really without any thing to say, only just
            to write to you.</p> 
         <p class="tei_p">It is pleasant here, right on the banks of the noble Delaware, opposite Philadelphia. The doctors say I shall yet come round, &amp; I think so too. I do not fail in flesh, color, spirits—appetite &amp; sleep pretty
            good—am up &amp; dressed every day, &amp; go out a little—but very lame
            yet.</p>
         <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Truly your friend—</span>
         <span class="tei_signed">WW</span>
