                <span class="tei_salute">MY DEAREST FRIEND:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have just been sauntering in our little but sunny garden which slopes to the
                South—surveying with much satisfaction some fruit trees—plum, green
                gage, pear, cherry, apple—which we have just had planted to train up against
                the house and fence—in which fashion fruit ripens much better with our English
                modicum of sunshine, besides taking no room &amp; casting no shade over your little
                bit of ground—Then we have filed our large window with flowers in pots which
                make the room smell as delicious as a garden. Giddy is assiduous in keeping them
                well watered &amp; tended.—Welcome was your postcard—with the little
                rain-bird's coy note in it. But I had not before heard of your illness, dear
                friend—the letter before, you spoke of being unusually well, as I trust you
                are again now, &amp; enjoying the spring. I am well again so far as digestion
                &amp;c. goes; but bronchitis asthma of a chronic kind still trouble me. My
                breath is so short I cannot walk, which is a privation. I am going, at the beginning
                of June, to stay with Bee in Edinburgh, as she will not have any holiday or be able
                to come &amp; see us this year, &amp; much am I longing to be with her. Have you
                begun to have any summer thoughts, dear Walt? And do they turn towards England,
                &amp; our nest therein? Yes, I have received &amp; have enjoyed all the papers
                &amp; cuttings—dearly like what you said of Carlyle. Everyone here is speaking
                bitterly of the harsh judgments &amp; sarcastic descriptions of people in the
                "reminiscences." But I know that at bottom his heart was genial and good &amp; that
                he wrote those in a miserable mood—&amp; never looked at them again
                afterwards. I hope you received the little memoir of my husband all right.
                Herby is very busy with a drawing of you—hopes that with the many sketches he
                made, &amp; the vivid impress on his memory &amp; the help of photographs, it will
                be good. I wish he had possessed as much power with the brush when he was in America
                as he has now—he is making very great progress in mastery of the technique. I
                observe, too, that he reads &amp; dwells upon your poems—especially the "Walt
                Whitman"—with growing frequency &amp; delight. We often say, "Won't Walt like
                sitting in that sunny window?" or "by that cheery open fire" or
                "sauntering on the heath"—&amp; picture you here in a thousand different ways.
                I believe Maggie Lesley is coming from Paris, where she is studying art in good
                earnest, at the beginning of May, &amp; then will come and spend a few days
                with us. Welcome are American friends! The Buxton Forman's took tea with us last
                week &amp; we had pleasant talk of you &amp; of Dr. Bucke. Mrs. Forman is a sincere,
                sympathetic, motherly woman whom you would like. The Rossetti's too have been to see
                us—we didn't think William in the best health or spirits—&amp; his wife
                was not looking well either, but then another baby is just coming.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">This Easter time the poorest of London working folk flock in enormous numbers to
                Hampstead Heath; it is a sight that would interest you—they are rougher
                &amp; noisier &amp; poorer than such folks in America—&amp; the men more prone
                to get the worse for drink—but there is a good deal of fun &amp;
                merriment too—the girls &amp; boys racing about on donkeys (who have a
                pretty hard time of it)—plenty of merry-go-rounds—&amp;
                enjoyment of the pure air &amp; sunshine, &amp; such sights, more than they know.
                The light is failing, dearest friend; so with love from us all,
                good-bye.</p>
