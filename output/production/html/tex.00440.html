            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 21st rec'd, with the curious list—I suppose of course from the
                District Attorney's office—of "suggestions" lines and pages and pieces &amp;c.
                to be "expunged." The list whole &amp; several is rejected by me, &amp; will not be
                thought of under any circumstances.</p>
            <div class="tei_p p">To give you a definitive idea of what I meant in my notes of March 8 and March
                19—&amp; of course stick to—I mail you with this a copy of L. of G. with
                the not numerous but fully effective changes and cancellations I thought of making:
                see in it pages
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">84</li><li class="tei_item">88</li><li class="tei_item">89</li><li class="tei_item">&amp; 90</li></ul></div>
            <p class="tei_p">All those lines &amp; passages marked in pencil to come out, &amp; their places to be
                exactly filled with other matter—so that they will superficially present the
                same appearance as now. The whole thing would not
                involve an expense of more than from 5 to $10—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My proposition is that we at once make the revision here indicated, &amp; go on with
                the regular issue of the book—If then any further move is made by the District
                Attorney &amp; his backers—as of course there are others behind it
                all—they will only burn their own fingers, &amp; very badly—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I want the paper copy I send of L of G. returned to me when through.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_signed">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>
            
               <p class="tei_p">Let this whole matter be kept quiet in the house—no talk or information
                    that may lead to newspaper items—the change to be just silently
                    made—the book, &amp; at casual view all its pages, to look just the
                    same—only those minutely looking detecting the difference—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Inform the official people at once that the cancellation is to be made for future
                        editions.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Write me at once &amp; definitively if all this suits—</p>
