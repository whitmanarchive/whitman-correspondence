                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sirs</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 21st rec'd, with the curious list—I suppose of course from the
                District Attorney's office—of "suggestions" lines and pages and pieces &amp;c.
                to be "expunged." The list whole &amp; several is rejected by me, &amp; will not be
                thought of under any circumstances.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">To give you a definitive idea of what I meant in my notes of March 8 and March
                19—&amp; of course stick to—I mail you with this a copy of L. of G. with
                the not numerous but fully effective changes and cancellations I thought of making:
                see in it pages
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">84</li><li class="tei_item">88</li><li class="tei_item">89</li><li class="tei_item">&amp; 90</li></ul></p>
            <p class="tei_p">All those lines &amp; passages marked in pencil to come out, &amp; their places to be
                exactly filled with other matter—so that they will superficially present the
                same appearance as now.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> The whole thing would not
                involve an expense of more than from 5 to $10—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My proposition is that we at once make the revision here indicated, &amp; go on with
                the regular issue of the book—If then any further move is made by the District
                Attorney &amp; his backers—as of course there are others behind it
                all—they will only burn their own fingers, &amp; very badly—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I want the paper copy I send of L of G. returned to me when through.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_signed">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>
            
               <p class="tei_p">Let this whole matter be kept quiet in the house—no talk or information
                    that may lead to newspaper items—the change to be just silently
                    made—the book, &amp; at casual view all its pages, to look just the
                    same—only those minutely looking detecting the difference—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Inform the official people at once that the cancellation is to be made for future
                        editions.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a></p>
