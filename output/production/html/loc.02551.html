            <p class="tei_p">I am much annoyed about the postage mishap. I have written to the P. M. at New York,
                &amp; hope he will make restitution,—as the package was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not sealed</span> at ends, (only wrapt over &amp; tied, to protect the gilt

                    precisely the same way</span> (one or two to N.Y.) and this is the only one that
                has been served so. If the P.M. don't <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">restitute</span> I must be
                allowed to pay it—not because it is important, but because it is my

                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
