                <p class="tei_p">
                    The last I have heard of GARIBALDI'S movements was
                    that he was at the villa of his friend, the Marquis DE PALLAVICINI,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> in the neighborhood of Milan. This was on the 16th, the day
                    on which it was so confidently announced by his partisans in Florence that he
                    had crossed the Papal frontier. In the last number of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Figaro</span>, I find the following "physiology" of this remarkable man, by
                    M. VILLEMOT,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> which, though bordering on the caricature, is
                    so correct in many points that I think it will interest as well as amuse your
                    readers:</p>
                <p class="tei_p">"'Liberator' or 'heroical bungler' GARIBALDI is a
                    figure. Had I any disposition to believe in the supernatural he would have
                    converted me. Against all reason and human wisdom, and to the profound
                    humiliation of vulgar calculations, he has accomplished things which are to be
                    classed among miracles and legends. He is not a great captain; as a tactician he
                    is no better than JEANNE D'ARC,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> but like her he has a
                    familiar demon; he hears voices and takes the field. When he captures a throne
                    he seats himself upon it, eats a bunch of grapes and inquires after his goats.
                    He has not got a sou, and if he is a Chevalier of St. Maurice and
                    Lazare, he is profoundly ignorant of the fact.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Educated people say: 'You now see that he is nothing
                    but a rowdy; he may have a palace, receive diplomatic corps, and eat carp <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a la chambord</span>, but he loves best to live on a crust of
                    bread rubbed with garlic.' But GARIBALDI likes to be judged from the point of
                    view of his temperament, and on this side of the Alps he cannot be very well
                    understood. He is reproached with not dressing himself like M. ROUHER,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> and with
                    wearing a boatman's shirt, a slouched hat and a Scotch plaid. They accuse him,
                    moreover, of those turgidities of style which wound ears accustomed to the small
                    flute of the Academies. They forget that he is operating in the land of TASSO<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a>
                    and ARIOSTO,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">8</a> and if our genius induces us to the search after symplicity that of
                    Italy accommodates itself to a lyricism which with us is not in fashion except
                    in the minor drama.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">GARIBALDI is the expression of the land and the age
                    that gave him birth. You cannot get him to attire himself; you cannot get him to
                    express himself otherwise than is in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">hts​ </span></span> nature. In his general physiognomy there is a mixture of the prophet
                    and the child. Of our civilization, of our manners, of our vices and our crosses
                    he knows nothing. He marches ahead without seeing. He lives in an ideal <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">worlp​ </span></span>, and knows no more of the men of his time than a contemporary hero of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Iliad</span> rising from his dust.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">His innocence exceeds all belief. The following is an
                    example of it. A few years ago he said to a friend, 'You are aware that I gave
                    notes to M. ALEXANDER DUMAS<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">9</a> to write my memoirs from. Would you believe that he
                    has added to them a number of things of his own invention?'</p>
                <p class="tei_p">BRAVE GARIBALDI! Write not your memoirs and get no one
                    to write them. Let the people whom you have <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">fanatacised​ </span></span> compose your legend, and you will take your place among the great
                    Sphinxes of history."</p>

                    Whitman's intimates from the Pfaffian days. Restless and adventurous, Clapp
                    roamed to Paris, returned in the 1840s to Lynn, Massachusetts, to edit the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Essex County Washington</span> (later the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pioneer</span>), and eventually went to New York, where he became "king of
                    the Bohemians." As editor of the short-lived <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday
                        Press</span> (1858–1860), he printed Whitman's "A Child's Reminiscence"
                    ("Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"), and, in 1860, praised <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> when others condemned it. (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>, New York: The Macmillan Company,
                    1955, 242–244, 260–261). All told, more than twenty items on Whitman
                    appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> before the periodical folded in
                    1860. "Henry Clapp," Walt Whitman said to Horace Traubel, "stepped out from the
                    crowd of hooters—was my friend: a much needed ally at that time (having a
                    paper of his own) when almost the whole press of America when it mentioned me at
                    all treated me with derision or worse. If you ever write anything about me in
                    which it may be properly alluded to I hope you will say good things about Henry
                    Clapp" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>

                        May 30, 1888</a>," 236). Whitman also told Traubel, "You will have to know
                    something about Henry Clapp if you want to know all about me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in

                    to the newspaper article Clapp enclosed in this letter, Whitman replied: "I can see some of the
