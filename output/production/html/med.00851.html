            <p class="tei_p">Dear friend; and all your folks, all the family—I
                have been very ill for over a fortnight and still badly and weak yet—not yet
                quite definite—but the Doctor favors the probability. The heat is
                great—but in pulse and appetite things help me along; also in good
                spirits. Good remembrances and affection to you all.</p>
