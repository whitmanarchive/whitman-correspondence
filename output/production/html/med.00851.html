                    Scotland. According to Walker, her father and Whitman discussed "questions of

                    by several doctors at this time. Canadian physician and psychiatrist Richard
                    Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) had visited Whitman earlier in June, and in 1885
                    he had introduced Whitman to Sir William Osler (1849–1919), another
                    Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns Hopkins
                    Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Osler also visited
                    Whitman in June. For more on these doctors, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
