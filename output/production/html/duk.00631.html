                    or May 7, 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter about May 9?, 1873 (Walt
                    Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:217, n. 75), but it is more likely to date
                    two or three days earlier. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman instructed Walt Whitman to
                    send no more papers. Walt had enclosed two newspapers with his <a href="yal.00416">May 7, 1873</a> letter, but he never again forwarded
                    newspapers to his mother. The letter is unlikely to date to May 8, 1873 or
                    later: "I shall feel anxious until I hear from you," Walt wrote in his <a href="uva.00366">May 11, 1873</a> letter to his mother. Had Walt
                    received a letter a day or two before writing his, he would have been unlikely
                    to express such concern. So this letter from Louisa probably dates before May 8,
                    1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    letter to Walt, in which the shortness of the letter and deficient handwriting
                    suggest another and more serious episode followed. Louisa described the later
                    episode, probably a stroke, the following week: "my head and my very brain has
                    seemed to be affected" (see her <a href="duk.00610">May 13 or 14, 1873</a>
                    letter to Walt). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
