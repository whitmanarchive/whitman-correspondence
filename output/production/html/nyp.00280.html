                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, it is a dark cloudy day, &amp; raining hard—the darkies were to have a
                great celebration here to-day, in honor of emancipation—they turn out here in
                real good style, on such occasions—but it is too wet for them to-day—Mr. Stanbery is quite ill, as you see by the papers—The Impeachment trial
                still goes on—I went up, that day,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> but it was very crowded,
                &amp; the air was so bad, I left, &amp; went off &amp; had a real good tramp, way up
                Georgetown, along the banks of the river—it is beautiful along there, of a
                fine day—So you see I am still able to get around.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new in the office—the same old story—I have rec'd a
                number of papers from England with notices of my book, there—mostly friendly
                &amp; favorable—more so than any here<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—Mother, I am very sorry you have those pains in your
                face &amp; head<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—I shouldn't wonder if it was neuralgia—that is a
                violent inflammation of the nerves of the face &amp; head—Mrs. Mix<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> used to have it very bad—O, I
                forgot I believe to tell you Mrs. Mix is living yet—she had a very bad spell,
                but got over it—Mother, I have just got your letter of 14th—&amp; was
                glad to get it—I havn't seen William Velsor<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> for some time—will tell him when I see him—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I send a couple of papers same time with this—they are not much, but
                will do just for a change—poor old Uncle John<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—he is failing then
                at last—I suppose George<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> is well, &amp; having good times—I see him
                every day as I have his picture tacked up on the door of my desk in front—Good bye, dearest mother, &amp; take good care of yourself, &amp; dont work too
                hard.</p>

                    Whitman). On <a href="duk.00547">July 8, 1868</a>, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman wrote to Walt Whitman: "Mr Lane makes strait for george [when there is

                    continued to build houses on speculation. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
