            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I hear from you indirectly once in a while by Hoag,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
                (&amp; saw Debbie &amp; Jo<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> some days since)—I
                suppose you got the postal I sent you about 12 days ago<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—the weather has been so bad, or I should have come down—I have had
                quite a good deal to do writing—have finished quite a piece for a big magazine
                in N. Y.—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North American Review</span>—it was
                ordered—I get $100 for it—I read the proof last night &amp; sent it
                    off<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—then I have a little poem <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the Patrol at Barnegat</span> probably in next Harper's<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—(but I think I told you about it)—then
                to-day I am busy on another order<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—So you see I
                have something to do—I will send you the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Review</span> piece
                when printed—I am feeling better and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sassier</span> this
                winter so far than for some years, am very comfortable here, plain &amp; quiet
                though—eat my allowance every time—&amp; have a little jug of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good Jamaica rum</span> from which I take a sip now &amp;
                then—(but not very often)—came in chill'd &amp; dumpy late yesterday
                afternoon—made myself a good mug of hot rum, &amp; felt better—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Hank, I hope you are having fair times on the road—I am glad you stick to
                it—perseverance will conquer. Horner<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> was here
                again a few evenings ago, an hour—How do you get on with Col: Ingersoll's
                    book?<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> (You mustn't take too much stock in
                him)—If there is any book particular you want, you tell me, &amp; I will try
                to get it—Lots of sleighs out, good sleighing—my brother was out day
                before yesterday, &amp; got overturned—I wanted to go yesterday, but he was
                afraid for me to venture it—his nag is pretty lively, (but I should have liked
                that all the better)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">1½—just had dinner, hot soup, cold roast beef, apple pie—all
                good—the sun is out real warm, &amp; I shall go at my piece for the N Y
                order—it is for a lady, a friend of mine—she has been for years
                principal literary editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>, &amp; now she is
                going to start a paper of her own—pays me<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Is Ed<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> home? I should just like to have a ten mile ride
                behind his nag with the sleigh bells—Dear boy, I send you my best love &amp;
                dont you forget it—</p>
