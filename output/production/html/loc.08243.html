                Perfect weather continued—am feeling fairly—oysters for my breakfast—am
                getting the changed title &amp; other pp: necessary for the (really, doubtless final)
                ed'n L of G. 438 pp:  &amp; shall send you one, soon as ready, (probably two or three
                weeks yet)—y'r letters rec'd (short but sweet)—J W W[allace]'s 
                good letters rec'd too—expect T Williams &amp; an

                the N Y "Critic" Sept 5? If not I can send you one—

                a quite varied examination, result much more comforting than I anticipated (I have been
                dreading blindness or close on it)—T C will get more propitious glasses—(with
                these I have my sight blurs badly)—have had my supper with zest—appetite quite
