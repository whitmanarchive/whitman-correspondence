            <p class="tei_p">Horace call'd to say you w'd not start till Monday
                next—All right—nothing since f'm O'C[onnor], wh' is
                the most pressing matter with me now—I fear he is having a bad
                time—&amp; think of him much—Nothing very different or new in my
                affairs—my "cold in the head" still hangs on—some twinge of bladder
                trouble, but nothing serious—upon the whole am getting along pretty fairly I
                fancy—have a fancy, contemplation, of a small edition of L of G with Annex
                &amp; "Backward Glance," all bound in pocket-book style pretty well, probably
                morocco, edges cut pretty close—Have rec'd the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pall
                    Mall</span>, Jan: 25, with a long favorable notice of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov.
                        Boughs</span>—I sh'd send it now, but have lent it over to McKay to look at—shall keep it for you—no rec't yet of
                the German trans: book—Dr Karl Knortz has an
                office at 19 Dey St: New York not far from P O &amp; wants you to stop &amp; see him
                when you can.</p>

                to-day—My brother Jeff from St Louis (topographical
                engineer) here—(as he grows older, we look curiously alike—you would
                know he was my brother)—he is not well, stomach &amp; throat
                botheration—goes back to St Louis to-night—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Horace came last night with the tel[egram] that you w'd not start till next
                Monday—bowel action this mn'g—am sitting as usual by my stove—The
                enc: is f'm Ernest Rhys to me, nothing particular, but E
                R always cheery &amp; welcome—I guess A
                    Gardner, publisher, Paisley, Scotland, must have sent
                copies of his little ed'n <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: B.</span> around to English and
                Scotch editors—very good—I have sent y'r Sarrazin
                abstract to be put in type—Shall give it to you to read proof—no
                hurry—it is in some resp[ect]s the best thing said ab't us—</p>
