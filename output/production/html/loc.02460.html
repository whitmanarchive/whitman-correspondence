            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">By this mail I send you the current number of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Strand
                Magazine</span>—a new English periodical—mainly because it contains
                (p. 41) portraits of your old friend Tennyson, at two different
                periods of his life, which I thought might interest you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">J.W.W. called at my surgery this morning &amp; read to me the
                draft of a letter to you concerning Ruskin which I think will
                please you. This is the most sacred of days to him (JWW), being the anniversary of
                his mother's death, which was at once the greatest calamity of his life &amp; his
                most valuable experience <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02460.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02460.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02460.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                He was just returning from the cemetery where he had probably been placing a
                wreath upon her grave.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">It is a constant source of regret to his friends here that his health continues so
                indifferent—he is looking better tho' still complaining of a lack of nerve
                energy—this enforced absence form the Monday night weekly meetings of "The
                College" has been a misfortune for our little society of friends, among whom he is
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">facile princeps</span>, &amp; who are proud to acknowledge
                him Master.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"The dear fellow!" you exclaimed while reading the letter from him that I handed to
                you last July in your "Mickle St den." Yes, he <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span> a dear
                fellow! How dear &amp; how good no one knows better than I who am privileged to
                enjoy his closest personal <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02460.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02460.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02460.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> intimacy—He is a man of sterling worth &amp; his qualities
                of mind &amp; heart have endeared him to all who really <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> him—Few men 
                possess a better knowledge than he of what is
                essentially the highest &amp; best in Literature, or a more keen &amp; penetrating
                insight into the heart &amp; meaning of the Deliverances of the Great ones of Earth,
                the "conscience conserving, God inculcating, inspired achievers" the "powerful &amp;
                resplendent" poets, scientists &amp; seers of the glorious past &amp; the equally
                &amp; perhaps more glorious present.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">He is really an all round splendid fellow, intellectually &amp; morally. Gifted
                with a mind of a superior order he is endowed with an exalted moral nature &amp; has
                attained true nobility of character.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot tell you all he has been to me or how much <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02460.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02460.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02460.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I owe to his good influence; for he has
                been one of three good genii of my life—the other two being yourself &amp; my
                own, dear, good old father. I have no truer friend—our friendship originated
                in &amp; has been fused &amp; welded into intimate &amp;, I trust, life long
                cohesion mainly through our mutual love for you—and you have no warmer,
                whole-heart-and-soul-devoted admirer, appreciator &amp; lover than he.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Pardon my writing thus about my friend but "out of the abundance of the heart the
                mouth speaketh." &amp; I know that my words will need no
                apology to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> since it is in great measure thro' you that
                I have learned to appreciate &amp; love such as he.</p>
