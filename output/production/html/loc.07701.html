                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1832–1904) wrote from Washington, D. C. requesting permission to visit
                    Whitman. (The Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Traveller</span> on October 5, 1889,
                    however reprinted a purported letter from Arnold to Whitman dated September 12,
                    written from New York, in a flamboyant style not found in the actual letter.)
                    For an account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
                        Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering." Arnold
                    published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and
                        Lands</span> (1891), in which he averred that the two read from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis, knitting, a
                    handsome young man (Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at least two
                    additional accounts of Arnold's visit with Whitman; "Arnold and Whitman" was
                    published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Times</span> (Philadelphia, PA) on

                    (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. Arnold was best known for his long narrative

                    story and philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely responsible for

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
