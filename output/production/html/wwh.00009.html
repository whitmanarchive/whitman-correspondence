        <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Jeff,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just rec'd your letter, &amp; glad indeed to hear directly from you all. I hear
        through mother, but have been expecting a letter from Mat now for some time—Mother's letters are almost always mentioning
        Matty with love &amp; sympathy, &amp; fretting when she dont hear from her—Dear Mat, we all love her so much, &amp; think about her more
        than she knows—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am now working in another branch of the Department—have it easier—whenever
        you write direct to me—"<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solicitor's Office, Treasury</span>"
        Washington, D. C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just written a letter to Han—I write quite often, &amp;
        send papers, &amp;c—I shall write to mother this morning—Mother is quite alone
        there in the house, as the people down stairs have moved
        out—(George turned 'em out for impudence to mother)—I write every other day,
        &amp; send papers &amp; stuff—My next piece is to appear in the "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kansas Magazine</span>" for February—will be out very
        shortly—It is a new magazine, same style as the Atlantic—intended for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Western thought</span> &amp; reminiscences &amp;c—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Brother, &amp; dear Sister Matty, I should like to come on, according to your
        invitation, &amp; pay you a good visit, but it is doubtful this time—My bringing out a
        new book is only bringing out a new edition, from the stereotype plates, the same as the
        last—only in one Vol—as the edition printed a year ago is all
        exhausted—(But I stereotyped it, &amp; have all the plates in New York.) But I should
        like to have a good long visit home, &amp; be with mother—my getting leave does not
        work yet as I hoped—but I expect to fix it somehow, &amp; go home before very
        long—I am very well this winter—My book is flourishing in foreign lands at a
        great rate—I get letters from all parts of Europe—I believe I told you Tennyson
        had written me twice and very hearty &amp; friendly letters, inviting me to come &amp; be
        his guest, &amp;c—Then the professors in the Universities, Dublin &amp; elsewhere in
        Great Britain deliver lectures on "Leaves of Grass"—&amp;c—But <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span> the enemy have the ground mostly to themselves—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I suppose you see we have a new Attorney General—It
        doesn't seem to make much difference to me so far—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Jeff, did the photos I sent of mother &amp; me come to you, December?</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear sister Mat, &amp; Hatty &amp; California, love to you
        all—I am writing this at my desk, toward noon, very bright &amp; sunny, but cold
        enough—I often think of you all—Mat, when I go home I shall do my part at that
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cake</span> you speak of in letter to mother—Wm. O'Connor &amp; family have gone on a short trip to Cuba, to be back in three
        weeks—They are all well—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother told me the barrel of flour came safe—but it was too bad Mat's Christmas
        letter got lost—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Good bye to you for this time, Brother Jeff &amp; Matty dear,</span>
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt.</span>
      </span>

      
        <p class="tei_p">Mat, you write to mother often as you can—</p>
