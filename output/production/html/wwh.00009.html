      <p class="tei_p">I have just rec'd your letter, &amp; glad indeed to hear directly from you all. I hear
        through mother<a href="#n0705" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0705">2</a>, but have been expecting a letter from Mat<a href="#n0707" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0707">3</a> now for some time—Mother's letters are almost always mentioning
        Matty with love &amp; sympathy, &amp; fretting when she dont hear from her—Dear Mat, we all love her so much, &amp; think about her more
        than she knows—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am now working in another branch of the Department—have it easier—whenever
        you write direct to me—"<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solicitor's Office, Treasury</span>"
        Washington, D. C.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just written a letter to Han<a href="#n0285" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0285">4</a>—I write quite often, &amp;
        send papers, &amp;c—I shall write to mother this morning—Mother is quite alone
        there in the house, as the people down stairs<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">5</a> have moved
        out—(George turned 'em out for impudence to mother)—I write every other day,

        shortly—It is a new magazine, same style as the Atlantic—intended for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Western thought</span> &amp; reminiscences &amp;c—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Brother, &amp; dear Sister Matty, I should like to come on, according to your
        invitation, &amp; pay you a good visit, but it is doubtful this time—My bringing out a
        new book is only bringing out a new edition, from the stereotype plates, the same as the
        last—only in one Vol—as the edition printed a year ago is all
        exhausted—(But I stereotyped it, &amp; have all the plates in New York.) But I should
        like to have a good long visit home, &amp; be with mother—my getting leave does not
        work yet as I hoped—but I expect to fix it somehow, &amp; go home before very
        long—I am very well this winter—My book is flourishing in foreign lands at a
        great rate—I get letters from all parts of Europe—I believe I told you Tennyson
        had written me twice and very hearty &amp; friendly letters, inviting me to come &amp; be
        his guest, &amp;c—Then the professors in the Universities, Dublin &amp; elsewhere in
        Great Britain deliver lectures on "Leaves of Grass"—&amp;c—But <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span> the enemy have the ground mostly to themselves—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I suppose you see we have a new Attorney General<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a>—It
        doesn't seem to make much difference to me so far—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Jeff, did the photos I sent of mother &amp; me come to you, December?</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear sister Mat, &amp; Hatty &amp; California,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">8</a> love to you
        all—I am writing this at my desk, toward noon, very bright &amp; sunny, but cold
        enough—I often think of you all—Mat, when I go home I shall do my part at that
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cake</span> you speak of in letter to mother—Wm. O'Connor<a href="#n0452" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0452">9</a> &amp; family have gone on a short trip to Cuba, to be back in three
        weeks—They are all well—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother told me the barrel of flour came safe—but it was too bad Mat's Christmas
        letter got lost—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Good bye to you for this time, Brother Jeff &amp; Matty dear,</span>

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"

                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
                    Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
                    daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
                    the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat

                    Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>,
                    an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
                    assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he
                    went to Washington. O'Connor was one of Whitman's strongest defenders, most
                    notably in his 1866 pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" (a digital version of the
                    pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). The poet praised O'Connor in the
                    preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was born sample here in the
                    19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood.
                    Thrice blessed be his memory!" In 1872, while living in the O'Connors' home,
                    Whitman strongly disagreed with O'Connor over the Fifteenth Amendment, which
                    Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in
                    response William moved out. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r0452">back</a>]</li></ul>
