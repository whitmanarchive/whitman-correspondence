            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Lane is again very anxious about his boy, his name is Horace G. Tarr, and is Sergeant Major of the 20th Reg. of Connecticut Vol. If by chance you should hear anything of him will you please write. His Reg. belonged to the 12th army Corps, and I think were in the hottest of the fight. I sent you a letter last week with $14 in it and another yesterday with $10. Did you get them both? We are all well at home. The rejoicing in New York is sincere and almost universal and yet a few, (and yet only a few when compared with the immense city) who try to find some reason why Lee should have been whipped. Copperheads are getting out of circulation being laid up for a future contingency. Hope to hear from you soon. Dont forget me.</p>
