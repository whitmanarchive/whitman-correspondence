                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                    strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house for five years.
                    For the strained relationship, see Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's <a href="loc.00393">April 16, 1860</a> and <a href="loc.00400">March 3,
