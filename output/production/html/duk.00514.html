            <p class="tei_p">i thought
                i would just write a few
                lines and send you marys
                letter it would be so long
                to wait till next week
                i dident hardly know
                how to spare the envelope
                i have been looking over
                my stock and i find i have
                got three more i suppose
                you have got my letter 
                to day in answer to yours
                of sunday last) i am feeling
                pretty well yesterday
                i dident feel very well
                but to day i feel as well
                as usual poor aunt fanny
                all her savings and money
                will not avail her anything
                we had a real snow
                storm here this morning
                but it is cleared off now
                i have not heard from
                George
                since he went
                away so i suppose he
                is well and wont come
                now till the first of
                the month</p>

            <p class="tei_p">we had a visit yesterday
                from mr Brown of
                portland ave he was very
                clever looks about the
                same only better i think
                he has been out of work
                for a long time he says
                he has had some money
                from england that he had
                expected for a long time
                and it come very acceptable
                and willy and charlee
                works) i have had no
                more word from matty
                or hanny
                or any body
                but this of marys i dont
                know what i should doo
                if it wasent for letters
                i read the trial in the
                stars paper
                i was glad
                Johnson was acquitted
                i think it was right
                i dont seem to have much to write
                Walter dear this time
                but if you get any thing
                from england as you 
                expected i want to see
                it if you get more than
                one</p>
