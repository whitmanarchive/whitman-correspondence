In 1860 and 1867, it appeared as "Leaves of Grass" No. 11 and No. 3, respectively.  Given the circulation figures of the various editions, it is most likely that Brookfield quotes from the third edition of Leaves (1860), <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1881/clusters/199"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Autumn Rivulets</span> (1881)</a>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed.
