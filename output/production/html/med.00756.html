                Now though this great country is seen to deserve in many ways the
                wonder of mankind and is held to be well worth visiting, rich in all good
                things, guarded by large force of men, yet seems it to have held within
                it nothing more glorious than this man, nothing more holy marvellous
                and dear. The verses too of his godlike genius cry with a loud voice and set forth in such wise his glorious discoveries that he hardly

                It is vulgarly supposed that by "this great country" Lucretius
                meant <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Sicily</span> and by "this man" <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Empedocles</span>; but it is plain enough that
                he really meant America and Walt Whitman—Any one can see that
                "Vociferantur" must have been intended to apply to the "barbaric yawp".
                Isn't it so?

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    two pages of this letter have survived, it may be dated with some certainty. On
                    June 10, 1882, Whitman made the following entry in his Commonplace Book: "sent
                    letter to Dr Bucke, ab't 'motif' of his book / &amp; ab't printing in Phila"
                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman's letter to Bucke of June 10,
                    1882, is listed among the lost letters in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77), 3:437. If the normal pattern of delivery and
                    response was followed, Bucke would have received the letter on June 12, 1882,
                    and probably would have answered the same day. On June 17, 1882, Whitman wrote
                    to Rees Welsh &amp; Company of Philadelphia about the publication of Bucke's
                    book (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
                    1131). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00756_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_lozynsky tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00756_n2"><span>Since Whitman's letter
                    to Bucke is lost and Bucke's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> was published
                    without an epigraph, it is impossible to determine Whitman's "motto." Whitman
                    rejected the quotation from Lucretius (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">De Rerum Nature</span>,
                    1, ll. 726–33), and Bucke acquiesced (see the letter from Bucke to Whitman
                    of <a href="med.00709">May 28, 1883</a>). Bucke was, however, fond of the
                    quotation, and after Whitman's death he used it—in English—for the
                    title page of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re</span> (1893). It is important to note that
                    Bucke selected an epigraph from Lucretius, one of the most prominent of the
                    materialist philosophers. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
