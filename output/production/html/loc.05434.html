            <p class="tei_p">By what Overacre<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> would call an "exceedingly natural and extensive concatenation of
                radical causes," I begin thinking, now that I sit down to write to you, of the time
                and place that I used to hail from some eight or nine months ago. You no doubt
                remember those precious missives that sprang almost diurnally from my teeming hand
                at Purgatory Place.—But that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Place</span>! O, it makes my
                nerves quiver as I think of it.—Yes, anathema! anathema curse, curse upon thee
                thou fag end of all earthly localities, infernal Woodbury!<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> But I fear I am getting
                warm.—Let me push the subject no farther.—The fact is, the most distant
                mention of that diabolical region, that country of buckwheat dough-nuts, and
                pot-cheese, and rye sweet–cake, always makes me fall a
                swearing.—Faugh!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have you never in your travels come across a village where some half dozen principal
                characters seemed to give a colour and tone to the whole place? Of such a nature is
                this Whitestone, which your servant, now irradiates with <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01460_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gk.01460_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01460_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_gk.01460_large.jpg</span> the benign light of his
                countenance.—The principal feature of the place is the money making spirit, a
                gold-scraping and a wealth-hunting fiend, who is a foul incubus to three
                fourths of this beautiful earth.—Unfortunately, too, these "leaders" here, set
                but a poor example to the rest as regards their strict adherence to the domestick
                ties and institutions which old Madame Custom has planted and nourished and made at
                last so deeply rooted among us.—Enough of this however.—Do not think I
                am going to fall into the splenetic, fault-finding current, on which those
                Woodbury documents were set afloat.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am quite happy here; and when I say this, may I flatter myself that some chord
                within you will throb "I am glad to hear that?"—Yes, as far perhaps as it
                falls to mortal lot, I enjoy happiness here.—Of course, I build now and then
                my castles in the air.—I plan out my little schemes for the future; and
                cogitate fancies; and occasionally there float forth like wreaths of smoke, and
                about as substantial, my day dreams.—But, take it all in all, I have reason to
                bless the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01461_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gk.01461_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01461_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_gk.01461_large.jpg</span> breeze
                that wafted me to Whitestone.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are close on the sound.—It is a beautiful thing to see the vessels,
                sometimes a hundred or more, all in sight at once, and moving so gracefully on the
                water.—Opposite to us there is a magnificent fortification under
                weigh.—We hear the busy clink of the hammers at morn and night, across the
                water; and sometimes take a sail over to inspect the works, for you know it belongs
                to U.S.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My quarters are quite satisfactory too as regards boarding.—One of the windows
                of my room commands a pleasant view of the sound.—Another looks to the east
                and the great round face of the sun, <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_quantity_1 tei_gap_unit_word">[cut away]</span> he comes
                along in the morning, almost seems to kiss me with a loving kiss.—I am
                generally dressed and ready to receive him at his first appearance.—This said
                room of mine is something that I much value.—It is my sanctum sanctorum, which
                profane foot invadeth not.—Its hallowed precincts are forbidden ground to
                every she in the house, except for absolutely necessary entrances, which concern the
                vital well–being of its lord.—</p>

                    Jamaica, Long Island, New York in 1840, and he started "The Children's Retreat"
                    for Home Education. An advertisement for Overacre's educational program appeared
                    in the April 13, 1841, issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New York Tribune</span>, and
                    indicated that Overacre would receive a limited number of boys under twelve
                    years of age into his family, to "effect a thorough training of the faculties; a
                    seasonable and harmonious development of the moral, physical, and intellectual
                    powers." The ad also indicated that Overacre's "mode of discipline [was]
                    strictly parental," and that the Bible would be the primary source of "religious
                    principle and moral duty" ("Home Education," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New York
                        Tribune</span> [April 13, 1841], 3). Given that Overacre's "Children's
                    Retreat" is advertised in mid-April 1841 and Whitman mentions having seen papers
                    that printed news about the school, this letter almost certainly dates to May 4,
                    1841. Later, Jacob Overacre is listed as a teacher at the Mechanics' Institute
                    School in the 1851 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Manual of the Corporation of the City of

                    and "Devil's Den," he did not enjoy his time there. Walt Whitman Elementary
