                    15, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter March 15, 1867, but only the
                    letter "M" and day of the month "15" appear in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand.
                    March 15, 1867 fell on Friday, the day that Louisa wrote. Edwin Haviland Miller
                    cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New

                    with the death of Dr. Edward Ruggles, a close friend of the Whitman family, the
                    previous Sunday ("Obituary: Edward Ruggles, M.D.," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    "Mattie" Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his practice and
                    devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems." Walt Whitman
                    enclosed a copy of Ruggles' obituary with his <a href="duk.00644">March 19,

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
