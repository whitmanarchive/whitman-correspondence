            <p class="tei_p">I have just received your card,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> dated 28th September, and I am very glad to hear that
                you have had so pleasant a summer, and that you are in better health.<a href="#n0905" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0905">2</a> Long may you
                remain so, say I. Did you receive a letter I sent you some weeks ago, asking you to
                write four or six lines in an MS. poem by Walter Scott?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> Not hearing from you, I fear
                you have not received it. If you have not received it, may I send it to you again,
                when I will explain my wishes? It will only occupy you for five minutes. I spent a
                very pleasant hour yesterday with Lowell. We smoked the pipe of
                good-fellowship. Tennyson is in Sussex, quite well. I shall send him your card.</p>
