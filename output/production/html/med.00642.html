            <p class="tei_p">I have just received your card, dated 28th September, and I am very glad to hear that
                you have had so pleasant a summer, and that you are in better health. Long may you
                remain so, say I. Did you receive a letter I sent you some weeks ago, asking you to
                write four or six lines in an MS. poem by Walter Scott? Not hearing from you, I fear
                you have not received it. If you have not received it, may I send it to you again,
                when I will explain my wishes? It will only occupy you for five minutes. I spent a
                very pleasant hour yesterday with Lowell. We smoked the pipe of
                good-fellowship. Tennyson is in Sussex, quite well. I shall send him your card.</p>
