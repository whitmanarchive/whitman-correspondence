                seen it before—must be printing now from M.S.? I hope there is a lot more of
                it, it is one of the best, most original, prose things of yours I have seen so
                far. I have your letter of the 5th &amp; 6th. I fear you are not having a good time but it
                is a great comfort to me to know that you are at least being looked after—in
                this regard I feel sure nothing could be better than Baker
                &amp; Traubel and I think we are most fortunate in getting the
                assistance of these two young fellows. Yes, as you imagine I am indeed up to my eyes

                thing I am glad of—I have got over the engagement I had with Pardee to go to Chicago and shall be here all the time now and so on

                generally bright, refreshing showers from time to time—we are cutting our hay.
