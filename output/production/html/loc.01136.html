            <p class="tei_p">
                I am greatly
                surprised at the course
                Worthington has taken. He
                is a rascal &amp; should be
                punished. I see no course
                to take but to commence
                proceedings against him
                at once. If you desire it
                I will see a lawyer &amp; have
                the necessary papers drawn
                up. It would be better
                to sue him in Camden
                &amp; bring him there. I dare
                say that if a summary

                were served upon him he
                would be brought to his senses
                I don't know whether he could
                be proceeded against criminally.
                Why not ask your friend in
                Camden who defended Hunter,
                I forget his name. Or write
                to Ashton &amp; get his opinion
                on the whole matter. Either
                of them will no doubt gladly
                give you their opinion free.
                If I ask a lawyer here I
                should expect to fee him.
                I will undertake to raise 
                some money to put the
                matter through &amp; will put
                down $50 myself. I think
                I could raise some in

                Boston, through J.T. Fields.
                I do not want to go to Worthington
                &amp; ask for an explanation, or
                have any one else go, I want
                to slap a summary upon
                him at once. I can have
                the complaint made out for
                you to swear to &amp; sign, &amp; then
                when he puts in his answer we
                can see what defense he sets
                up. In the meantime while
                suit is pending an injunction
                can be served upon Worthington
                on stopping him from printing 
                &amp; selling the book. That could
                be done in a few days.
                An order would have to be

                obtained of the court
                in N.Y. compelling him to stop
                or show cause why he should
                not be stopped.

                Write me explicitly what
                you would have me do &amp; I will
                do it. Don't be afraid of the trouble
                in the cost of legal proceedings,
                your friends will see to that.
                If you do not want to write to
                Ashton or contact a lawyer in
                Camden, then I will do it here.

                    P.S. I saw a lot of those books at Legget
                    Brothers Bookstore last summer or spring &amp; I was
                    told either there or at Worthington's that
                    they were some of the Thayer &amp; Eldridge
                    stock bound up. I forgot who told me.
