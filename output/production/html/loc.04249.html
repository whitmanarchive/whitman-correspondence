                musician and gentleman; who, after expressing his warm admiration and affection for

            <p class="tei_p">I had then gone to Italy, but I at once wrote Mr. Harrison and soon received from him
                a very charming letter, expressing not only what he remembered of Tennyson's words,
                but also his own very deep feelings toward you, and giving me permission to forward
                the letter to our friend for you, which of course I did, and I have always
                understood that you received it; but I am surprised to see that in Lippincott's<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a>
                (foot-note to p 381) you quote, instead of this, from my husband's letter to our

            <p class="tei_p">We intensely enjoyed Mr. Harrison's "musical recitations," in which he accompanied
                the spoken words with chords and melodies, always reminding me of walking alone
                through the woods and hearing the wind in the branches of the trees, which to my
                fanciful imagination, whistled merrily, or moaned sadly, according to my
                thoughts.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Unfortunately Mr. Harrison's ill-health prevents his continuing his work or coming to
                America as he had hoped to do. He made me feel that we, your neighbors, were
                unappreciative and stupid when he sang your praises and said that one of his first
                pleasures upon arriving in America, would be to try to be admitted to your presence.
                I even planned silently to myself that after I returned home I would go over to
                Camden and pass your house in the hope of seeing you at your window. But your

                    (1857–1903) was the son of William Harrison, a manager of the English
                    Opera Company. He began acting as a teenager and quickly became a popular
                    reciter of poetry and drama, often accompanying himself on the piano with
                    atmospheric music. Among his repertoire was Walt Whitman's "Passage to India."
                    Harrison was diagnosed with tuberculosis in the 1880s, and until his death he
                    would spend most of the year in the Riviera and come to England for recitals
                    only during the summer months. In his final years, he devoted himself to
                    sketching and writing books of poetry–<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Hours of
                        Leisure</span> (1887), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">On the Common Chords</span> (1895), and

                    (1892). In this latter volume, Harrison devotes several passages to Whitman. For
                    Harrison's own account of his work, see Archibald Cromwell, "A Famous Reciter

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's

                    and Old-Age Memoranda," he does include a footnote "from an English letter,
                    summer of 1890, to J. C. T., jr., Philadelphia," and reprints a passage from
                    that letter affirming that Tennyson and "Mr. Harrison" in England both admire
                    Whitman's work; Whitman also quotes the writer of the letter as saying "There
                    are many fine things in W. W.'s writings, but I cannot help wishing he had put
                    them into prose, instead of into such rocky verse" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</span> 47 [March 1891], 381). </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.04249_n7 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.04249_n7"><span>On March 10, Horace Traubel
                    received a letter from Mr. Trautwine, which explains the confusion about his
                    remarks that Whitman had quoted in his footnote to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's</span> article. Traubel also notes that the letter from Harrison
                    that Mrs. Trautwine assumes Whitman received in fact never arrived. See Traubel,

                    that Whitman valued Mrs. Trautwine's letter ("She writes in a warm, generous,
                    friendly way: it is precious to me") and records Whitman's confirmation that he
                    had never received Harrison's letter (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in

                    Whitman had "cut out . . . Trautwine's note" in revising the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott</span>'s piece for publication in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My

                    Traubel to report that he had found the misplaced Harrison letter, and he
                    forwarded it to Traubel to show to Whitman; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> With Walt
