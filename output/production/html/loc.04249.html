                <span class="tei_salute">Mr. Walt Whitman,</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">In Montreux, Switzerland, a year ago, I had the great pleasure of meeting Clifford
                Harrison, an English "musical reciter," artist, poet,
                musician and gentleman; who, after expressing his warm admiration and affection for
                yourself, mentioned that he had heard Tennyson speak in much
                the same way.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My husband ("J.C.T. Jr") casually mentioned this in
                writing to a friend who at once replied saying he had a friend who knew you, and
                asking that we get from Mr. Harrison a more definite statement of what <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00386.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00386.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00386.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

Our
                friend believed that you would be gratified by such a message.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had then gone to Italy, but I at once wrote Mr. Harrison and soon received from him
                a very charming letter, expressing not only what he remembered of Tennyson's words,
                but also his own very deep feelings toward you, and giving me permission to forward
                the letter to our friend for you, which of course I did, and I have always
                understood that you received it; but I am surprised to see that in Lippincott's
                (foot-note to p 381) you quote, instead of this, from my husband's letter to our
                friend (it was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">from</span> not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">to</span>,
                J.C.T. Jr); and I therefore cannot help questioning whether you ever received Mr.
                Harrison's letter to me, which must have given you far more pleasure than my
                husband's very dubious applause, which indeed he never <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00388.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00388.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00388.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                eye, still less that of the public.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I value Mr. Harrison's letters and have been comforting my soul with the idea that
                you prized the one I refer to, so much that you wished to keep it; but I cannot
                understand why you did not quote directly from it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Is it possible that in all the delightful chaos of your home, Mr. Harrison's letter
                has been lost sight of? He is a man, whose natural refinement of both mind and
                temperment makes his love and praise, a thing to be grateful for, even by so great a
                poet as yourself; he used to say that your poems alone "took him out of doors," and
                though keenly susceptible himself to the beauty of rhythm, he used to smile
                compassionately when we objected to what we called the "rockiness" of your
                verses.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We intensely enjoyed Mr. Harrison's "musical recitations," in which he accompanied
                the spoken words with chords and melodies, always reminding me of walking alone
                through the woods and hearing the wind in the branches of the trees, which to my
                fanciful imagination, whistled merrily, or moaned sadly, according to my
                thoughts.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Unfortunately Mr. Harrison's ill-health prevents his continuing his work or coming to
                America as he had hoped to do. He made me feel that we, your neighbors, were
                unappreciative and stupid when he sang your praises and said that one of his first
                pleasures upon arriving in America, would be to try to be admitted to your presence.
                I even planned silently to myself that after I returned home I would go over to
                Camden and pass your house in the hope of seeing you at your window. But your
                message to me <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00392.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00392.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00392.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why should you not speak me?
                And why should I not speak to you?" emboldens me to ask
                whether my husband and I may not call upon you some day at your convenience. It
                would be a great treat to us and we will promise not to bore you.</p>
