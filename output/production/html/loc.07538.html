            <p class="tei_p">Yours came yesterday evn'g—Mrs. Stafford here
                    yesterday—Harry has the still same trouble with the
                throat—it gets neither worse [nor] better—H
                seems interested in what they call "politics"—he is I suppose greatly anxious
                ab't Harrison's election—the whole thing is mixed—I shall myself be
                content (following Epictetus's advice to those who watch the great games) with
                whoever the people <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">put in</span>—</p> 

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new or special in my affairs—I sit here ab't the same—Mr
                    Musgrove rec'd a note from our friend Harned this morning that after Monday next a new nurse &amp;
                help carer for me w'd be install'd—M has always been kind &amp; attentive to
                me—I suppose you have got the copy of Nov. B in
                    McKay's style of binding—McK has been (is) off N Y
                &amp; Boston ward "drumming"—is expected to come back to-day or
                to-morrow—Sorry indeed to hear such bad prospects of Pardee—I recd a few lines dated Oct 27 from O'C[onnor], also
                a postal from Mrs. O'C—the eye trouble still
                continued—lively letter in ab't the same as usual—kind, affectionate,
                &amp; sparkling. Horace comes unfailingly &amp; is a main
                reliance—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I feel half &amp; half—pretty fair bowel movements—no Osler for ten days—bright &amp; sunny to-day—Have been
                reading Matthew Arnold's "Heine"—also George
                Elliot on same—both good (but probably not
                exhaustive)—</p>
