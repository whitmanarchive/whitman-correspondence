            <p class="tei_p">I am now fairly settled down here for the summer, have pretty well caught up with my
                work and am looking forward to a pleasant summer. The weather lately is
                heavenly—just pleasant temperature, pure blue sky with a white cloud floating
                here and there, a cool fresh breeze blowing. The syringas are coming out and the
                first roses are showing in the rosebeds. It is the cream of the year and the place
                has never been quite so beautiful before. If you could only be here for a month! I
                think I told you that Mrs O'Connor<a href="#n4137" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4137">2</a> gave me a copy of
                    Harrington<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—I have read it with the deepest
                interest—the book shows immense ability but what

                interested me more than the story was to trace O'Connor<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">4</a> as he then was in the
                background of the narrative. I was greatly interested to see that even in '60 he
                knew his L. of G. He must have had it almost or quite from the first (from '55).</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At the back of the book (Harrington) the Thayer &amp; Eldridge<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a> L. of G. ('60) is advertised, and below another book,
                by same author, is announced, viz: "Banner at Daybreak."<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a>
                Your idea at that time seems to have been to print successive books in the way of
                the usual writer.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have just received a letter from my brother Eustace<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a> of Ottawa
                containing this comical passage "I was told by a lady here last Sunday that Walt
                Whitman was living with his wife in a wretched hovel in the States in great poverty
                and neglect—she supposes that as soon as he is dead they will raise a great
                monument to him, and spend thousands of dollars on a grand funeral" Eustace laughed
                at the good lady and relieved her mind upon some of the above points.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

"Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913) was the
                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
