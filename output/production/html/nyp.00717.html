            <p class="tei_p">Yr's of 9th just come;—Whittier's poetry stands for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">morality</span> (not its <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ensemble</span> or in any true
                philosophic or Hegelian sense but)—as filter'd through the positive
                Puritanical &amp; Quaker filters—is very valuable as a genuine utterance &amp;
                very fine one—with many capital local &amp; yankee &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">genre</span> bits—all unmistakably hued with zealous partizan anti-slavery
                coloring. Then all the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">genre</span> contributions are
                precious—all help. Whittier is rather a grand figure—pretty lean &amp;
                ascetic—no Greek—also not composite &amp; universal enough, (don't wish
                to be, don't try to be) for ideal Americanism—Ideal Americanism would probably
                take the Greek spirit &amp; law for all the globe, all history, all rank, the
                19/20ths called evil just as well as the 1/20th called good (or moral)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The sense of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mannahatta</span> means <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the
                    place around which the hurried </span>(<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">or feverish</span>) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">waters are continually coming or
