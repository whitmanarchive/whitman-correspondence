                    (1838–1865) was raised by an abolitionist father, Amasa Soule, who moved
                    the Soule family to Kansas to help fight for Kansas's anti-slavery status. With
                    his father and brother William, Silas was a member of the "Jayhawkers," a band
                    of abolitionists who assisted slaves through the Underground Railroad. Silas was
                    among the Kansas team assembled and brought to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania by
                    Richard Swinton to break John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron
                    Stevens out of jail in Charlestown, Virginia (now West Virginia). In Harrisburg
                    he would have met William W. Thayer, who helped Richard Hinton and Thomas
                    Wentworth Higginson plan the jailbreak. On February 18, 1860, Soule went to
                    Charlestown from Harrisburg and faked public intoxication in order to be
                    imprisoned in the same jail as Hazlett and Stevens, only to be talked out of the
                    jailbreak by them. Soule attended a public memorial for Hazlett and Stevens in
                    Boston, where Thayer and Eldridge were in attendance. After the death of his
                    father in 1860, Soule followed the gold rush to Denver, but enlisted in the
                    Union army as soon as news of the war reached him. In 1864 Soule defied orders
                    by refusing to join Colonel John M. Chivington's attack on a group of unarmed
                    Native Americans, which later came to be known as the Sand Creek Massacre. Soule
                    would later testify against Chivington in hearings in Denver. Soule married
                    Hersa Coberly, the daughter of a pioneer family, on April 1, 1865. Three weeks
                    later he was murdered on the streets of downtown Denver by a private from the
                    Second Colorado infantry and an accomplice. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00586_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00586_n2"><span>Organized by the territory's

                    governor's involvement in their organization, the regiment marched to northern
                    New Mexico from February 1862 to March 1862. There they fought in the battles of
                    Apache Canyon and Pigeon's Ranch (also called the Battle of Glorieta Pass) and
                    at Peralta, New Mexico. Their first colonel was John P. Slough, who resigned and
                    was replaced by Major John M. Chivington in April 1862. The regiment's first and
