                    we spoke of Mr. Ruskin's<a href="#n3013" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3013">19</a> critic, we did not argue the case
                    between the two men. One is a practical painter who has undoubted genius, and he
                    certainly knows what he is talking about. He thinks that Mr. Ruskin has mistaken
                    notions about art; and we fear you will find that very many artists share that
                    opinion. For our own part, we are pagan enough to say that we do not very much
                    care even if any one tells us that Mr. Ruskin knows nothing about brushes and
                    pigments. His prose is an abiding glory and delight; and, as to the question of
                    his practical ability, we are very well content to let the artists fight it out
                    among themselves. You are quite right—the critic is born, not made.
                    By-the-way, you speak of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Whitman's</span><a href="#n16" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r16">20</a> critical powers. Do you know that he is one
                    of the most exquisitely delicate of literary critics? Some of his judgments on
                    such men as Carlyle,<a href="#n4301" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4301">21</a> Longfellow,<a href="#n0367" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0367">22</a>

                    Edgar Allan Poe,<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">26</a> and even Homer<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">27</a> and 
                    Shakspere,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">28</a> seem 
                    to us almost flawless. In your list of critics you do not
                    mention Matthew Arnold.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">29</a> Had it not been for Arnold's
                    most heartbreaking affectation, he would have been among the highest; but he
                    spoiled himself by writing in a fashion which, although it was often felicitous,
                    was more often insufferable. You mention 
                    Schlegel.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">30</a> Name of fear! We wish the
                    Germans had never seen Shakspere, 
                    and we wish that a serious accident would irrevocably destroy all the
                    works of all the commentators. When a man writes a learned essay to prove that
                    Macbeth was the third murderer, we have got quite far enough.</p>

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
