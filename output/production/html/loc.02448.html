                    paragraphs anent the Ingersoll Lecture. By their refusal to
                    let the Hall the Philadelphians have belittled themselves in the eyes of all
                    good men and true, and their attempt to stifle free discussion shews that the spirit of intolerance and the narrow-minded ecclesiasticism
                    which consigned Giordano Bruno to the 
                    stake still survives in your "City of

                    in the discussion or rather friendly talk, which followed prompted J. W. W. to
                    write a "Rejoinder" which he requested me to read to the friends on Monday night
                    last (Oct 20<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>) when we had another delightful

                    D<span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">awson</span>.—When
                    we spoke of Mr. Ruskin's critic, we did not argue the case
                    between the two men. One is a practical painter who has undoubted genius, and he
                    certainly knows what he is talking about. He thinks that Mr. Ruskin has mistaken
                    notions about art; and we fear you will find that very many artists share that
                    opinion. For our own part, we are pagan enough to say that we do not very much
                    care even if any one tells us that Mr. Ruskin knows nothing about brushes and
                    pigments. His prose is an abiding glory and delight; and, as to the question of
                    his practical ability, we are very well content to let the artists fight it out
                    among themselves. You are quite right—the critic is born, not made.
                    By-the-way, you speak of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Whitman's</span> critical powers. Do you know that he is one
                    of the most exquisitely delicate of literary critics? Some of his judgments on
                    such men as Carlyle, Longfellow,
                        Emerson, Scott, Whittier, 
                    Edgar Allan Poe, and even Homer and 
                    Shakspere, seem 
                    to us almost flawless. In your list of critics you do not
                    mention Matthew Arnold. Had it not been for Arnold's
                    most heartbreaking affectation, he would have been among the highest; but he
                    spoiled himself by writing in a fashion which, although it was often felicitous,
                    was more often insufferable. You mention 
                    Schlegel. Name of fear! We wish the
                    Germans had never seen Shakspere, 
                    and we wish that a serious accident would irrevocably destroy all the
                    works of all the commentators. When a man writes a learned essay to prove that
                    Macbeth was the third murderer, we have got quite far enough.</p>
