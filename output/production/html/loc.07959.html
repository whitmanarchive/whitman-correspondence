            Thank dear J W W[allace] for his cheery pen picture 
                (in letter of the old sea shore farm house to which you &amp; the rest 
                went for y'r outing)—I am still holding out ag't the heat &amp; other lesions—pretty bad—but 
                as I just told Warry,
                If they get their backs up we must show we can get our backs up too—
            </p>
