         <p class="tei_p">Well here we are again back to old Kaintuck and glad enough we are to get back I can tell you.
         </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother it is a long, long, while since I have had a letter from you, but I hope and trust that you and Mattie, the babies, and all the rest of you are in good health and spirits.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">The last letter I received from Walt was written July 17th. Walt seems to be getting along very well and I have no doubt he is doing a great deal of good in the Hospitals at Washington. He says you have not heard from Hannah lately,  Mother as soon as you hear from her <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​

I have been perfectly healthy all through the Vicksburg campaign although there has been considerable sickness in our regt, especially during the last two weeks of our stay at Milldale. We only lost three men by sickness, but the deaths in some of the new regts was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">frightfull​ </span><span class="tei_corr">frightful​

      </span></span> after the body of her son, which she said was the seventh she had lost during the war. Six had been killed in battle, and this one <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">makeing​ </span><span class="tei_corr">making​

         <p class="tei_p">We struck camp at Milldale Miss. August 6th and marched down to the Yazoo river, where we went on board the boat, and started down the Yazoo, to the Mississippi, and then turned up the Miss. towards Cairo, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Illanois​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Illinois​
        
      </span></span>. We landed a short time at Hellena Ark, Memphis, Tenn. and reached Cairo, on the morning of Aug 12th where we took the cars for <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Cincinnatti​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Cincinnati​
        
      </span></span>, Ohio  arrived at <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Cincinnatti​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Cincinnati​
        
      </span></span> about 3 O clock P.M. Aug 14th  marched to the 5th St. Market house where the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">citazens​ </span><span class="tei_corr">citizens​
        
      </span></span> had prepared a nice meal for us,  after getting our grub we crossed the river and encamped at this place. We will <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">probaly​ </span><span class="tei_corr">probably​
        
      </span></span> leave here in the course of a few days, and go to some other part of the State. Some think we will be sent to Tennessee but I think the probabilities are that we will stay somewhere in Ky. for a while to recruit up a bit, as the regt is pretty well used up. We were paid this afternoon up to the 1st of July and tomorrow I shall send you by Express, at least 175 dollars. I see by the papers that Spinnolas command is in Virginia so I suppose Andrew did not go to Newbern,  We had pretty hard fare while we were down in Miss. but now we are <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">liveing​ </span><span class="tei_corr">living​

      </span></span> to get such headway in the City of New York,  it strikes me that it would have been a good idea to have taken Fernando and Ben Wood Gov Seymour and a few more of the wire pullers and strung them up to one of the trees in the city Hall park. what a pity it is that 4 or 5 of the old regts, had not of been there to of straightened things up a bit,  as for myself I would have went into that fight with just as good a heart, as if they had belonged to the rebel army.

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, you may expect to get 175 or 180 dollars nearly as soon as you receive this,  use what you want of it and put the rest in the bank. I shall write to Walt in the course of a day or two,  write soon  direct to Kentucky via <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Cincinnatti​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Cincinnati​
