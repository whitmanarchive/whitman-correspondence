         <p class="tei_p">The last letter I received from Walt was written July 17th. Walt seems to be getting along very well and I have no doubt he is doing a great deal of good in the Hospitals at Washington.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> He says you have not heard from Hannah lately,  Mother as soon as you hear from her <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span></span> fail to send me word how she is getting along, and I hope to hear that she is (at least) well enough to come home. I have been perfectly healthy all through the Vicksburg campaign although there has been considerable sickness in our regt, especially during the last two weeks of our stay at Milldale. We only lost three men by sickness, but the deaths in some of the new regts was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">frightfull​ </span></span>. One woman came on there from <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Michagan​ </span></span> after the body of her son, which she said was the seventh she had lost during the war. Six had been killed in battle, and this one <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">makeing​ </span></span> the Seventh, had died of fever and was burried near our camp. I sent you a letter from Milldale, just after our chase after Johnson (did you get it)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> and now, since we have got back to a <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00344.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00344.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00344.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">duk.00344.002_large.jpg</span><span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">civalized​ </span></span> country, I will write you often.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We struck camp at Milldale Miss. August 6th and marched down to the Yazoo river, where we went on board the boat, and started down the Yazoo, to the Mississippi, and then turned up the Miss. towards Cairo, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Illanois​ </span></span>. We landed a short time at Hellena Ark, Memphis, Tenn. and reached Cairo, on the morning of Aug 12th where we took the cars for <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Cincinnatti​ </span></span>, Ohio  arrived at <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Cincinnatti​ </span></span> about 3 O clock P.M. Aug 14th  marched to the 5th St. Market house where the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">citazens​ </span></span> had prepared a nice meal for us,  after getting our grub we crossed the river and encamped at this place. We will <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">probaly​ </span></span> leave here in the course of a few days, and go to some other part of the State. Some think we will be sent to Tennessee but I think the probabilities are that we will stay somewhere in Ky. for a while to recruit up a bit, as the regt is pretty well used up. We were paid this afternoon up to the 1st of July and tomorrow I shall send you by Express, at least 175 dollars. I see by the papers that Spinnolas command is in Virginia so I suppose Andrew did not go to Newbern,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>  We had pretty hard fare while we were down in Miss. but now we are <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">liveing​ </span></span> first rate,  we get plenty of bread and good butter, Eggs, milk, peaches, Melons, tomatoes, and all that kind of thing. Mother as soon as you get this write and let me know just how you are all getting along.</p>

Hattie I suppose is flourishing the same as usual. write to me Matt when you get a chance.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, you may expect to get 175 or 180 dollars nearly as soon as you receive this,  use what you want of it and put the rest in the bank.

                    however, was of no immediate use to Burnside, since it had suffered heavy losses

                    13–15, 1863, the city was disrupted by riots over the application of the
                    1863 Conscription Act. The disturbance began in the Ninth Ward and spread
                    quickly to other parts of the city. It was precipitated, for the most part, by
                    Irish laborers who feared that the draft law would particularly afflict their
                    ranks because few Irishmen could afford to hire substitutes for their military
                    service or pay the $300 commutation fee. They envisioned that while they
                    were compelled to fight to free Negroes from slavery, that same group would then
                    be available to offer unfair competition in the labor market by accepting jobs
                    at reduced wages. Hence, whereas the riots began as a protest against the draft
                    generally, this cause was soon replaced by anti-Negro sentiment. The city's
                    police force was unable to quell the riots, and order was restored to the city
                    only when Union troops from Gettysburg arrived. Discussing the riots in a letter
                    to Walt Whitman, dated July 9, 1863, Jeff wrote: "I'm perfectly rabid on an
                    Irishman. I hate them worse than I thought I could hate anything. Their conduct
                    for the past week has made me do it" (Feinberg Collection of Walt Whitman,
                    Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00344_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Loving tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00344_n6"><span>Fernando Wood, mayor of

                    federal government and his duty as the governor of New York to restore order to
                    New York City. He asked Lincoln for a postponement of the draft until its
                    constitutional legality could be determined in the courts. This Lincoln
                    refused. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00344_n8 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Loving tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00344_n8"><span>See George Washington
