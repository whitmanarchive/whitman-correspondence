                    from Whitman to Thomas Donaldson of <a href="tex.00448">November 9,
                        1885</a>) was a neighbor of Whitman, living at 534 Mickle Street, and
                    often acted as the poet's driver. On December 12, 1885, he moved to Westmont,
                    near Haddonfield, N.J. On May 1, 1886, he came "to 328 [Mickle Street] to board"
                    and "left in early June" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.). On July 18 he became a "news agent" on the railroad train,
                    but was laid off early in September for a short period of time (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book). About this time he began to make notes about Whitman's
                    activities, and on December 27 he asked Richard Maurice Bucke whether he wanted
                    "my collection of notes about him." In his jottings Duckett observed that
                    Whitman "was entirely free from indelicacy or any unchastity whatever"; he
                    struck out the phrase "in any form" which originally followed "unchastity." On
                    November 28 he noted that he had driven to the cemetery "where the poets beloved
                    mother and little nephew are buried. It was his costume to visit there graives
                    every few days" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection, the Library of Congress). There
                    is a picture of Whitman and Duckett in October 1886 in Donaldson's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> (New York: Francis P. Harper [1896],
                    172). See also Whitman's letter to Richard Maurice Bucke of January 31, 1891 for
                    Whitman's later difficulties with the young man. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
