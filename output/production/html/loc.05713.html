                about as usual, &amp; nothing new in my affairs. Susan this will be a mean short
                letter this time—better luck next time—It is heavy and bad outside, the
                wind blowing a gale—(I should like to put on my overshoes &amp; old overcoat
                &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">go off in the woods</span> for an hour or two)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I havn't heard from Deb—I hope she is all
                right—Well, bad as the weather is, I must up &amp; go out &amp; across the
                river, or I shall have the horrors. The Lord A'mighty bress you all—good bye.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Am quite well with the exception of the abcess on my neck, it has come again. Dr.
                B— lanced it few days ago but it dont appear to get much better.
                Recieved the papers and am glad to get them for it is the only way I can get posted.
                Most of my friends appear to have forgotten me or think me of too little importance
                to drop a line.
            Will leave here the first of next month and start for Detroit where I will put
                in a month or so if I can find bread and butter. Please send me a letter of
                introduction to someone there if you know any body it will make it much better for me
                and I will not feel entirely alone. I think perhaps Dr. B can give me a letter to
                some of his friends there as he is going to give a lecture there Wednesday evening.
                Don't get the blues worth a dam and dont expect to. Will close for the present.</p>
