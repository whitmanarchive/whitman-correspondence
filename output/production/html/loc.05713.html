                B—<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> lanced it few days ago but it dont appear to get much better.
                Recieved the papers and am glad to get them for it is the only way I can get posted.
                Most of my friends appear to have forgotten me or think me of too little importance
                to drop a line.
            Will leave here the first of next month and start for Detroit where I will put
                in a month or so if I can find bread and butter. Please send me a letter of
                introduction to someone there if you know any body it will make it much better for me
                and I will not feel entirely alone. I think perhaps Dr. B can give me a letter to
                some of his friends there as he is going to give a lecture there Wednesday evening.
                Don't get the blues worth a dam and dont expect to. Will close for the present.</p>

                    was the father of Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in
                    Camden. Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White
                    Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several

                    staying with Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician and
                    psychiatrist. Bucke grew close to Whitman after reading (and later memorizing)
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 and meeting the poet in
                    Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke claimed in 1872 that a
                    reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him to experience "cosmic
                    consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany. Bucke became the poet's
                    first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David
                    McKay, 1883), and he later served as one of his medical advisors and literary
                    executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson,
