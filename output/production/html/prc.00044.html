                    <p class="tei_p">After the first printing of the 1876 edition was exhausted, there was a delay
                        until Whitman had 600 additional copies printed (see Whitman's <a href="loc.02838">September 1, 1876</a> letter to William Michael
                        Rossetti). This note undoubtedly was the draft of a letter which Whitman
                        sent to those people who had to wait for the second printing.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
