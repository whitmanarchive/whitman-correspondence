                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday your post-card<a href="#n5002c" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5002c">1</a> &amp; your very welcome books reached me. I spent a good part
                of the day over Two Rivulets,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">2</a> the Preface, &amp; the Memoranda of the War,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">3</a>
                &amp; was not far from you, I think, in feeling, however separated in place. I seem to see some gains from the 
                illness which has grieved us. Tones &amp; tints have passed from it into your writings which add to their 
                comprehensiveness &amp; their truth &amp; tenderness. At the same time I hold to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span>
                &amp; accept it,—taking it as a whole,—with entire satisfaction. It seems to me more for the soul, &amp; 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01497.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01497.002_large.jpg</span> 
                for things beyond physiology than you, contrasting it with your projected songs more specially for the soul, 
                quite recognize. The non-moral parts of it, such parts as simply are the "tally" of nature are taken 
                up into other portions of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span> &amp; are spiritualized; &amp; each part belongs 
                to the other. In <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span> I find a complete man, not body alone, or chiefly, but body 
                &amp; soul. That its <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">direct</span> tendency (&amp; not alone its indirect) is to invigorate 
                &amp; reinforce the soul I feel assured. But in contrast to the pride &amp; buoyancy, &amp; resonant tones of 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span> the tenderer, more penetrating, more mystic &amp; withdrawn tones of 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Passage to India</span>,<a href="#n0465" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0465">4</a> &amp; of the recent poems &amp; prose seem to 
                me to be a gain, as serving the same, &amp; not other, purposes but for other <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">moments</span>,

            <p class="tei_p">At present I have little doubt you ought not to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">set yourself</span> to any brain-work, 
                but at the same time you ought not to think of ceasing to write, for every now &amp; again the mood will come, 
                &amp; you will write something as admirable as anything you have written heretofore. Your friends here want to 
                think of you as free from all pressure to write, &amp; anxieties about material well-being, with your spirit 
                open to all pleasant &amp; good influences the Earth, &amp; the Season, &amp; your own thoughts bring to you.

                relieve us from some of this dissatisfied feeling on your behalf. Ought it not to be a duty, too, of—not the 
                American public to recognize your gift to America as a writer but—the American Government to recognize your 
                services, as of one who saved the lives, &amp; lightened the sufferings of many American citizens—It would be 
                honourable to the Government &amp; to you. I write knowing little of the actual probability of this, but I believe 
                in England we would be careful of such a voluntary public servant.</p>

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    was Whitman's attempt to "celebrate in my own way, the modern engineering masterpieces
                    . . . the great modern material practical energy &amp; works," including
                    the completion of the Suez Canal (1869), the Union and Central Pacific transcontinental 
                    railroad (1869), and the completion of the Atlantic Cable (1866) (see Whitman's <a href="col.00002">April 22, 1870</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway). Although Whitman

                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person</span> (1871),
                    123: "The manuscript of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Passage to India</span> was refused by
                    the monthly magazines successively in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and
                    London." The poem was eventually included in the final three editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, published in 1871, 1881, and 1891.

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
