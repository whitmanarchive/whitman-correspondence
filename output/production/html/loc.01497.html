                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday your post-card &amp; your very welcome books reached me. I spent a good part
                of the day over Two Rivulets, the Preface, &amp; the Memoranda of the War,
                &amp; was not far from you, I think, in feeling, however separated in place. I seem to see some gains from the 
                illness which has grieved us. Tones &amp; tints have passed from it into your writings which add to their 
                comprehensiveness &amp; their truth &amp; tenderness. At the same time I hold to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span>
                &amp; accept it,—taking it as a whole,—with entire satisfaction. It seems to me more for the soul, &amp; 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01497.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                for things beyond physiology than you, contrasting it with your projected songs more specially for the soul, 
                quite recognize. The non-moral parts of it, such parts as simply are the "tally" of nature are taken 
                up into other portions of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span> &amp; are spiritualized; &amp; each part belongs 
                to the other. In <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span> I find a complete man, not body alone, or chiefly, but body 
                &amp; soul. That its <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">direct</span> tendency (&amp; not alone its indirect) is to invigorate 
                &amp; reinforce the soul I feel assured. But in contrast to the pride &amp; buoyancy, &amp; resonant tones of 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G.</span> the tenderer, more penetrating, more mystic &amp; withdrawn tones of 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Passage to India</span>, &amp; of the recent poems &amp; prose seem to 
                me to be a gain, as serving the same, &amp; not other, purposes but for other <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">moments</span>, 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01497.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                other moods &amp; natures,—&amp; I think many of your future readers may gain an entrance to your earlier 
                writings through your later &amp; that for some persons this will be the fittest way—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At present I have little doubt you ought not to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">set yourself</span> to any brain-work, 
                but at the same time you ought not to think of ceasing to write, for every now &amp; again the mood will come, 
                &amp; you will write something as admirable as anything you have written heretofore. Your friends here want to 
                think of you as free from all pressure to write, &amp; anxieties about material well-being, with your spirit 
                open to all pleasant &amp; good influences the Earth, &amp; the Season, &amp; your own thoughts bring to you. 
                The Newspaper paragraph you sent Rossetti &amp; me has made us 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01497.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01497.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                fear it may not be so with you, &amp; we remain in suspense as to whether we might not make some move which would 
                relieve us from some of this dissatisfied feeling on your behalf. Ought it not to be a duty, too, of—not the 
                American public to recognize your gift to America as a writer but—the American Government to recognize your 
                services, as of one who saved the lives, &amp; lightened the sufferings of many American citizens—It would be 
                honourable to the Government &amp; to you. I write knowing little of the actual probability of this, but I believe 
                in England we would be careful of such a voluntary public servant.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well, my wife &amp; children &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span>.</p>
