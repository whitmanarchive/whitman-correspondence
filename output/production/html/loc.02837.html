      <p class="tei_p">I forward you by Express to-day, same address as this letter the package of Books (see list on other side)â€”I wish Tennyson to have a set &amp; have enclosed one, &amp; would ask you to do me the favor of seeing that it is 
        safely transmitted to him. Notwithstanding the disclaimer in yours of April 28 I also send 
        a set for Richard Bentley in response to his kindness &amp; generosity: (if any thing I know not of prevents 
        its reaching him, I wish <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> to keep it for yourself.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Please see that the photograph is given to the School of Art, with my affectionate respects.

      <p class="tei_p">Trusting to your kindness to see that they are carefully sent to the subscribers.
