                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
                    the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
                    (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace

                    dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
                    addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
                    arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07303_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07303_n3"><span>Whitman had recently gotten

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
                    outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
                    capital investors."

                    has been added below Bucke's signature in an unidentified hand, is almost
                    certainly associated with the poet's birthday dinner; some of them were part of
                    the planning committee for the event, while others would serve as speakers.
                    Artem Lozynsky theorizes that "the list represents the names of those to whom
                    Whitman intended to present copies of the 1889 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—the 'Birthday Book'" since Traubel suggested
                    this idea to Whitman, who seemed to be in favor of the plan (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Letters of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman</span>, ed. Artem
                    Loyzynsky [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1977], 127n2. Traubel writes,
                    "I proposed that he [Whitman] give copies of the Birthday Book to the main
                    speakers, and he instantly took hold of the idea. 'Yes—that would mean
                    Clifford, Tom, Herbert, Frank Williams, perhaps the Colonel—who else?'"
