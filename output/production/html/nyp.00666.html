            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for the card from N[elly]—so glad even that it is
                well as it is. Every thing goes on with me same as
                    before—McKay has just been here &amp; paid me $55.64
                for royalties of last six months—I am going to print a small special ed'n of L
                of G. with Sands at Seventy &amp; Backward Glance as epilogue &amp; am busying
                myself at it (to commemorate my finishing my 70th year)—</p>
