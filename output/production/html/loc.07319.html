            <p class="tei_p">I wrote a note this morning and this evening have received yours of 16<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> enclosing
                Fanny M. Grunde's quite affecting little letter and Mrs Spaulding's card. You ask me
                whether there is any thing I desire Ed. to bring me from Camden. I do not know that
                there is except the pictures wh I mentioned in mine of this morning. I mean the
                little collection of Photo's and engravings which you are about issuing. I suppose
                you do not want to send me that 1872 L. of G. ? And I do not want you to send it
                untill you are quite ready—but do not<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00644.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00644.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00644.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                let somebody else carry it off! I suppose you never found that copy of Harrington? I
                have never been able to get a copy and it seems as if I never should get one. Yes, I
                think we may flatter ourselves that L. of G. has got a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">locus
                    Standi</span> at last. No one now (unless inspired by ignorance as well as
                stupidity) can hoot at the book as the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">uncu'guid</span> thought
                well to do awhile ago. L. of G. has come to stay and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span>
                be seriously considered by all serious men henceforth whether they like it or
                whether they don't—what the outcome of the consideration will be (on the
                whole) I for one have no fear. I asked you this morning whether you had a man
                engaged in Ed's place—I hope you will tell me this as I am anxious about
                it</p>
