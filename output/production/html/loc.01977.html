            <p class="tei_p">I send you an order for 39/= for a copy of your works the $10 edition. If the amount does not cover the cost of 
                mailing pray let me know I will send it. I hope you will write your name in the volumes.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I hear of you occasionally through Mr. Dowden. You may suppose that I often dwell with pleasure 
                upon that little visit I paid you in Washington now nearly 4 years ago.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you could see all the people—all the free young men, and pure women—here who take pleasure in &amp;

                Not that they are very numerous, but I think you would take greater pleasure from the kind of people who care for you

            <p class="tei_p">I wish you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="could​ ">cd</span>​  have been at, or that it could be pictured to you, a 
                meeting of a literary society I attended last Monday evening where a "gentleman" made 
                a most ignorant &amp; savage attack on your writings. I wish you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="could​ ">cd</span>​

                feeling the very same passages from your works which the lecturer (a coarse Man of the world) had read as 
                words—make all clear &amp; beautiful what was before

                coarse nonsense. I must say that I only know Mr Dowden casually—a person of my world cannot aspire to 
                much acquaintance with a man whom I know to be so much in advance of me in every respect. My knowledge of 
                literature is very slight—I have not the critical insight into things that he has</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, I am sorry to hear of your not being well. Is there no chance of our ever seeing you at <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aja tei_unclear_cert_medium">this side</span>? I hope 
                I will again see you in any case.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Life appears to me increasingly beautiful &amp; interesting—I feel increasingly 
                tender towards all living creatures. My having been

                obliged to give up all idea of a separate life for myself beyond the grave, forces me more &amp; more to strive to
                do what little good I can in this world—convinces me more that (beyond our animal necessities) spiritual 
                life, that truth, that intercourse with the pure hearted amongst us here—is the only life really worth 
                living—I must not exclude the pure joys of nature—the <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible">[illegible]</span>, the mountain top, 
                and the forest.</p>
