                coarse nonsense. I must say that I only know Mr Dowden casually—a person of my world cannot aspire to 
                much acquaintance with a man whom I know to be so much in advance of me in every respect. My knowledge of 
                literature is very slight—I have not the critical insight into things that he has</p>

                obliged to give up all idea of a separate life for myself beyond the grave, forces me more &amp; more to strive to
                do what little good I can in this world—convinces me more that (beyond our animal necessities) spiritual 
                life, that truth, that intercourse with the pure hearted amongst us here—is the only life really worth

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
