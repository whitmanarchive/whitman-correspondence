                Well I must send you all dear fellows a word from my own 
                hand—propp'd up in bed, deadly weak yet but the 
                spark seems to glimmer yet—the doctors 
                &amp; nurses &amp; N Y friends as faithful as 
                ever—Here is the adv. 
                of the '92 edn. 
                Dr Bucke is well &amp; 
                hard at work—Col. Ingersoll 
                has been here, sent a basket of champagne. 
                All are good—physical conditions &amp;c. are 
                not so bad as you might suppose, 
                only my suffering[s] much of the time are 
                fearful—Again I repeat 
                my thanks to you &amp; cheery 
                British friends may be last—my right arm giving out—
            </p>

                    comes to the fore that the 
                    only theory worthy our modern times for 
                    g't literature, politics &amp; 
                    sociology must combine all the bulk people of all lands,

                    is stinging &amp; I must stop—Good bye 
                    to all—</p>
