                    22, 1871. The date August 22 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1871. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
                    with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:369). The year designated by
                    Bucke and affirmed by Miller is correct because it is consistent with a visit to
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman by Julia Hine after the death of her husband, Charles
                    Hine (also see Louisa's <a href="duk.00605">October 7, 1871</a> letter to

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    read at the opening of the American Institute, a long-running Brooklyn fair that
                    displayed flowers, plants, fruits, and products of American industry and
                    manufacture. The fair buildings, which occupied 100,000 square feet, were
                    located on the block enclosed by Second and Third Avenue and Sixty-third and
                    Sixty-fourth Street (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, September 14,
                    1871, 1). Whitman opened the American Institute on September 7, 1871, with a
                    recitation of "After All, Not to Create Only." The poem was widely reprinted
                    (see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/index.html">"Poems in Periodicals"</a> and Whitman's <a href="loc.01695">August

                    Invitations). The dates for Whitman's travel to Brooklyn, New York, and his

                    Charles Hine (1827–1871), indicated her intent to visit Walt Whitman's
                    mother in Brooklyn shortly after her husband's death (see Julia Hine's <a href="loc.01730">August 4, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman; for her name
                    Julia, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">United States Census, 1870</span>). Charles Hine was
                    a portrait and figure painter, and his painting of Walt Whitman became the
                    frontispiece for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1860. He died on July
                    31, 1871, only days after a visit from Whitman. Julia Hine may have visited
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in part because Walt had reported his mother
                    "ill—some of the time very ill" (see Walt Whitman's July 14, 1871 letter
