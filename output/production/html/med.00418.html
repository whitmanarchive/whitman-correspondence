        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still feeling on the gain to-day—I go out a little every day, 
        &amp; think I shall try to make a beginning at work in the office Monday or Tuesday—beginning by degrees—I got a letter from Jeff yesterday, very good—they seem to like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Buckley's—Jeff has some extra work, making plans 
        for new water works for Kansas City, Mo.—it is all the better—Mother, 
        I suppose you got the letters I wrote Monday &amp; Wednesday, this week—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">It was dark and rainy here yesterday, but is pleasant to-day—I am going out a little this afternoon—I send you some more papers, to-day—mother, do you get the papers I send. 
        Already you can see the grass looking green here, on the south side of buildings, 
        &amp; the willow trees are budding out slightly—Spring will soon be upon us—It is now noon, &amp; I am sitting here in the room—Mrs. O'Connor has come in, 
        first time in three days—Mammy dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sundays—Love to you and Georgie &amp; Lou &amp; all.
