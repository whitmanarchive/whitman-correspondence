      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still feeling on the gain to-day—I go out a little every day, 
        &amp; think I shall try to make a beginning at work in the office Monday or Tuesday—beginning by degrees—I got a letter from Jeff yesterday,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> very good—they seem to like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Buckley's—Jeff has some extra work, making plans 
        for new water works for Kansas City, Mo.—it is all the better—Mother, 
        I suppose you got the letters I wrote Monday &amp; Wednesday,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> this week—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">It was dark and rainy here yesterday, but is pleasant to-day—I am going out a little this afternoon—I send you some more papers, to-day—mother, do you get the papers I send. 
        Already you can see the grass looking green here, on the south side of buildings, 
        &amp; the willow trees are budding out slightly—Spring will soon be upon us—It is now noon, &amp; I am sitting here in the room—Mrs. O'Connor has come in, 
        first time in three days—Mammy dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sundays—Love to you and Georgie &amp; Lou &amp; all.

                    1873, to the missing letter of March 19, 1873, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    complained of her lot: "i have many little things to put up with but we all have
                    our annoyances, some one way and some another. george is good enough to me but
                    he thinks and its all right he should that every thing Lou does is all right. .
                    . . george is a good man but i dont think i ever saw any one so changed. he used to be so generous and
                    free but now he is very saving, never goes out any where. so we go walter dear"
