                    Sloane Kennedy, whose transcription, held in the Trent Collection of Whitmaniana
                    at Duke University, is the only available text, the letter was written on the
                    verso of one from Charles Eldridge to Whitman on April 14, 1887, discussing
                    William D. O'Connor's illness and his indignation over Thomas Wentworth
                    Higginson's articles in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Bazar</span>: "It is fortunate
                    for Higginson that I am sick." On March 5 Higginson wrote about the "proposed
                    pension for Mr. Whitman, the poet; although he is not wholly an instance in
                    point, having been a man of conspicuously fine physique, but who deliberately
                    preferred service in the hospitals rather than in the field." On March 26, in
                    "Women and Men. The Victory of the Weak," Higginson supported Lanier's attack
                    upon the "dandyism" in Whitman's depiction of the "roughs." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n4979">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4979 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4979"><span>Robert Pearsall Smith
                    (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
                    with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
                    often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
                    Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

                    attended the New York lecture (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of

                    Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
                    this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
                    over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
                    published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days and Collect</span> (1882–83). For more on

                    Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: New York University Press,

                    one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
