            <p class="tei_p">On almost every American mail-day I think of writing to you, but I have a bad habit of putting off things—as you know, &amp; 
                week after week slips by &amp; accuses my long silence. This remissness is very much of a part with the rest of my story of late. 
                I seem to have done nothing but vegetate, &amp; think of the fine fruition that there may be to come. However, it is good to 
                vegetate too at times.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Since writing last, I have moved still higher up Hampstead Heath, &amp; am now at the very top of everything, with fine old trees &amp; 
                gardens all around &amp; the northern part of the Heath leading on to a wide sweep of open country beyond, making a characteristic view
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03342.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03342.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03342.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
           of the English kind, quite unlike anything that I saw in America. As for the Heath itself, it has a comparative wildness for a place 
            so near London, &amp; makes a capital background for a holiday crowd such as comes up here on Easter Monday, when penny shows &amp; 
            all sorts of nonsense flourish amain.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Cold winds have rather kept back the spring in the last week or two, but now the trees are getting fairly green. Opposite my window 
                the birds kick up a great row in the branches, as they discuss the delicate question of mating &amp; nesting &amp; teaching the 
                youngsters the social proprieties. Happy little rascals, that have not to write—write—write, for a living.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By the way, have you seen Havelock Ellis's book,—"The New Spirit,"  in which you figure very notably? 
                No doubt the writer (who is a good friend of mine, &amp; an original fellow) has sent you a copy. If he has not, I must send you 
                one.—I'm afraid I must stop here to-day</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will write again soon—in time for your approaching birthday.</p>
