            <p class="tei_p">I am still laid up here quite sick<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—last week has
                been about the same as the previous one with me—I am up &amp; drest, but dont
                go out—the weather is in my favor here,—if it was as hot here as it seems
                to be most of the time in Philadelphia, it would go hard with me—They are as
                kind &amp; good as can be, both Dr and Mrs Bucke—then I have a horse &amp;
                little basket-wagon appropriated to me, to go out by myself, or be driven out just
                whenever I like—but to be deprest &amp; sick prevents any thing being
                enjoyed—But enough of this—I have no doubt it will pass over, as it has
                times before—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The country here is beautiful with hay &amp; wheat—they are just now in the
                height of harvest for both, &amp; I watch them from<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00482_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00482_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00482_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00482_large.jpg</span> my windows—We have rain every
                third or fourth day (just now a little too much)—Dr Bucke has a big house
                &amp; a great many visitors—from two or three to five or six here nearly all
                the time—two fine young ladies staying all the time, with Mrs B &amp; a
                governess for his younger children—I tell you if I felt well I should have
                great times—even as it is we have some jovial hours—last evening nothing
                would do but I had to come in the parlor &amp; sing a couple of verses of "Black
                Eye'd Susan"—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If I get all right, the plan is three of us, Doctor &amp; another man &amp; myself
                to go down the Lakes, and all down the St Lawrence, (the "Thousand Islands" &amp;c)
                and so on far north to a great river, the Saguenay, I have always wanted to
                see—&amp; so to Quebec—will take three weeks—but I will have to
                feel very different from what I do now—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well I must close—How are you all? Is George well this summer? Is Harry well
                &amp; in the store? This is about the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">eighth</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ninth</span> document I have sent to you from Canada—counting
                papers, letters, postal cards, &amp;c. (one to Harry from Lake Huron) &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">havn't​ </span></span> had a single breath of reply from any of you</span>—Susan I
                enclose you an envelope—Love to all—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I shall get well, no doubt, &amp; be coming back like a bad penny toward the end
                    of the summer.</p>

                    Whitman's illness in Whitman's Commonplace Book, but in a letter to William D.
                    O'Connor on <a href="duk.00535">July 1</a>, Bucke noted that Whitman "has
                    not been very well for a few days" (The Trent Collection of Walt Whitman
                    Manuscripts, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
                    Library). Though Whitman and O'Connor remained estranged until 1882, Bucke as
                    well as John Burroughs apparently kept O'Connor informed about the poet's
                    activities. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
