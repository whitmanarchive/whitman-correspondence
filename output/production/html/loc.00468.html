            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">When I wrote you yesterday I had not had time to read your last letter but when I went home and gave it to Mattie the thought that you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">might</span> yet come to see her made her feel very happy  It seems to be the one desire of her life to have you come and see her—she rested much better last night—her throat is better and her cough better but she has the most intense pain in her side and shoulder and arm—One side and breast is so swollen that it makes her quite one-sided and the pain most all the time is terrible severe—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What do you think about the trip? I am sure we can make you very comfortable here—and I believe you could come through without hardly knowing it—at the same time if George could he might come with you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You would not need to make any preparation for the journey—you would find a colored porter on the car that would bring you your meals—you could have the table put up in the section and eat as if you were at home—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If Mat was well enough I would come for you—but as it is I cannot leave her—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The children are very good and as well as can be—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will write again soon  write me and tell [me] what you think about coming</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Love to Loo and George</p>
