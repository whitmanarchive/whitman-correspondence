            </span>

            <p class="tei_p"> Your last letter to hand,—Disappointed not to hear a better account of your
                health yet, hoped that you were beginning to get around as usual, and like my
                mother, you are one who misses fresh air so.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Mother is very sadly, obliged to leave off writing (pro tem only
                I hope.)—a sort of nervous prostration and asthma which aggravated by
                sleeplessness w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">ch</span> has gone on for the last month and the
                struggle for breath is making her very weak. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I send you a letter from one Edward
                Pease of (Quaker stock) an admirer <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02183.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02183.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02183.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> &amp; active friend of yours over
                here in a quiet way. He is rendering some assistance
                over the "Tribute" etc: Perhaps you will write to him or Her about it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Alma Tadema the most celebrated artist over here has
                written to congratulate me over my last picture (finished this summer) and w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">ch</span> he saw at a friend's house. It is rather a feather in my
                cap—and will perhaps prove a turning point in my artistic career, who knows! </p> 
            <p class="tei_p"> I lead a quiet but moderately varied life and am able to enjoy my work and possess
                one or two friends. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Thanks for news about Staffords very glad to hear that they are all well. I had heard
                from M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span> Stafford that Ruthie had married; but how young!
                a long hard life I doubt me! </p>
