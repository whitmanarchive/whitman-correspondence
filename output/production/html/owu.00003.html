            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter and was right glad to get it<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I am in rather a writing mood
                today and have written a long letter to Han<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I also enclosed one from Jeff it was a
                very long and lively one and I thought it would please her. I am having very
                pleasant times here, sometimes, it is very gay, it it the style here when any one
                has company every one calls on them. tomorrow I have to return quite a number it is
                quite a bore to me to make fashionable calls but of course I must submit to it. but
                what I enjoy most of any thing else is sitting in my window looking down the Susquanhanna for miles and on the opposite side long ranges of the Alleganny Mountains they are mostly cultivated and their is something delightful
                about the scenery I would never tire looking at it we have not had what I call a
                real hot day <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00003.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fowu.00003.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00003.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">owu.00003.002.jpg</span> this
                summer the children are very happy and contented seldom talk about home they are
                very fat and burnt Hattie talks a good deal about seeing you, and says she is going
                out with Uncle Walt. I write to Mother quite often it seems to cheer her up to get
                letters, I tell her every little particular I have been to a number of picnics they are very pleasant. this week we expect to go to the
                Barclay coal mines<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> every one around here seems related some way to Mr or Mrs Mason
                we also go riding a good deal the time passes quickly and I am much pleased that I
                decided to come here I expect to leave for Washington with Mary &amp; Jule the 29th
                ins't Wont you come and
                 me Walt
                before you leave for Brooklyn<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I want to see you very much about those "Notes"<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> I would
                like much to have a copy but think it hardly worth while to send them here but you
                will save me a copy when I come to Washington I dont think of any more to write at
                present and it is getting late and I want yet to write one to Mother bidding you
                good night I remain your Affectionate sister</p>
