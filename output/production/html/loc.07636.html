            <p class="tei_p">I was out yesterday to my friends the Harneds, &amp; took a 3 or 4 mile drive
                afterward at sunset. The weather is pleasent—seems settled—I still write
                bits for the H[erald]—Haywood the Mass: free lover here to-day, very cordial &amp;c. I
                treat him politely but that is all.  I rec'd yrs: with L[ippincott]'s
                declination—Eakin[s] has taken away his picture &amp; I havn't seen him for
                ten days</p>
