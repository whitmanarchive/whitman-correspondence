                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                        <a href="loc.03570">September 9, 1884</a>, he was in Ireland.
                    Acknowledging his failure to persuade a German publisher to undertake the
                    volume, he now wanted Whitman to find "a willing publisher with some German
                    connection" in America. The book was printed in 1889 in Switzerland. This draft
                    letter was written on the verso of an envelope from John K. Randall, a Baltimore
                    lawyer. According to Whitman's reference to this letter in his Commonplace Book,
                    he must have sent about this time a post card to Rolleston in
                    Switzerland. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
