            <p class="tei_p">How I wish that you were here just now!—The day perfect,—clear air, warm
                sunshine, with just felt breezes—the beautiful, park-like grounds—&amp;
                the homely hospitality of your old friend,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a> &amp; of his wife and family.—If

                instantly waft you here.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enjoyed the journey here immensely. The novelty of the luxurious Sleeping Car

                10 oclock, &amp; both enjoyed a refreshing night's sleep. Morning clear &amp; fresh
                &amp; beautiful—the landscape &amp; farmsteads American!—Stopped for an
                hour &amp; a quarter at Buffalo, where we had breakfast. Arrived at Niagara Falls
                (Canadian side) about 11.15 &amp; had to wait for a train @ 3.—So, after the
                Custom House officers had examined our Baggage we took a conveyance to the Falls.
                Took long looks at them from several points of view, silently absorbing. Sun shining
                gloriously, blue sky with light clouds here &amp; there. I won't attempt to convey
                my impressions of the Falls. Only that I was quite unprepared for their delicate
                &amp; exquisite beauty. The effects of the wreathing spray were beyond description
                &amp; unique. In coming to America I was indifferent whether I saw Niagara or not.

                at the Depot, &amp; then put in the time till train came in—Dr.<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">3</a> reading, I scribbling. Then a 4 hours run to
                London—country beautiful all the time—"Blue Ontario"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> like a sapphire on our right for a time—snake
                fences, stumps of trees, homesteads, character of scenery, perfect loveliness of

                there, &amp; exchanging greetings. Everyone manifestly glad to see him
                back—talk &amp; laughter, band playing all the time—now "Home, Sweet

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
