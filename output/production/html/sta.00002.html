            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter has reached me—my best thanks for your contribution to the wounded &amp; sick, &amp; shall be applied in most needy cases. You speak of seeing Dr. Russell<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—has he not rec'd a N. Y. Times of two months since containing a sketch of my Visits to Hospitals<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—I thought one had been sent him. If he has not had one I should like to send one to him. The paragraph in the Gazette by Mr Shillaber is very kind. I do not wish you to send me any of the papers. Nothing new or special with me—I believe I told you I was working a few hours a day, a sufficiently remunerative desk in Indian office—I spend a couple of hours day or evening in the hospitals. Farewell.</p>

                        30, 1864</a>, O'Connor had informed Whitman that he had read this letter
                    "with a swelling heart and wet eyes. It was very great and touching to me. I
                    think I could mount the tribune for you on that and speak [a] speech which jets
                    fire and drops tears. Only it filled me with infinite regrets that there is not
                    a book from you, embodying these rich and sad experiences. It would be sure of
                    immortality. No history of our times would ever be written without it." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
