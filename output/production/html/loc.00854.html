                    signed a contract with Peter Eckler to stereotype 500 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> for $254.00: "The workmanship is to be
                    first class in every respect &amp; to be completed, &amp; the printed sheets
                    delivered within one month from this date." The contract called for "one hundred
                    &amp; twenty pages," but since the book contained only 72 pages, Eckler
                    submitted on April 12 a bill for $192.85, of which $138.00 had been
                    paid. According to Whitman's notations on the statement, he paid $20.00 on
                    April 26 and again on <a href="rut.00002">May 2</a>. Whitman sent another
                    letter on <a href="loc.00841">May 3</a> in answer to Eckler's request of
                    May 1 that the balance be paid. On <a href="loc.00855">May 4</a>, Eckler
                    issued a receipt for $34.85, and included a receipt from Coridon A. Alvord,
                    printer, for the stereotype plates, which he had placed in his vault. On <a href="loc.00880">April 26</a>, Eckler had informed Whitman that the book
                    was "now to press" and would "be ready for the Binders next Monday morning."
