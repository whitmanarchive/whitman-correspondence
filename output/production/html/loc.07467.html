                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
                    1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
                    Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
                    Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
                    more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
