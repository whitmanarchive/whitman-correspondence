            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Last night was my first real attempt at the kind of splurge we have talked about.
                Bust &amp; photo exhibition; clay modeling and talk. I came off at the Presbyterian
                Ch. before the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tuesday</span> Club—I have met nowhere a
                more intelligent company. There were some 200 present. I began by a ten minute
                reading as a sort of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"prayer"</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prelude,</span> &amp; then turned to my clay &amp; modeled &amp; talked for a
                half or three quarters of an hour, producing a tolerably good head of old John
                    Brown.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03181.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03181.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03181.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I was able to
                keep up a continuous interest. Then I explained casting in plaster, &amp; the
                reproduction in marble. Then I drew some chalk pictures on blackboard, &amp; gave
                some reminiscinces of Emerson, yourself &amp; Dr. Holmes. I had your photos there—&amp; many others, with my busts
                of Hicks, Sumner, Emerson, &amp; my little
                head of mother—We kept up the business till near ten o'clock. I guess it was a
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">success.</span> At all events, the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">thanks</span> were profuse and hearty. Several ministers were there &amp; in
                perfectly <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03181.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03181.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03181.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> good
                humor. I now feel sure I can make this sort of thing <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span>
                over the country. But I want to reduce the bust exhibition business to a magic
                lantern performance. It will not be so picturesque, but more convenient, &amp; much
                less expensive. It would cost like sin to tote several large busts about the
                country. I wish I had photos of my big busts of you &amp; of the statuette,
                negatives small size fit for stereopticon. I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> have
                them some way. Next Sunday's Register will print my opening remarks &amp; give a
                account of the evening <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03181.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03181.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03181.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I shall send you a copy.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am worried about Harned. Horace
                just wrote me a word &amp; sent the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Posts</span> two weeks ago,
                &amp; that's all I've heard. I hope the affair has not been serious.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And I hope you are comfortable. I should like to stop in &amp; see you all. I'm
                trying to get the Hicks bust plastered before sending. Will send it by 1st of next
                week. I rather wanted to make the most of it here, &amp; so have delayed. What about
                the lecture for the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Fidelity</span>?</p>
