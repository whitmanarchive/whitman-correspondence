Tucker was a
                    translator, editor, and friend of writer John Ruskin. On <a href="loc.04270">May 25, 1882</a>, Tucker offered to act as Whitman's publisher in order
                    to test the Boston banning of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.51.html">Monday, September 3, 1888</a>, 253–254). As editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberty</span>, he followed the Boston controversy closely in
                    editorial comments on May 27, June 10, and July 22. In the July issue, he
                    printed an advertisement in which he offered to sell and mail <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> to any purchaser, and informed Stevens, Marston,
                    Tobey, and Comstock, all of whom were mentioned by name, that he was willing to
                    have his offer tested in the courts. On August 19, he commented: "We have
                    offered to meet the enemy, but the enemy declines to be met. . . . We still
                    advertise the book for sale, and sell it openly and rapidly." The advertisement
                    appeared again on September 16. For more information on the controversy, see

                    translation. On October 14, Whitman sent Knortz's
                    translations to Rolleston, and on December 10 noted receipt of his friend's
                    "lecture pamphlet, 'Wordsworth and Walt Whitman' from Dresden [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Über Wordsworth und Walt Whitman</span>]" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).

                    on February 13, 1884. Whitman's corrections in purple crayon appear in Traubel's
