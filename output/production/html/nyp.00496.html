            <p class="tei_p">Have finished my Germantown visit &amp; am back here. I did not send Dr B[ucke]'s
                book to Mrs. Ritter—have indeed not sent copies to
                any except my sisters and <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="nieces​ ">neices</span>​ . Mrs. Gilchrist, however, has a
                copy—John Burroughs also has—Glad you sent one to Tucker—he is a good friend—I have not heard any
                thing more of Rolleston's German translation. Dr Karl
                Knortz, cor: Morris av. &amp; 155th st. New York City, has translated many of my
                poems in German, &amp; published them. Do you know the
