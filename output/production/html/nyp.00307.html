      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I suppose you got a letter from me telling you that I had been down stairs 
        &amp; out on Monday—it was more exertion than I could bear, and I have not been so well since. 
        I got two letters from Jeff to-day, the last one dated the 16th—Matt had rested well the night before—
        poor, poor Mat, I am ready to hear to her departure any day—it seems terrible—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Things are going on as well as could be expected with me, but slowly—
        I overdid the matter day before yesterday, and am now waiting—
        I am sitting up by the stove alone writing this. Love [to] you, dearest Mother, and to all—
      </p>
