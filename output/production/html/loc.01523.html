                outside, &amp; cold &amp; wintry as ever—there has not been one mild day here
                for the past three weeks—two thirds of the time spiteful and gusty
                wind &amp; clouds of dust—&amp; this with bitter cold—seems to me I have
                felt the cold more than for the last three winters—But I reckon I have said
                enough on this point—Pete I cannot write anything interesting to you <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01523.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01523.002_large.jpg</span>as I do not go

                job—I am home every night (&amp; half the days also)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tuesday noon</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am afraid this letter is not destined to be very cheering—I was attacked last

                inky black, &amp; all of a sudden snow fell so thick &amp; fast, it was like a dense
                fog,—so thick the hard wind didn't dissipate it in the least—This lasted
                about half an hour, &amp; was about the highest old weather exhibition I ever
                witnessed—snow fell two inches thick in 15 minutes</p>

                <p class="tei_p">A Tremendous Blow.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">2</a></p>
                    <p class="tei_p">A few minutes before 6 o'clock last night, as many
                        were flocking to the ferries on their way home from business, a boisterous
                        southwest wind sprang up, which, veering round toward the north, developed into
                        a hurricane. In a few seconds the sky was hidden by dark clouds, from which a
                        heavy snow fell, and was driven along furiously before the gale. The suddenness
                        and the fury of the storm created the greatest excitement around the ferries,
                        and the fog bells were at once set in motion, but even these only added to the
                        bewilderment, as the wind was so strong and uncertain. The James Rumsey ferry
                        boat, from Hoboken at 5:50 P.M., met the full force of the storm, through which
                        it was steered by means of the compass, and succeeded after the second attempt
                        in entering its slip at Barclay street, having done the trip in twenty-two
                        minutes. The Jersey City and Desbrosses street boat was safely steered through
                        the storm by the compass. Several of the boats waited in their slips fifteen or
                        twenty minutes for the storm to abate. Toward 7 o'clock the snow ceased to fall,
                        and the clouds gradually disappeared, but the wind continued boisterous
                        throughout the night.</p>

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
