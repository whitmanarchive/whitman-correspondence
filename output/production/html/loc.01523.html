            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here in my room home, alone—it is snowing hard &amp; heavy
                outside, &amp; cold &amp; wintry as ever—there has not been one mild day here
                for the past three weeks—two thirds of the time spiteful and gusty
                wind &amp; clouds of dust—&amp; this with bitter cold—seems to me I have
                felt the cold more than for the last three winters—But I reckon I have said
                enough on this point—Pete I cannot write anything interesting to you <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01523.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>as I do not go
                anywhere, nor see anything new.—I have attended to the bringing out the new
                edition of my book, but as the plates were all ready before, it is not much of a
                job—I am home every night (&amp; half the days also)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tuesday noon</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am afraid this letter is not destined to be very cheering—I was attacked last
                night with sore throat, pretty bad—still I made out this morning to worry down
                a fair breakfast—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01523.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>The weather has been so infernal—last evening toward sundown, begun
                the spitefulest wind &amp; cold I ever knew,—great clouds suddenly come up,
                inky black, &amp; all of a sudden snow fell so thick &amp; fast, it was like a dense
                fog,—so thick the hard wind didn't dissipate it in the least—This lasted
                about half an hour, &amp; was about the highest old weather exhibition I ever
                witnessed—snow fell two inches thick in 15 minutes</p>
            
 
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Pete, how are you getting along—how about Sailer and
                the RR?—I suppose slow &amp; aggravating enough—by what you said in
                your last. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01523.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01523.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>Dear Pete, I don't think I shall stay here as long as I originally
                intended—I shall be back by or before the end of this month—I am
                writing these lines home in the Kitchen—mother is sitting in the rocking chair
                sewing something—&amp; Eddy is grinding some good coffee in a coffee
                mill—it smells good—(I have retreated to the Kitchen, for the hot
                fire—here now I am not like I am in Washington—you would laugh to see
                me hovering over the fire)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—My darling son, you must keep a good heart—dont get discouraged—love to
                you, baby,—I enclose $10—&amp; can send you whatever you want—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">A Tremendous Blow.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">A few minutes before 6 o'clock last night, as many
                        were flocking to the ferries on their way home from business, a boisterous
                        southwest wind sprang up, which, veering round toward the north, developed into
                        a hurricane. In a few seconds the sky was hidden by dark clouds, from which a
                        heavy snow fell, and was driven along furiously before the gale. The suddenness
                        and the fury of the storm created the greatest excitement around the ferries,
                        and the fog bells were at once set in motion, but even these only added to the
                        bewilderment, as the wind was so strong and uncertain. The James Rumsey ferry
                        boat, from Hoboken at 5:50 P.M., met the full force of the storm, through which
                        it was steered by means of the compass, and succeeded after the second attempt
                        in entering its slip at Barclay street, having done the trip in twenty-two
                        minutes. The Jersey City and Desbrosses street boat was safely steered through
                        the storm by the compass. Several of the boats waited in their slips fifteen or
                        twenty minutes for the storm to abate. Toward 7 o'clock the snow ceased to fall,
                        and the clouds gradually disappeared, but the wind continued boisterous
                        throughout the night.</p>
