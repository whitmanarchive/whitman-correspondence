                indifferent sleighing and today the sun is out bright and warm and the snow is going
                again as fast as it can. [—] Your good, heartily welcomed letter of 19<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> &amp; 20<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> came to hand this forenoon, by the same mail came also
                your bundle of "Critic" and "Press" also a bundle from
                    Horace; San Francisco "Bulletin" &amp; "Poet Lore [.]" Many thanks to you and him for
                    all. Also just arrived from Brentano Bros "The
                Century Guild Hobby Horse" with a lovely little 2 page piece on "November Boughs" by
                Selwyn Image. So you see 'tout va bien" with my
                collection which bids fair to be one day the envy of millionaires. The "Springfield
                Rep.," I should say, came in Horaces bundle and I like
                    Sanborns criticism
                well—better than the critic piece which (to me) has a smack of unrealness,
                want of sincerity (but perhaps I do the writer injustice). [—] Yes, dear Walt, you must be tired, horribly
                tired, of that room of yours—I really think that when the warm spring days
                come you must move downstairs and by means of some contrivance get into a suitable
                carriage and have a look again at the grass and trees—if you are not worse
                than at present if can be done and ought to be done, and if any thing will revive
                you that will.—Yes I shall be right glad to see the big book in its permanent cover and shall depend on you for as early a
                copy as possible. Nothing more definite about trip East, still hope to get off 4
