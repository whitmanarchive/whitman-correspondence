                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as
                    "Good-Bye my Fancy" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    (1891–1892), the last edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    published before Whitman's death in March 1892. For more information see, Donald

                    (1855–1928) was a lawyer's clerk and a member of the "Bolton College" of
                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February
