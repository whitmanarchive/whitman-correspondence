                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Harry Buxton Forman, was most notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley
                    and John Keats. On <a href="loc.01619">February 21, 1872</a>, Buxton sent

                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
                        of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</span>, which exposed Forman as a
