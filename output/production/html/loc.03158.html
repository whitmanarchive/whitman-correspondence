            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> This is a fine Xmas morning—cold &amp; clear—the air full of church
                bells chiming. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> You should see my old mother—<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">spry</span> today, gets about without a stick, not bowed, nor over
                much wrinkled; full of fun and clear headed &amp; able to direct the turkey-stuffing
                and suet-pudding making as well as ever. She has kept her mentality (as the
                spiritists used to say) as sound &amp; bright as ever it was. And her memory is
                remarkable. She calls up the forgotten past and tells us all of our deeds &amp;
                misdeeds. You bet she was awfully tickled to see me—I found them all <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03158.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03158.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03158.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03158.002_large.jpg</span> abed, &amp; had

                all came down, my brothers, sister, &amp; the three children, &amp; didn't get back
                to bed again till past one o clock. They also have a capacious tea pot, &amp; it was
                well filled. I gave mother your compliments &amp; she sends her kindest to you,
                &amp; hopes you will take a <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_medium">start</span> someday as she did &amp; walk without cane. She was delighted
                with the cake the Harned's sent, &amp; with Mrs Davis'<a href="#n6113" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6113">2</a>
                silk kerchief. She said the "angel food was sadly needed" in her family. And then
                you should hear her laugh. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03158.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03158.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03158.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03158.003_large.jpg</span> She said she used to say when she was a girl, she hoped she

                her alive. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I find my brother a very democratic individual—rather opinionated &amp; too
                "damn sure" to get on easy with; but he allows two black fellows to sleep in his
                shop &amp; ekes out their scanty subsistence with a cup of coffee &amp; a "bite,"
                &amp; at Christmas dinner he had up an old lady who lives alone, a sort of
                counterpart to Aunt Mary. She thought she must do something, so she brought up a
                "poor man's pudding" <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03158.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03158.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03158.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03158.004_large.jpg</span> and we had the toughest job to get away with it, so as not to
                disturb her. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am in the midst of the confusion—all the family around &amp; talking, &amp;
                the cold weather—I wonder if it's so in Camden. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I just write this <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">memoranda</span> to let you know the situation.
                Perhaps Mrs Davis will care to read it, &amp; accept the old lady's proud thanks.
                The first my brother said when I showed him the Hicks picture<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> was—"He's the man who said the blood of Christ has
                no more to do with our sins" &amp;c. He thinks it a grand head. </p>
