            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing very new &amp; I suppose George has written to you, as he returned
                about 6 p m yesterday all right—but I thought I would drop a line<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Of course the shooting of President Garfield<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is the
                general subject, &amp; has depressed me much, but for the last twenty four hours,
                his case is so much more favorable—We had the most horrible <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">celebration</span> here I ever knew, commenced at dark Sunday night, continued
                all night &amp; of course next day, ruffians yelling, crackers, and all the old guns
                &amp; pistols of all Jersey, with all the bad elements of humanity completely let
                loose &amp; making the most infernal din possible to conceive for over thirty hours
                without a moments intermission—Over in Philadelphia perfectly quiet, (all the
                bad stuff probably came over here)—very hot indeed here the last four days,
                &amp; continues still—I am standing it well—I take my meals at Mrs
                    Wroth's<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> &amp; find it a very good place—it was
                a good move, my going there—Mrs W is very kind—Tip has been all right
                &amp; has had his meals regular—a little off his feed &amp; off <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his bark</span> this morning, I suppose from the great heat, &amp;
                folks away—Arthur Stanley lives now over at the Chevaliers, with his new
                    wife<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—his little boy <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="brought​ ">bro't</span>​  me over a nice piece of wedding cake Sunday which I took down to Alice
                    Wroth<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">house</span> is all right so far—I try to keep as cool as
                I can—what with bathing &amp; ventilation, &amp; of course you will find some
                litter when you come back—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send some <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ledgers</span>—I am writing this in the dining
                room, by open window—George was writing early forenoon, but has gone
                out—Tip has commenced a good barking at last (11½ oclock) after being
                quiet all the forenoon—I was afraid something was the matter with
                him—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am busy five or six hours yet every day with the copy of my book—hard work to
                get it in the shape I want it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I finish it is after noon &amp; very hot &amp; oppressive—Love to you &amp;
                all—tell little Amy<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> I have not forgotten her,
                &amp; that I am going to give Tip a nice sweet coffee-cake for his
                dinner—George has just returned—</p>
