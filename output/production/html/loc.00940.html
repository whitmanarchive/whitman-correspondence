                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
                    1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
                    Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
                    Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
                    more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
                    (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
                    partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
                    covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
                    powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York, Rowman
                    and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
                    translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
                    O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on <a href="med.00324">August 13,
                        1864</a>, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
                    attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
                    pistol."
                    Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
                    phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
                    (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
                    I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
                    trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
                    Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first category of his threefold
                    evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and
                    "Blame." In his entry for April 18, 1864, the Count referred to Whitman as among
                    "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote
                    (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had
                    "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that
                    would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised

                    way to visit his brother George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in
                    Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk in the
                    office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George had not
                    been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his home until
                    1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood,
                    the army paymaster. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00940_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00940_n4"><span>John J. Piatt met Whitman

                    is unclear. A Mrs. Cooper is mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's

                    Eldridge was going to stay at Mrs. Cooper's home in Philadelphia for several
                    days. This is undoubtedly the Hattie B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H.
                    B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting"
                    to Whitman. Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a different Mrs. Cooper on

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for

                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
