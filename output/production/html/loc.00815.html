            <p class="tei_p">I have just this moment received your letter dated last Monday evening—dear mother, I have not seen any thing in any paper where the 51st is, nor heard any thing, but I do not feel any ways uneasy about them, I presume they are at Knoxville, Tennessee<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—Mother, they are now paying off many of the regiments in this army—but about George I suppose there will be delays in sending money &amp;c—dear mother, I wish I had some money to send you, but I am living very close by the wind—Mother, I will try somehow to send you something worth while, &amp; I do hope you will not worry &amp; feel unhappy about money matters—I know things are very high—Mother, I suppose you got my letter written Tuesday last, 29th March, did you not?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been going to write to Jeff for more than a month—I laid out to write a good long letter, but something has prevented me, one thing &amp; another—but I will try to write to-morrow sure—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I have been in the midst of suffering &amp; death for two months worse than ever—the only comfort is that I have been the cause of some beams of sunshine upon their suffering &amp; gloomy souls &amp; bodies too—many of the dying I have been with too—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, you must not worry about the grocery bill &amp;c, though I suppose you will say that is easier said than followed—(As to me I believe I worry about worldly things less than ever, if that is possible)—Tell Jeff &amp; Mat I send them my love—Gen Grant has just come in town from front—the country here is all mud again—I am going to a spiritualist medium<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> this evening, I expect it will be a humbug of course, I will tell you next letter—dear mother, keep a good heart—</p>

                    mother, George traced the itinerary of the Fifty-first Regiment: "When I last
                    wrote you [March 6] from Nashville Tenn. we were just about leaving that place
                    for the front. Well we went to Knoxville by way of Chattanooga, stopped at
                    Knoxville a day or two, and then were ordered to a place called Mossy Creek,
                    about 40 miles beyond Knoxville. The next day after we arrived at the Creek we
                    were ordered to bout face and travel over the same ground again back to this
                    place. We arrived here yesterday having been nearly two weeks on the journey,
                    our Regt. came nearly all the way by Rail Road."
