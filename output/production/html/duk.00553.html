            <p class="tei_p">i
                got
            both of your letters one
            the last of last week
            and the other on monday                
            i got one from Heyde
            yesterday tuesday) saying
            hannah was improving
            but had a bad thumb
            but no fever i think its
            pretty hard to tell how
            she is by his letters but
            i think she must be
            quite smart he said
            she had the girl that
            they had when i was
            there


            she was very good
            and thought very much
            of han and will doo

            very well for her
            i make no doubt)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">well walter dear
            we are getting along
            quite smart matty
            is improving but far
            from well the doctor
            is doctoring her throat
            with great sucsess
            i think he has performed
            two moderate opperations
            on her throat) but O dear
            if you could hear her
            talk it would make
            me hoarse to talk a
            steady stream as she
            does when any one
            comes in to see her
            i dread to see any
            one come in i talk

            and talk to her but
            it does no manner
            of good she gets
            almost offended at
            me Perbasco was
            here the other evening
            and staid quite late                
                and the way mats
                toung went it certainly
            would have made
            me have had the
            headach to have
            talked such a length
            of time steady
            but so
            it is she went out the
            other day i said dont
            go to any place but
            i knew in reason she
            would so she went
            to saywards and
            stayed till dark
