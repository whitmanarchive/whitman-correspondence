                        November 11, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman did not provide any form of a
                        date for the letter, but the letter does refer to the day before as Tuesday.
                        Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter November 11, 1868, a Wednesday, and
                        Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                        1961–77], 2:70–71, n. 31; 2:366). The date November, 11, 1868,
                        accords with a recent throat operation for Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman
                        in Brooklyn, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's statement about an
                        architectural drawing that George Washington Whitman has received raises
                        some doubt about the date.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">After Mattie's arrival in Brooklyn to visit a physician in October, Walt
                        reported to his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman that the physician
                        hoped to have a better sense of Mattie's health within "ten or twelve days"
                        after a surgery (see his <a href="mhs.00027">October 25, 1868</a>
                        letter to Jeff). Louisa's <a href="duk.00554">November 4?, 1868</a>
                        letter to Walt must date after Walt's letter and before this letter both
                        because Mattie's surgery remained in the future in that letter and because
                        George went to Camden "last night" and is expected to stay there through
                        November 21. Mattie's throat surgery was performed, presumably, shortly
                        after Louisa's November 4 letter to Walt, and this letter dates November 11,
                        the Wednesday after Mattie's surgery. However, the letter also states that
                        George "has got a draw of the two houses they talk of building." If the
                        statement implies that George has returned to Brooklyn, it contradicts his
                        plan to be away at Camden for over two weeks. However, Louisa explained in
                        her <a href="duk.00554">November 4, 1868</a> letter to Walt that
                        George was inclined to return more often than every two weeks (that amount
                        of time is required for return trip to be paid by the Brooklyn Water Board),
                        because he is "carried away by somebody." According to Louisa's <a href="duk.00552">November 10, 1868</a> letter, George "is away."
                        Even if George was not then in Brooklyn, his receipt of an architectural
                        drawing could have alternate explanations: he may have received the drawing
                        in Camden, which Louisa forwarded or received on his behalf, or he returned
                        briefly to Brooklyn and was again away. The matter of George's architectural
                        drawing can only be resolved by a surmise about what was probable.
                        Regardless, this letter cannot date to the Wednesday after November 11
                        because Jeff Whitman's arrival in Brooklyn was not expected until the
                        following week (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00555">November 18, 1868</a>
                        letter to Walt). Despite the doubts raised by George's drawings, this letter
                        must nonetheless date to the Wednesday between Louisa's November 4 and her
                        November 18 letters to Walt.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
                    care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
                    financial support from Walt Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n12">10. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00553_n12 note" id="duk.00553_n12"><span>It is not clear whether
                    this word is "off," superimposed over a word that began with the letter "g" or a
                    canceled word. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman may have begun to write the name
                    "george" but decided instead to continue the previous phrase that described
                    Edward: he is "very bad) off." The reading then is a letter "o" in "off" over a
                    partially canceled "g" in "george" but with the vertical mark after "bad"
                    uncanceled. Or Louisa may have intended to cancel the entire word but neglected
                    to cancel the second "f." </span></span> [<a href="#r12">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">11. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00425_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
