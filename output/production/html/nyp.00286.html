            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you received my letter of September 25.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> The letters to me from A. G. office, 
                (I suppose sent by you,) have probably all come right. I have received some 
                five or six. Please continue to send them the same way. If the envelopes run out, 
                please prepare some more, same form. When you write, tell me what news in the 
                A. G. office. Is Ashton<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> well? Is he running the office? Say to him 
                I sent my love—&amp; that, here north, as it seems to me, the Grant 
                &amp; Colfax tide is rising higher &amp; higher every day.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Did you see John Swinton's warm ¶ about my illustrious self in

                &amp; show him this note to read. J. B., dear friend, I wish I could have you here, 
                if only just to take a ride with me for once up &amp; down Broadway, on top a stage, of a fine afternoon.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>

                missed an appointment with him at Fifth Av. Hotel, when he passed through New York.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">William, I shall send Freiligrath a small package, containing a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">L. of G.</span>

                in a couple of days from here, by the European Express. I wish, if you feel 
                like it, you would prepare a letter to F. F. to go by mail—following the package.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>

            <p class="tei_p">Nelly, my dear friend, I send you my best love—in which my mother joins me—We are all well. Half my leave has already expired—&amp; the other half will be soon over.

Hubley Ashton, the
                    assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Walt Whitman's
                    affairs, and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan
                    fracas. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00286_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00286_n4"><span>In the draft letter after
                    this sentence appeared the following: "John seems lately possest with L. of G. as with a demon. I have found two or three
                    others—a Mr. Norton, of Boston, is one. He is an educated man, a Boston
                    metaphysical thinker." Walt Whitman also interpolated in the draft: "Tell
                    Charles Eldridge." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00286_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00286_n5"><span>The draft letter ends at
                    this point. However, above the salutation appeared the following: "ask about the
                    office—Ashton—has Andy Kerr returned —my new desk." Kerr, a
                    clerk in Walt Whitman's office, probably had gone to Pittsburgh; see address
                    book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #108). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00286_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00286_n6"><span>For Freiligrath, see Walt
                    Whitman's letters of <a href="nyp.00285">September 27, 1868</a> to the
                    O'Connors and of <a href="nyp.00284">January 26, 1869</a>. Again, as with
                    William Michael Rossetti (in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00277">January
                        1868</a> letter), O'Connor was to act as Whitman's emissary. On December
                    2, 1868, in a letter to his daughter, Freiligrath joyfully noted receipt of a
                    thirty-two page letter from O'Connor as well as the books Whitman mentioned in
                    this letter: "Der Schreiber ist natürlich ein enthusiastischer Verehrer des
                    sonderbaren Kauzes" (Ferdinand Freiligrath, Ida Melos Freiligrath, and Luise
                    Freiligrath Wiens, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Freiligrath-Briefe</span> [Stuttgart: J.G.
                    Cotta'sche Buchhandlung Nachfolger, 1910], 167–168). According to one of
                    Walt Whitman's address books (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman,
                    The Library of Congress, Notebook #109), the package was sent to Freiligrath on
                    November 11, 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
