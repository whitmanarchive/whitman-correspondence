            <p class="tei_p">I am afraid you will think my promise to write to you was not sincere but I have had
                very little time to myself for letter writing but now that I have set about to
                redeem my word I hope it will be welcome and receive a speedy reply from you. To
                begin at the beginning of my visit I spent nearly three weeks in New York with Mr.
                &amp; Mrs. Northen and of course<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00030.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fowu.00030.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00030.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> had a splendid opportunity of going
                about and seeing all I wanted in New York. I was quite fortunate with regard to the
                weather as I believe we only had two real stormy days while I was there. One thing I
                enjoyed about as much as any was the exhibition of pictures out at the Museum in the
                Park. Miss Woolf's collection, the very rich lady who died a
                year or so ago, was there also a large number of others including the one given by
                Vanderbilt called "The Horse Fair." I believe<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00030.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fowu.00030.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00030.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> looking at beautiful pictures and
                hearing good music are my chief pleasures with of course reading added the last a
                thing one could hardly exist without.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went over to Brooklyn to call on Jo. Barkelor. You of course
                remember her, she was so fond Grandma and is one of your ardent
                admirers. I did enjoy seeing her so much as I was unfortunate to miss her when I
                called last July as she had sailed for Europe the day before.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">She is a very lovely and smart<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00030.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fowu.00030.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00030.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> woman. Well to proceed with my trip I left New York on the
                twentieth of February for Hartford and have enjoyed my visit so far very much. These
                friends were new last fall but I almost feel as if I had known them always,
                particularly one from Ireland who is on a visit to America for
                the first time. Next Saturday I go to another friend's house
                for a couple of weeks which will about end my traveling about and turn my face once
                more towards Burlington. </p>
