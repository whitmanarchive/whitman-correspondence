            <p class="tei_p">I am afraid you will think my promise to write to you was not sincere but I have had
                very little time to myself for letter writing but now that I have set about to
                redeem my word I hope it will be welcome and receive a speedy reply from you. To
                begin at the beginning of my visit I spent nearly three weeks in New York with Mr.

                about and seeing all I wanted in New York. I was quite fortunate with regard to the
                weather as I believe we only had two real stormy days while I was there. One thing I
                enjoyed about as much as any was the exhibition of pictures out at the Museum in the
                Park. Miss Woolf's<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">2</a> collection, the very rich lady who died a

            <p class="tei_p">I went over to Brooklyn to call on Jo. Barkelor.<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">4</a> You of course

                admirers. I did enjoy seeing her so much as I was unfortunate to miss her when I
                called last July as she had sailed for Europe the day before.</p>

Well to proceed with my trip I left New York on the
                twentieth of February for Hartford and have enjoyed my visit so far very much. These
                friends were new last fall but I almost feel as if I had known them always,
                particularly one from Ireland who is on a visit to America for
                the first time. Next Saturday I go to another friend's house
                for a couple of weeks which will about end my traveling about and turn my face once
                more towards Burlington. </p>
