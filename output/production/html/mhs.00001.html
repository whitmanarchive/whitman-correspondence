            <p class="tei_p">I got home from Ark yesterday, after a pretty hard time—I had to abandon my Texas trip for the reason that I had some bids here to be opened on Monday  I did not get here till Wednesday—but that was owing to the weather and the Rail Roads  I shall go out to the cemetery on Sunday and leave Sunday night for Texas. I suppose I shall be gone about a week  Mr Smith<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> of Leavenworth was at my office on Monday last and came for the express purpose of carrying me off to New York all expenses paid—but of course I could not go—much as I wanted to—No I must make the best of what is wanted now—I presume I shall have lots of time after awhile—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well my dear girl I wish you would go and do just what gives you the most fun—and I do hope you will make fast friends of the New York and Hartford people—they are good folk to know</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall write Horace<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> that you are at Worthens<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> after the 1st for ten days—I think he will call and ask you to go to his place—and if he does I would like to have you go</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new with me—I am feeling fairly well—except I have my old terrible cough—it is pulling me down some—but I shall get out all right when the spring comes</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Wish you would go and see Walt as often as you can</p>
