                It stirs my heart to its depths to feel—as I have had reason

                Last Wednesday &amp; Thursday. Johnston &amp; 
                I were "on pins" all the time, expecting a telegram from Queenstown.
                This, however, D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B. had no opportunity of sending.
                On Friday mg. Johnston rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> a telegram from him
                saying he had arrived in Liverpool (11.45 Thursday night) &amp; would be 
                in Bolton at 11 oclock on Friday mg. Johnston &amp; I met him, recognising
                him immediately. We drove at once to Johnston's, discussing arrangements
                for the afternoon as we proceeded. It was settled that D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B. should drive

                his professional rounds, &amp; meet me in town for dinner. In the meantime
                I was to arrange for a drive in the afternoon &amp; beat up as many friends
                as I could to accompany us. Seven of us met in all—Fred Wild,
                Dixon, Shorrock, Hutton, 
                Johnston, D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B &amp; self. It was a glorious
                afternoon, bright, hot &amp; slightly misty. We took what we consider
                the best &amp; most interesting drive in the district—in the hilly
                moorland country north of the town, (all <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">flat</span>
                country south of Bolton) stopping eventually at the parsonage in Rivington,
                where Rev<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> S. Thompson gave us our tea.
                D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B had had no sleep during the two

                previous nights, &amp; was almost overpowered by his want of sleep &amp; by the heat.
                But he seemed to enjoy the drive. Thompson's quaint old fashioned garden
                interested him too, &amp; his quiet, simple, genuine hospitality. (Grown up son 
                &amp; daughter at home, M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Thompson away on a visit). 
                Johnston had <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_me tei_unclear_cert_high">brought</span> his camera, so took the opportunity, while we were in the garden
                to photograph the group, and D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Bucke alone.
                Then the drive to Bolton, Thompson accompanying us. Some of the friends 
                (engaged in business during the day) were awaiting us at Johnston's 
                &amp; we had a pretty full "College

                Meeting"— 3 being absent. We had no set programme, &amp; didn't attempt
                any elaborate speechifying, but had an ordinary social evening—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">plus</span> 
                two songs for the occasion by Dixon &amp; Johnston &amp; short speeches by 
                D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Bucke, Hutton &amp; self. D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B., 
                I believe, has given you an account of it all &amp; sent you a copy of W.D.'s song.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Law &amp; I stayed all night at Johnston's—Law leaving early next morning
                for business. It was agreed to come out here in the afternoon. Unfortunately 
                it proved to be the worst week end one could have chosen,—more than half 
                the friends having engagements wh. could not be postpon'd.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00337.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jm.00337.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00337.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                So there were only 5 of us in all. We went to the bank near Rivington Lake
                (where we had our talk May 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span>,
                &amp; of the view from which you have a picture) and there in the open air,
                D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B (seated on a camp-stool, with his back against a low stone wall, 
                the rest of us reclining on the grass round him) read us a paper on you
                wh. he intends to publish in a forthcoming book by himself &amp; Traubel, 
                &amp; which he proposes to call "Physiological Guarantees." It was an admirable paper,
                &amp; it was a great treat to us to hear it, though it contained little
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00338.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jm.00338.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00338.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                that was new. But it was a memorable &amp; never-to-be-forgotten pleasure to hear 
                D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B, your accepted "explicator," &amp; old personal friend
                give his matured conclusions about you &amp;your work. A little stammering
                talk about it after, &amp; then <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">here</span> to tea. D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J. 
                had to hurry off to catch the 6.23 train, the rest staying till 9.30. We spent the 
                interval in this room talking mainly about you, D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B. reading 
                passages from L. of G. &amp; I reading the "Song of the Universal" &amp; the "Prayer of Columbus."—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Sunday afternoon D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B. Johnston &amp; Dixon came out here 
                again, &amp; we spent a quiet afternoon.
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00339.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jm.00339.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00339.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                We had a short walk in the immediate neighbourhood, my father accompanying us.
                Johnston &amp; Dixon went on to Rivington for Thompson who came here for tea.
                We had a quiet chat about different things including Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn"—
                from which I read one or two of D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B's favourite passages.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">On Monday morning I called at Johnston's &amp; drove with D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B 
                &amp; J. to the Town Hall, Market, Library, &amp;c—&amp; then to the Station, 
                D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B. going to London by the 11.21 train.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The foregoing is a mere skeleton record of our proceedings without flesh &amp; blood, faint colors.

                But I write off hand &amp; hastily.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">No very special celebration, &amp; nothing of much importance said or done. 
                But a memorable &amp; deeply significant time to us all.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was a great thing to us to meet D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. Bucke, face to face,

                &amp; to observe how naturally he regards you as his exemplar in all things.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">He said a fine thing to me on Sunday—as we sat alone together in one of the country lanes

            <p class="tei_p">I don't remember his exact words, but they were something like these.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"I put my Whitman work before everything else,—before my wife &amp; family even, 
                &amp; no one needs to wish a finer family than mine."</p>

                I should put Walt's interest before theirs, extravagant as it may seem to say so."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Said quietly, simply, &amp; without special emphasis, &amp; quite incidentally,
                as of an old &amp; ever present principle of his life.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">His manner of perfect &amp; easy equality with each &amp; all of us—no suspicion

                Certainly I never met a man with whom I interchanged so soon &amp; so fully &amp; deeply.
                At our spree on Friday night I shook hands with him at the close of my little speech
                in token of his admission to our "College." I did it partly in jest,
                but it expressed a serious feeling (deepened since) that we regarded him
                as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one of us</span>, one, that is, of the circle of our dearest friends,
                a brother beloved.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When he comes to see us again, it will seem quite natural that he should do so, as natural
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00344.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jm.00344.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jm.00344.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                &amp; as welcome as sunshine &amp; fresh air. Sitting in this house he seemed as fitly in his place
                as a near relative might have done—&amp; as intimate &amp; close to our hearts.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">His very limitations (or what seem so) only endear him to us.
                For our own limitations are far greater—or narrower—&amp; it is good to feel
                that we have so great a brother to encourage us on the upward road where you stand supreme.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But deeper than the pleasure, instruction, &amp; stimulus of his immediate presence,
                are the hopes &amp; aims his visit suggests for the future. It seems to me to admit us into the wide

                expanding brotherhood, whose glory &amp; privilege it will be, in different spheres &amp; in 
                varying degrees, to carry on your work. May God help us to indeed consecrate ourselves to the work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B. said on Friday night that he "only wished the old man were here." 
                But we felt that he was your representative, &amp; that, at least by proxy, you 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">were</span> with us. And I thank God, with all my heart, that even such a 
                connection existed between us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>. B. read portion of a letter from you aloud. I used to consider it a 
                sufficient compensation for all the obstructions &amp; troubles of my life, that I had written
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one</span> letter that I knew had pleased you. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Now</span>, 
                I thank God, with a full heart, for all my privileges.</p>

                I agreed to keep it. It is a very affecting &amp; precious souvenir of you to me. Thanks &amp; God
