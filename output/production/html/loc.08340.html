                afternoon, bright, hot &amp; slightly misty. We took what we consider
                the best &amp; most interesting drive in the district—in the hilly
                moorland country north of the town, (all <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">flat</span>

                previous nights, &amp; was almost overpowered by his want of sleep &amp; by the heat.
                But he seemed to enjoy the drive. Thompson's quaint old fashioned garden
                interested him too, &amp; his quiet, simple, genuine hospitality. (Grown up son

                Then the drive to Bolton, Thompson accompanying us. Some of the friends

                any elaborate speechifying, but had an ordinary social evening—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">plus</span> 
                two songs for the occasion by Dixon &amp; Johnston &amp; short speeches by

                (where we had our talk May 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span>,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">16</a>

                that was new. But it was a memorable &amp; never-to-be-forgotten pleasure to hear

                had to hurry off to catch the 6.23 train, the rest staying till 9.30. We spent the

                Johnston &amp; Dixon went on to Rivington for Thompson who came here for tea.
                We had a quiet chat about different things including Mark Twain's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">20</a> "Huckleberry Finn"—
                from which I read one or two of D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> B's favourite passages.</p>

                Certainly I never met a man with whom I interchanged so soon &amp; so fully &amp; deeply.
                At our spree on Friday night I shook hands with him at the close of my little speech
                in token of his admission to our "College." I did it partly in jest,

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    and one son, Wallace (1893–1898). Anne was unimpressed with Whitman's work
                    when she first read it, but later became enraptured by what she called its
                    "pulsating, illumined life," and she joined Horace as associate editor of his

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    humorist, novelist, lecturer, and publisher. Twain is best known for authoring
                    such novels as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</span> (1876), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</span> (1884), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pudd'nhead Wilson</span> (1894). Twain attended Whitman's

                    stuffed and placed on the mantle beneath a photograph. Warry had apparently
                    suggested that the poet give it to the Bolton group. Bucke duly took it with him
                    when he went to England. On August 3 Wallace wrote to Davis: "I need not to tell
                    you how deeply I prize it. It is a very precious &amp; affecting souvenir of Mr.
                    Whitman—of his lonely room, his thoughts &amp; memories, &amp; the cheer
                    received from the canary's (also caged imprisoned) joyous warblings. It connects
