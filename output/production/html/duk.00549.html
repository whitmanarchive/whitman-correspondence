            <p class="tei_p">i
                recieved your
             letter yesterday as usual
            it was all
            right and am glad to hear you are
            feeling pretty well and every thing
            goes on pretty well with you you
            are so attached to washington i
            dont beleive you ever would be 
             contented any where else i dont
            wonder at it for i think you have
            more true friends there than any
            other place) i mean those not related
            to you of course) i suppose it makes
            you feel awkard to go to mr Oconors    
            their not being friendly and you being
            friendly to both but when they move
            it will be different
            its very 
                disagreabl<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">e</span>
            to live in one house and not be on
            speaking terms i should think the oconors
            was the last people to fall out with)
            well Walt here we are yet in the
            same old place but i doo want to get out of it very much indeed there
            is so many children and not the best
            i ever see but a continual traveling
            up and down from morning till night</p>
