            wonder at it for i think you have
            more true friends there than any
            other place) i mean those not related
            to you of course) i suppose it makes
            you feel awkard to go to mr Oconors    
            their not being friendly and you being
            friendly to both but when they move

            to live in one house and not be on
            speaking terms i should think the oconors

                    26, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter August 19, 1868. Clarence
                    Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver agreed with Bucke's date, and Edwin Haviland Miller
                    cited Gohdes and Silver to date this letter (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews
                        &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</span> [Durham,
                    North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 198–199; Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–75], 2:366). The surmised date based on corresponding topics with
                    Walt Whitman's <a href="duk.00652">August 24, 1868</a> letter to Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman is reasonable but incorrect: the letter must follow George
                    Washington Whitman's receipt of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's August 20,
                    1868 letter (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear
                        Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</span> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
                    State University Press, 1984], 128–129). The date accepted by Gohdes and
                    Silver and Miller is consistent with subjects in two letters from Walt Whitman,
                    one before August 19 and one after. Louisa discussed the house that George
                    Washington Whitman was building at 1149 Atlantic Avenue, conceivably in response
                    to a query in Walt's <a href="uva.00352">August 13–17, 1868</a>
                    letter to Louisa. Louisa also reacted to a "falling out" between the O'Connors
                    and Ursula North Burroughs, which Walt also discussed in that letter. Finally,
                    she noted that Walt was "so attached to washington," an observation to which
                    Walt seems to have responded in his <a href="duk.00652">August 24,
                        1868</a> letter to Louisa. Despite the seeming corroboration of these
                    three topics, however, discussion of them presumably continued through multiple
                    letters. The letter to dates August 26, 1868, a week later, after George has
                    received a $510 draft from Jeff Whitman. Since Jeff referred to an "enclosed
                    draft" in the same amount in his letter to George, Louisa's statement that
                    George has received Jeff's draft must follow Jeff's letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    Washington Whitman co-owned with his partner Smith was at 1149 Atlantic Avenue.
                    Walt Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically
                    and in effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an
                    "honest, conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish
                    middle age" (see Walt's <a href="med.00422">September 2, 1873</a> letter
                    to Burroughs). George purchased the property outright from Smith, and Louisa Van
