            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote you yesterday, (Monday,) which I suppose you rec'd, with the money. I have just heard from Han, &amp; I write to-day because I knew it would be a comfort to you to know right away. Heyde has just sent me a letter—he seems to be in a very good humor—writes a lot of stuff—but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> about domestic affairs this time—on "poetry" &amp; "criticism" &amp;c. &amp;c—of no interest at all to me—then at the close of the letter he says:</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"Han is much better than usual, &amp; is constantly promising to write to her mother."<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I send you the part of the N. Y. Times, containing a good long piece about me. It is the N. Y. Daily Times, of Sunday, Dec 2—but perhaps George or Jeff brought it to you last Sunday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel pretty well generally—with now &amp; then a poorish spell—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am going to hear the great actress Ristori<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> to-morrow night. One of my fellow clerks has taken a seat for me, &amp; made me a present of it—the play is "Queen Elisabeth"—I wish you &amp; Mat could go with me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The piece in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> is by O'Connor.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> He grows stronger &amp; stronger, &amp; fiercer &amp; fiercer in his championship of "Leaves of Grass"—no one can ever say a word against it in his presence, without a storm. Did you get the "Galaxy" of Dec 1—?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William Swinton<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> is here in Washington, temporarily. He is interested in speculating in gold. It is very fine weather here to-day. I am writing this by my big window, where I can look out on the water—the sun is shining bright as silver.</p>

                    Swinburne and spoke critically of Whitman's poetry.

                    to his suspension as a reporter on July 1, 1864. Whitman did not have a high
                    opinion of William's journalism; see his letter from <a href="loc.00834">June 10, 1864</a>. He was professor of English at the University of
                    California from 1869 to 1874. Thereafter he compiled extremely successful
                    textbooks, and established the magazine <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Story-Teller</span>, in
                    1883. He was the brother of John Swinton, managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>; see the letter of <a href="bos.00006">February 23, 1863</a> from Walt Whitman to John Swinton.
