            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote you yesterday, (Monday,) which I suppose you rec'd, with the money. I have just heard from Han, &amp; I write to-day because I knew it would be a comfort to you to know right away. Heyde has just sent me a letter—he seems to be in a very good humor—writes a lot of stuff—but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> about domestic affairs this time—on "poetry" &amp; "criticism" &amp;c. &amp;c—of no interest at all to me—then at the close of the letter he says:</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"Han is much better than usual, &amp; is constantly promising to write to her mother."
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I send you the part of the N. Y. Times, containing a good long piece about me. It is the N. Y. Daily Times, of Sunday, Dec 2—but perhaps George or Jeff brought it to you last Sunday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel pretty well generally—with now &amp; then a poorish spell—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am going to hear the great actress Ristori to-morrow night. One of my fellow clerks has taken a seat for me, &amp; made me a present of it—the play is "Queen Elisabeth"—I wish you &amp; Mat could go with me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The piece in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> is by O'Connor. He grows stronger &amp; stronger, &amp; fiercer &amp; fiercer in his championship of "Leaves of Grass"—no one can ever say a word against it in his presence, without a storm. Did you get the "Galaxy" of Dec 1—?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William Swinton is here in Washington, temporarily. He is interested in speculating in gold. It is very fine weather here to-day. I am writing this by my big window, where I can look out on the water—the sun is shining bright as silver.</p>
