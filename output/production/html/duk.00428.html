                    <p class="tei_p">Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date October 26, 1863 to this letter on an
                        accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not reproduced
                        here). Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University
                        Press, 1961–77], 1:374). Because this letter echoes Walt Whitman's
                        description of his new boarding arrangement with Eliza S. Baker, the letter
                        must be in response to his <a href="loc.00799">October 20, 1863</a>
                        letter. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote on the Monday (she dated the letter
                        "Monday evening") following her receipt of Walt's letter, so the date
                        October 26, 1863 is correct.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r12">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00428_n8 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00428_n8"><span>Walt Whitman's concerns
