            <p class="tei_p">As we are now "on the eve of an important election,"
                such meetings as I have attempted to describe in my last are frequent here. They are
                held by whigs and democrats, Taylorites and Clayites—Barnburners 
                and Old Hunkers. I
                have noticed, however, that the Clay whigs and the Barnburner democrats seem to be
                the most anxious to hold these grand talking matches. The other parties call as few
                as possible.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">There is much complaint in and about the city, among all classes, 
                of "dull times." I know very many mechanics who are out of work, and can't get pay for
                work they have done. This is the complaint among all branches and trades, to an
                unusual extent. Immigration pours in without the least abatement. Hardly a day
                passes that hundreds of poor wayfarers from Europe do not land upon our wharves;
                some no doubt, to sink amid disease or poverty, but most, I am happy to say, to take
                a start which brings them amid better times and far more comfort. What is most
                astonishing to me, is the fact that with such prevalent poverty as characterises the
                masses of the immigrants, there is so little criminality. Political economists are
                fond of arguing that Penury is the Mother of Crime: but take an equal number of
                well-off people, and, compared with these immigrants, you will surely find not only
                a great deal more viciousness, but infinitely more of crime which the law takes
                cognizance of. The police very seldom have any trouble with the poor
                immigrants—except, alas! now and then to take a pallid mother and her starving
                children to the alms house. There are certain persons who see evil in these
                accessions from abroad; but I defy even them to contradict the well-known facts
                above mentioned. Moreover, this city is the great receiving point of European
                emigration.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">A very general satisfaction exists here at the prospect presented by the
                advent of the steamer "Crescent City," of reducing the travelling time between New
                York and New Orleans, to a point before considered out of the question, except in
                rare cases, and then only by being racked to death with incessant travel and daily
                changes. It is now pretty certain that, when you get off the levee at New Orleans of
                a Sunday morning, and go on board the right sort of steamer, the next Sunday will
                find you in New York—and vice versa. By the inland route, either down the Ohio or
                across the Lakes, you require, allowing for unavoidable stoppages, detentions, etc.,
                from thirteen to twenty days, averaging fifteen days at least. Then the comfort of
                making the entire trip without transferring yourself or baggage. My belief is that
                New York and New Orleans have more identity of character and interest than any other
                two cities in America. Both are distinguished by a sort of citizen-of-the-world
                disposition; and in both there is a blessed freedom from all provincialism and the
                gossip of second-rate towns. May the telegraph and a few lines of rapid steamers
                conduce to draw still closer and stouter the bands of union!</p>
