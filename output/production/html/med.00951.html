            <p class="tei_p">As we are now "on the eve of an important election,"
                such meetings as I have attempted to describe in my last are frequent here. They are
                held by whigs<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">1</a> and democrats, Taylorites<a href="#n10b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10b">2</a> and Clayites<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—Barnburners 
                and Old Hunkers.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> I
                have noticed, however, that the Clay whigs and the Barnburner democrats seem to be
                the most anxious to hold these grand talking matches. The other parties call as few
                as possible.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">There is much complaint in and about the city, among all classes, 
                of "dull times." I know very many mechanics who are out of work, and can't get pay for
                work they have done. This is the complaint among all branches and trades, to an
                unusual extent. Immigration pours in without the least abatement. Hardly a day
                passes that hundreds of poor wayfarers from Europe do not land upon our wharves;
                some no doubt, to sink amid disease or poverty, but most, I am happy to say, to take
                a start which brings them amid better times and far more comfort. What is most
                astonishing to me, is the fact that with such prevalent poverty as characterises the
                masses of the immigrants, there is so little criminality. Political economists are
                fond of arguing that Penury is the Mother of Crime: but take an equal number of
                well-off people, and, compared with these immigrants, you will surely find not only
                a great deal more viciousness, but infinitely more of crime which the law takes
                cognizance of. The police very seldom have any trouble with the poor
                immigrants—except, alas! now and then to take a pallid mother and her starving
                children to the alms house. There are certain persons who see evil in these
                accessions from abroad; but I defy even them to contradict the well-known facts
                above mentioned. Moreover, this city is the great receiving point of European
                emigration.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">A very general satisfaction exists here at the prospect presented by the
                advent of the steamer "Crescent City," of reducing the travelling time between New
                York and New Orleans, to a point before considered out of the question, except in
                rare cases, and then only by being racked to death with incessant travel and daily
                changes. It is now pretty certain that, when you get off the levee at New Orleans of
                a Sunday morning, and go on board the right sort of steamer, the next Sunday will
                find you in New York—and vice versa. By the inland route, either down the Ohio or
                across the Lakes, you require, allowing for unavoidable stoppages, detentions, etc.,
                from thirteen to twenty days, averaging fifteen days at least. Then the comfort of
                making the entire trip without transferring yourself or baggage. My belief is that
                New York and New Orleans have more identity of character and interest than any other
                two cities in America. Both are distinguished by a sort of citizen-of-the-world
                disposition; and in both there is a blessed freedom from all provincialism and the
                gossip of second-rate towns. May the telegraph and a few lines of rapid steamers
                conduce to draw still closer and stouter the bands of union!</p>

                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n10b">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n10b tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n10b"><span>The term
                    "Taylorites" refers to the political supporters of Zachary Taylor
                    (1784–1850). A Southern slaveholder and a well-known American miltary 
                    leader in the Mexican-American War, Taylor was the successful Whig Candidate 
                    for president in 1848, becoming the twelfth president of the
                    United States from 1849 until his death in 1850. </span></span> [<a href="#r10b">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00951_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00951_n2"><span>The term "Clayites"
                refers to political supporters of Henry Clay (1777–1852). Clay was an attorney
                who went on to serve in the House of Representatives and as United States
                Senator from Kentucky. Clay ran for president in the
                elections of 1824, 1832, and 1844, and, although he was unsuccesful in his 
                bids for the presidency, he was one of the founders of the Whig Party
                and of the National Republican Party. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00950_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00950_n1"><span>Barnburners and Hunkers were terms used to describe 
                    opposing sides of the fracturing Democratic party in New York during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
                    reflected the national divisions that would lead to the American Civil War (1861–1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
