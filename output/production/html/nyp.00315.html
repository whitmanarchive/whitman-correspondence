        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote you a short &amp; very hurried letter last night, only a few minutes before the mail closed—
        To-day Mrs. O'Connor has just paid me a pleasant visit—&amp; I have been eating my lunch 
        of a roast apple &amp; biscuit—I am feeling about the same—I suppose you are most tired, 
        and perhaps a little suspicious of hearing I am "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">about the same</span>"—
        Well I am quite tired myself, &amp; want much to get out, &amp; go to work, &amp; go about—
        But I just have to make the best of it, &amp; console myself with realizing 
        that disagreeable as it is, it might be a great deal worse—&amp; that I am 
        feeling free from pain &amp; comparatively comforting, &amp; that it cannot be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very long</span> 
        before I shall have the good use of my limbs again—So I just try to keep patient 
        &amp; wait—&amp; you must too, dearest mother—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I got a good letter from Hattie to-day, dated March 9—she says she was writing to you—
        so I suppose you have one too—They seem to like it at Mr &amp; Mrs. Buckley's.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I got your letter of Monday and Lou's of Sunday—it is an affection of the leg from the knee downward, partially helpless—
        but the principal trouble is yet in the head, &amp; so easily getting fatigued—
        my whole body feels heavy, &amp; sometimes my hand—Still, I go out a little 
        every day almost—accompanied by Peter, or some one—sometimes spend an hour out, 
        but cannot walk, except a very little indeed, very slowly indeed—
        Mother, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">my looks</span> you would hardly know the least thing had been the matter with me—
        I am neither pale nor thin in the least—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Friday forenoon <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>March 14.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here in my room—it is very pleasant out apparently—
        I generally go out a little between two &amp; three, and shall 
        probably get out a little this afternoon—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">John Burroughs has been on here again—he is trying to sell or let his house, 
        &amp; does not succeed very satisfactorily—he left here again by the train last evening 
        &amp; returned north—his wife is here—Mother, I send the Harper's Weekly—
        that picture gives a very good idea of the Capitol, (what they call the east front)—
        in the Extra is a picture of the inauguration ball—very good, 
        they say—you must look over them Sunday—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, it is now after 12—I expect to get out 
        a little from 2 to 3—Love to you &amp; to Lou &amp; George &amp; all.
      </p>
