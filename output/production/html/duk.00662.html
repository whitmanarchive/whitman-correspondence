        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I send you Jeff's letter to me, just received. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mat is better, it seems, &amp; has put off journeying to Camden. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Jeff says it is doubtful whether she will come at all, unless she can have you go home with
        her to St. Louis. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, just let the thing take its course, &amp; not disturb your mind on the question of
        going or not going—It will be time enough to decide, when it comes to the
        point—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mammy dear, I got your letter this morning—glad to hear you are as well as you are,
        &amp; hope this will find you comfortable—All goes well as usual with me—Love to
        you, dear mother—&amp; to all—</p>

        <p class="tei_p">Mother, just as I was closing this letter, who should come in to see me but Margaret
            Avery—she has been down to Virginia, and is going
          through Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia—When in Philadelphia, she will come over to
          Camden &amp; make you a call—probably within a day or two—</p>
