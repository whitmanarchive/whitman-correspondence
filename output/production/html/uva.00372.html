        <span class="tei_salute">My dear young man,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letters have been most welcome to me—welcome to me as Person, &amp; then as
        Author—I don't know which most—You did well to write to me so unconventionally,
        so fresh, so manly, &amp; so affectionately too. I too hope (though it is not probable) that
        we shall one day personally meet each other. Meantime I send you my friendship &amp; thanks. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Edward Dowden's letter containing among others your subscription for a
        copy of my new edition, has just been rec'd. I shall send the books very soon by express in
        a package to his address. I have just written to E. D.
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My physique is entirely shatter'd—doubtless permanently—from paralysis &amp;
        other ailments. But I am up &amp; dress'd, &amp; get out every day a little—live here
        quite lonesome, but hearty, &amp; good spirits. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Write to me again. </p>
