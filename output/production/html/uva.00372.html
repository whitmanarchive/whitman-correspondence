      <p class="tei_p">Your letters have been most welcome to me—welcome to me as Person, &amp; then as
        Author—I don't know which most—You did well to write to me so unconventionally,
        so fresh, so manly, &amp; so affectionately too. I too hope (though it is not probable) that
        we shall one day personally meet each other. Meantime I send you my friendship &amp; thanks. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Edward Dowden's<a href="#n0199" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0199">3</a> letter containing among others your subscription for a
        copy of my new edition, has just been rec'd. I shall send the books very soon by express in
        a package to his address. I have just written to E. D.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My physique is entirely shatter'd—doubtless permanently—from paralysis &amp;
        other ailments. But I am up &amp; dress'd, &amp; get out every day a little—live here
        quite lonesome, but hearty, &amp; good spirits. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Write to me again. </p>

                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving</span> (1906). As a
                    young man, on February 18, 1872, Stoker wrote a personal, eccentric letter to
                    Walt Whitman which he did not send until <a href="loc.01945">February 14,
                        1876</a>. In the earlier letter he had written: "How sweet a thing it is
                    for a strong healthy man with a woman's eyes and a child's wishes to feel that
                    he can speak so to a man [Walt Whitman] who can be if he wishes, father, and
                    brother and wife to his soul." Stoker visited Walt Whitman in 1884 (Gay Wilson

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                        <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>, 299). For more, see Philip W.
