                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For

                    1867, Bucke read Whitman's poetry for the first time and became a devoted
                    follower; he visited Whitman in Camden in 1877. Bucke became the poet's first
                    biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
                    1883) and was one of Whitman's literary executors after Whitman's death in 1892.
                    Bucke also provided a date (usually the year) for many of Hannah's letters to
                    Whitman. For more information, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice (1837–1901)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    ideally suited for industrialization because of its proximity to Philadelphia
                    and to the Delaware and Cooper Rivers. During the second half of the nineteenth
                    century Camden experienced tremendous growth in factories, lumber firms, mills,
                    and chemical plants. See George R. Prowell, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden County, New
                        Jersey</span> (Philadelphia: L.J. Richards, 1886), for a description of the
                    "Porcelain Tooth Manufactury, at No. 314 Mickle St." which employed fifteen
                    laborers and produced 1500 "full sets of teeth each week" (530). Whitman
                    listened for the factory whistles during the day and evening and marked the time
                    of day by them, as his comment illustrates. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
