            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have leave of absence commencing first of next week, and intend coming on to New York, 
                for a while, to spend the first part of it. Are you so fixed that 
                you can give me a room? You must answer candidly no, if not—please write at once—I am well as usual—nothing very new or important with me. 
                The advent of the new Attorney General, Mr. Evarts,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> does not seem likely to affect my position here.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> 
                But there have been many dismissals of clerks in the Departments. The O'Connors are well—the little girl has picked up amazingly—goes about, indeed, as strong &amp; nimble as a grasshopper—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">In a late letter, Mother said she had not seen any thing of Helen or 
                Emily for some time—I suppose you have been off in the country.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Love to all—&amp; good bye for the present.</p>

                    (1818–1901) was chief counsel for Andrew Johnson during the impeachment
                    trial of 1868. As a reward for his services, Johnson appointed Evarts Attorney
                    General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and
                    U.S. Senator from New York from 1885 to 1891. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00025_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00025_n3"><span>On <a href="loc.01822">October 9, 1868</a>, however, O'Connor wrote
                    cryptically to Walt Whitman: "I had a long and free talk with [Ashton] about Mat
                    Pleasants and Evarts, in connexion with you, which I must tell you about when we
                    meet. It made me feel quite anxious, but I guess all's right, while Ashton is
                    there. Pleasants is a miserable devil. I wish I had power in that office for a
                    little while. I'd put a spoke in the wheel of his vendetta, which would carry it
                    and him to a safe distance." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
