            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have leave of absence commencing first of next week, and intend coming on to New York, 
                for a while, to spend the first part of it. Are you so fixed that 
                you can give me a room? You must answer candidly no, if not—please write at once—I am well as usual—nothing very new or important with me. 
                The advent of the new Attorney General, Mr. Evarts, does not seem likely to affect my position here. 
                But there have been many dismissals of clerks in the Departments. The O'Connors are well—the little girl has picked up amazingly—goes about, indeed, as strong &amp; nimble as a grasshopper—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">In a late letter, Mother said she had not seen any thing of Helen or 
                Emily for some time—I suppose you have been off in the country.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Love to all—&amp; good bye for the present.</p>
