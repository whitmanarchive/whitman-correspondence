            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">By your note of 18th, from New York, just received, I find that Mr. Edmund Routledge, 
                editor, would (I quote) like to keep &amp; use an original poem—three-page poem—sent him from me, but demurs to my first-asked price—that he directs you to offer me 10 pounds—which you can send me, $50: in gold—and that, (the terms being settled, &amp;c.) 
                he will advertise it very largely.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I accept the terms offered—$50 in gold—and you can forward me the am't as soon as convenient. 
                I repeat, that I distinctly reserve the right of printing the piece in a future edition of my poems.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Sending best wishes &amp; respects to editor &amp; publishers, I remain.</p>
