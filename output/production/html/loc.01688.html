            <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter of the 14th. So you are going to Kansas, &amp; it would
                seem you think of settling there—so it may be we shall not see each
                other—but I wish you to write to me, &amp; let me know how it goes with
                you—&amp; I hope, dear boy, you will continue to remember me with a love
                which time shall not fade out.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I appreciate your kindness &amp; your hospitable invitations, &amp; I am sure it
                would be a good change &amp; a comfort to me to come out &amp; see you, &amp; be
                with you a few days, surrounded with new scenery, &amp; a farm life—it is what
                I should enjoy of all things—and I hope things may work so that I can come one
                of these days—if so, I will send you word, in advance—The picture of the
                dear daughter will be welcome—I should also like another of my dear loving boy
                Alfred, as soon as he gets any late ones, if he does so—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">So good bye &amp; God bless you, my dear friends, &amp; my love to all.</p>
