            <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter of the 14th. So you are going to Kansas, &amp; it would
                seem you think of settling there—so it may be we shall not see each
                other—but I wish you to write to me, &amp; let me know how it goes with
                you—&amp; I hope, dear boy, you will continue to remember me with a love
                which time shall not fade out.</p>

                I should enjoy of all things—and I hope things may work so that I can come one
                of these days—if so, I will send you word, in advance—The picture of the
                dear daughter will be welcome—I should also like another of my dear loving boy

                    <p class="tei_p">On <a href="loc.01817">January 14, 1870</a>, Alfred spoke of his
                        departure for Kansas, and John offered to send a picture of his "daughter,"
                        whom Alfred had married in August 1868: "She ways about 100 lbs and is as
                        handsome as a picture." (A picture of Alfred and his wife at the time of
                        their marriage is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                        Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) He
                        concluded: "please write soon to your unworthy friends" (Charles E. Feinberg
                        Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                        Congress, Washington, D.C.). On <a href="yal.00128">March 15,
                        1870</a>, John informed Walt Whitman that Alfred had left on January 25,
                        1870, and had settled in "Douglass," Kansas. This was apparently the last
                        letter in the correspondence.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
