        <span class="tei_salute">Dear son,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote you a letter last Tuesday, 6th, which I suppose you have rec'd. The last I have
        from you was yours of Sunday, 4th. I am still here in Brooklyn, quite busy with the
        printing. I have rec'd a letter from John Rowland who is working for me in the office,
        complaining that he has to work too hard—I should think by his letter he means to back
        out of his bargain with me—if so, it will be a bad loss &amp; inconvenience to
        me—But I shall not fret about it—whatever happens. It is likely that this will
        shorten my leave, &amp; that I shall have to come back &amp; do my work myself, about the
        end of the month. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Pete, I hope you are having good times, &amp; are in good spirits. We are having quite
        coolish weather here. The drivers wear their overcoats mornings &amp; evenings. As I sit
        here writing Friday afternoon, it is cloudy &amp; threatens rain. I am going over to New
        York in an hour or so, &amp; shall leave this in the P. O., and then go around
        awhile—possibly going to Niblo's Theatre, as they play Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar"
        to-night, with Davenport &amp; quite a bunch of stars in the piece—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Son, I am afraid I shall not make out much of a letter this time—but you take it so
        hard when I don't write, I thought I would send a few lines—they would be better than
        nothing—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">God bless you, my loving boy—&amp; farewell for this time. </p>
