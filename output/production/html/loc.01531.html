        <span class="tei_salute">Dear son,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I wrote you a letter last Tuesday, 6th, which I suppose you have rec'd. The last I have
        from you was yours of Sunday, 4th. I am still here in Brooklyn, quite busy with the
        printing. I have rec'd a letter from John Rowland who is working for me in the office,
        complaining that he has to work too hard—I should think by his letter he means to back
        out of his bargain with me—if so, it will be a bad loss &amp; inconvenience to
        me—But I shall not fret about it—whatever happens. It is likely that this will
        shorten my leave, &amp; that I shall have to come back &amp; do my work myself, about the
        end of the month. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear Pete, I hope you are having good times, &amp; are in good spirits. We are having quite
        coolish weather here. The drivers wear their overcoats mornings &amp; evenings. As I sit
        here writing Friday afternoon, it is cloudy &amp; threatens rain. I am going over to New
        York in an hour or so, &amp; shall leave this in the P. O., and then go around
        awhile—possibly going to Niblo's Theatre<a href="#n0442" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0442">2</a>, as they play Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar"
        to-night, with Davenport &amp; quite a bunch of stars in the piece<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Son, I am afraid I shall not make out much of a letter this time—but you take it so
        hard when I don't write, I thought I would send a few lines—they would be better than
        nothing—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">God bless you, my loving boy—&amp; farewell for this time. </p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Niblo's Theatre was built in 1834 by coffeehouse owner William Niblo as a way
                        to supplement the entertainment value of his refreshment "resort." Rebuilt
                        in 1849 after an 1846 fire, Niblo's Theatre saw a significant increase in
                        business after the Civil War. It was destroyed in another fire in 1872,
                        later rebuilt by Alexander Turney Stewart (1903–1876) before closing
                        in 1895 to make way for an office building for sugar refiner Henry Osborne
                        Havemeyer (1847–1907).</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r0442">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01531_n2 note" id="loc.01531_n2"><span>Walt Whitman did not see this play on
