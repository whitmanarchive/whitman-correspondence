            <p class="tei_p">Rarely, at any former period, has the health of the
                city been worse, without an epidemic, than at present. Dysentery is the most
                prevalent disease, carrying off scores and scores every week. It is particularly
                destructive among children. In my circle of acquaintances, I know four families, who
                have lost from two to four children each by this destructive malady. It attacks
                grown persons, also, with severity—though its most unmanageable cases are those in
                persons under 16 years of age. Nor does a change of residence to the country afford
                any relief. Several families that have been for some time out in the country,
                principally on account of their children, have been obliged to return; in one large
                country boarding-house on Long Island, seven persons died last Sunday, and five on
                Monday.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The surrounding regions are suffering very much from drought. Corn and
                potatoes, in certain section, will be quite cut off—many fields are so already. A
                heavy shower here, a few days since, was confined to the immediate neighborhood of
                the city; and even here it does not seem to have modified the heat.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Our city streets
                present a plentiful sprinkling of well-dressed, bronze-faced personages, from the
                West Indies—families who have removed hither in consequence of the troubles among
                the slaves of those regions. A great many hundreds of these West Indians are in
                town. They must affect lounging in Broadway; and their easy, indolent air, sometimes
                exemplified in the person of a fine-looking brunette, may be seen on that famous
                pavement, at almost any hour of the day.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The editors of New York are vigorously
                plying their pens in politics—each with his peculiar preferences and dislikes. Our
                friend of the Tribune hath a somewhat vague, disconsolate method of procedure; the
                tendency of his editorials, however, is plainly in support of "the Buffaloes." The
                Courier and Enquirer is ardent and most industrious in its advocacy of Gen. Taylor,
                each number having one or more vigorous articles to the praise and admiration of the
                old hero. The Express has also, since the nomination, laid its Clayism on the shelf,
                and goes for Taylor, "without a why or wherefore." The Express likes, as a side
                amusement, to have one or two little personal quarrels with brother newspapers—and
                generally, indeed, is furnished with abundance of such recreation. The Evening Post
                contains incessant appeals and arguments in behalf of Van Buren and "the
                non-extension of slavery;" with occasional dashes at Mr. Polk and Secretary Marcy.
                The Globe ditto—only more so. The Herald gives its editorial speculations and its
                "news to the latest moment," as usual. The Sun "goes in" for Cuba; and furnishes its
                habitual melange of news and advertisements. The Morning Star seems to be pursuing
                an imitative tack after the Sun. The Commercial Advertiser is certainly conducted
                with more ability than ever before;—it supports Taylor, with an occasional squinting
                towards Buffaloism. The Sunday papers are professedly neutral; but I believe the
                Atlas goes for Taylor, and the Times leans to Cass.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have another great meeting
                to-night, at Vauxhall, in behalf of Ireland's rights, and to collect money for her,
                now, in her time of sorest need. Funds are pouring in by thousands—and thousands
                more behind! O, that we may not be disappointed in our hopes!</p>
