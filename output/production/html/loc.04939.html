            <p class="tei_p">This moment yearning and thoughtful I turn back and think of that old man whom I met but once only for a few
                minutes, His books read and absorbed in part, his life, a part of it read of asking about of men lingers
                about the ferry houses, looking for a glimpse of his face at the little former house yet never seeing him, wondering eager
                over the names since first I saw or heard it, now learning to love the man the book and the author. I have two photographs,
                one in book, the other lately taken, within ten years. I look at the engraving in Leaves of Grass, at the gray in the beard
                at the features all absorbing and always wondering "if only he could know" everything is all light, transparent as light,
                yet all dark and moody and tearful I would prize above all earthly things to see you and loaf awhile and ask you so much
                and so many things. I wonder now if you still are the same lover of God and man
                unconventionally as is portrayed in Leaves of Grass.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I read not long ago in the Century a line "the vagaries of my life"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> 
                This troubled me—is the book and its plan and purpose a vagary.
                All the teaching of the native inherent immortality of the soul, is this a

                vagary. The Hebrew Scriptures declare so, the New Testament writings declare so. "If you love me, keep

                I am sorry that the People do not understand, but as yet, the people of the States have 
                not arisen, wait for the fusion of 
                nationalities and the type shall come forth. I hear much talk of the Lord's coming, 
                but all things center on this our globe.
                I cannot understand much of these things, only of my love and affection this I am sure of. 
                May I call my self a pupil—Dear old man you are beloved more
                than you can know this is the best I have and you have it. I see you there and my hearts 
                love goes out to you to night across
                seas and continents, now three score years and ten and soon to be yours, if only America 
                would listen and the young men and young women could see that ideal life:
