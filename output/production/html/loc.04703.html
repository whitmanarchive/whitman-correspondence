            <p class="tei_p">We were very much pleased to receive your kind postcard of Feb 26<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>, addressed to Dr. Johnston, &amp; only wish that you could have reported an improved
                condition of health, instead of "about same." We hope to receive better news

            <p class="tei_p">I can't write much now, but will send you a copy of a very kind &amp; friendly letter
                I have received from J.A. Symonds, which will no doubt interest
                you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Not the least interesting thing about it to me is the frank cordial spirit of
                comradeship &amp; kindness, ("real &amp; not fictitious") it reveals, &amp; which
                seems to distinguish those who are "sealed of the tribe of Walt."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The "forgeries" he refers to are facsimile copies of a letter &amp; post cards
                received from you which I made &amp; sent him—along with copies Dr. J. had
                made of letters from Traubel &amp; Warry. (I afterwords sent him a copy of Dr. Bucke's letter).</p>

                    intended to send you a copy of one of my letters. I don't think it worth it, but
                    I allowed him to do as he wished.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">It is addressed to the friend in Liverpool who procured my copy of the 1855
                    edition of L of G. He had looked into it, but could make nothing of it. In a
                    hurried note he told me his impressions (adverse ones) &amp; asked what I had to
                    say about them. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01127.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01127.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01127.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                    When I replied I was tired &amp; out of sorts. And I felt that it was labour
                    thrown away (in a sense) as he was quite unlikely to come under your influence.
                    He is many years older than I. But he is one of the most respected &amp; valued
                    of my friends, &amp; I owed him such return as I could make for many kindnesses;
                    so I wrote at some length. But the letter is too elementary &amp; inadequate to
                    be worth your perusal, &amp; was, of course, only meant to meet the special case

                <p class="tei_p">Johnston received a letter yesterday morning from Capt. Nowell, in which he mentioned that he had told you of a copy of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of G</span>. he had seen offered for sale in L'pool for
