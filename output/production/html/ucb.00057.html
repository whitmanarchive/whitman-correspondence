            <p class="tei_p">Yours <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ , &amp; glad to hear from you. Wonder if you—or you &amp;
                    Guernsey<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—couldn't help me a little. I am
                coming on to Boston in ten or twelve days to remain about two months—&amp; I
                want a plain boardinghouse or good furnished room secured, so I can go right
                there—Let me give you fuller particulars. Osgood &amp; Co: are going to
                publish a complete &amp; new volume of my poems, &amp; I am coming on to see to
                &amp; oversee it, every page—will take six or eight weeks. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I
                    want quarters near, or eligible to get at, their printing office</span>, so I can
                be there two or three hours every day, handy—What I want of you is to
                ascertain (if you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span></span> know already—is it Cambridge?) where their printing is done,
                &amp; then secure me either board in full, not more than 6, 7 or $8 a
                week—or a nice furnished room handy as I said. I trust you or Guernsey to know
                what would suit me &amp; do for me—Try to write me here, so I can get it by
                first of next week, say 15th or 16th—as I shall want to be coming on within
                two or three days after that—If you go to Osgood's show them this letter. I am
                well as usual of late—have been jaunting about the Long Island &amp; Jersey
                shores &amp;c. last two weeks.</p>

                    (1850–1927) was on the staff of the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>.
                    Apparently he met Whitman for the first time when he delivered his Lincoln
                    address in Boston in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and
                    Trowbridge," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many
                    newspaper columns in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to
                    obtain a pension for the poet. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_ucb.00057_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="ucb.00057_n2"><span>Like Baxter, Frederic R.
