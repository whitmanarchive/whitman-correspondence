            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Your friends here—and you may be satisfied you have
                "some" in these diggings—are delighted at beholding such an evidence of prosperity
                as the advent of your large and beautiful Weekly—which I submitted this morning, to
                the inspection of a knot of our craft, and of journalists, who all pronounced it a
                model newspaper. I hope you will keep up the character of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">variety</span> which appears in
                it, and which is as much the spice of a newspaper, as of life. You needn't blush
                when I tell you that among good judges here, the Crescent is considered to be the
                best Daily in the south-west. Moreover, you know, print people are not over-fond of
                praising their contemporaries; and don't do it without strong cause.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The great topic
                of interest here (since the election is settled) appears to proceed from the
                existence of the cholera, which has arrived at last, sure enough. Thus far it has
                been kept at the Quarantine station on Staten Island, about seven miles below the
                city. Some three of four cases were landed from the Liverpool liner New York, a week
                ago; they were bedded in a large room, where there were several other sick persons.
                As others were landed, they went in the same room. But not many hours elapsed before
                some of the other sick persons exhibited symptoms of cholera too. The doctors,
                however, (who, as a class, are the most self-opinioned creatures under the sun,)
                wouldn't separate the original patients, till the spread of the disease threatened
                alarming consequences. They <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">did</span> separate them, though, at last, and put the 
                cholera patients in an isolated place, by themselves. Since that time, the disease has
                spread little or none. From the best information, there have been about twenty
                cases; and half of these have resulted fatally. It must be borne in mind, at the
                same time, that most of these cases were of persons who were in all likelihood
                debilitated by disease or dissipation, and their systems sank under the exhausting
                drain of cholera. The weather, too, has been remarkably bad, for health. For the
                last three days—during Wednesday, Thursday and Friday—the air has been filled with a
                heavy, stagnated, foggy wetness, and the streets with mud and filth, and every object
                covered with clammy moisture. Of course, too, nearly every disease is now, through
                the popular alarm, converted into cholera.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">We shall soon see how all this will
                change when there comes a dry, keen frost. I know the cry is that weather makes no
                great difference in the spread of the dreaded disease; but that is nonsense. When
                the nature of the atmosphere is completely changed, and exhalations are not
                developed, it looks likely that the same effects will ensue as from totally
                different causes!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Our young men are in some commotion, induced by the golden
                realities of California; and there is talk of fitting out ships, and much people
                going in them, to hoe up the gold. What splendid visions! and how much more
                reliable, too, than splendid visions usually are! <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Havn't​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Haven't​

                down," in New York. Let us hope that the yellow tide will have to set this way,
                (through New Orleans, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of course</span>,) and that editors and printers and newspaper
                correspondents, may get some of it, with the rest.</p>

                and the canals ditto, produce of all kinds remains low in price and plentiful in
                quantity. The latter part of yesterday afternoon was oppressively <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">warm</span>—and this on
                the 8th of December! One of the papers wittily says the telegraph has brought on a

                Thursday night; I am informed it will yield $1400 or $1500 profit. The play and
                performances generally were well sustained.....Exhibitions of various kinds—pictures
                and other works of art among the rest—are now very well patronized in New York. The
                proprietors of nearly all these places are making money....It is every way likely
                the plan of the "Battery enlargement" will be favorably decided upon before long.
