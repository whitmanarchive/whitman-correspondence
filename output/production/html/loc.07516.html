                alone—Mrs D[avis] has gone to her room—I have had
                rather a bad day—uncomfortably <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">full</span> feeling &amp; two
                or three brief pronounced spells of pain &amp; dizziness in the head—but feel
                ab't as usual to-night—the things &amp; note came all right last evn'g from
                the Phila. druggist—best thanks— Eakin[s] is here
                to-day painting—weather fine here—Andrew Carnegie has sent me his books with friendly
                inscription—</p>

                buckwheat cakes &amp; chocolate—feel pretty well—Shall try to get out a
                little—out doors looks so attractive—no letters this morning—took
                some of the bitter water when I got out of bed—no letter has come here for you
                —Sh'd one come I will mail it to you St A[ugustine]—Did you see
                    O'C[onnor] at Wash'n?</p>
