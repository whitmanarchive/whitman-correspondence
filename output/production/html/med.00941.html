                    (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Pall Mall Gazette</span> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
                    what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
                    would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
                    investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
                    impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
                    "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
                    readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
                    headlines. He died on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Titanic</span> when it sank in

                    letter of <a href="loc.04335">December 10, 1890</a>, Whitman had sent him
                    proof of "Old Poets" from which Stead extracted in the Christmas issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Review of Reviews</span>. On <a href="loc.04337">February 16, 1891</a>, Stead forwarded the February issue, in which
                    Whitman's post card was reproduced in facsimile (3:163). The magazine printed
                    excerpts from Whitman articles in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's</span> in March
