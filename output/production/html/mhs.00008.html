            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">All goes satisfactory here—I keep as well as usual—have a very good room
                &amp; board in a kind of half hotel half boarding house, the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hotel Waterston</span>—the landlady Mrs Moffit, has a hundred
                guests when full, mostly families, very nice—capital table, (most too good for
                me, tempts me too much)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My book is getting on swimmingly—I have got it (after considerable worrying
                &amp; doing &amp; undoing) into a shape that suits me first-rate, and this
                printing office is putting it into typographical shape too that satisfies me
                well—nearly 100 pages already set up &amp; cast—so you see that's
                working all right—I am mostly

                here at the printing office, five or six hours
                every day, reading proof &amp; seeing to things—Mr
                Osgood the publisher &amp; Rand &amp; Avery the printers are very friendly indeed, I
                couldn't have better ones to deal with. I suppose you get the papers I
                send—the Boston <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Globe</span> of four or five days ago—&amp; others—I get my letters very well
                here, sent on from Camden—Lou I send a small package directed to you by mail,
                please put it up on my table—Shall send occasionally same way, to be put
                up there &amp; kept for me—I go out riding now &amp; then, am to go for a
                couple of hours this evening—havn't got anything from you since (I believe)
                Monday last.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Address me either <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">here</span> (see outside of this
                envelope)—or care Osgood &amp; Co: 211 Tremont Street—Of course the
                greatest anxiety about the President—thought here
                to-day there is no hope—it is terrible—</p>
