            <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>received</span>​  a magazine (the Galaxy) from you yesterday, which I
                have been peeping in a little to day, but the day has been so beautiful &amp; the
                charm of the open air so great that I could not long keep my eyes on the printed
                page. The season is at last fairly in for it, and the fruit trees are all getting in
                bloom. My bees are working like beavers &amp; there is a stream of golden thighs
                pouring into the hive all the time. I can do almost anything with them &amp; they
                wont sting me. Yesterday I turned a hive up &amp; pruned it, that is cut out a lot
                of old dirty comb; the little fellows were badly frightened &amp; came pouring out,
                in great consternation, but did not offer to sting me.

                going to transfer a swarm in a day or two to a new style of hive. I spend all my
                time at work about the place &amp; like it much. I run over to W. to look after bank
                matters for a day or two then back here. The house is being plastered &amp; will be
                finished during the summer. The wrens &amp; robins &amp; phoebe birds have already
                taken possession of various nooks of it, &amp; if they are allowed to go on with
                their building I must stop mine. During that snow storm the last of april the Hermit
                thrush took refuge in it. We are surrounded with birds here &amp; they are a great
                comfort &amp; delight to me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your room is ready for you &amp; your breakfast plate warmed. When will you come? I
                know the change would do you good &amp; your presence would certainly do us good. We
                are counting on your coming &amp; do not disappoint us. I will meet you in N.Y. if
                you will tell me when. Let us hear from you soon. Ursula sends
                love.</p>
