            <p class="tei_p">Your good letter came four days ago—Herb's has also reached me—both warmly appreciated &amp; thanked—I keep
                well—am still here in C. but shall go off somewhere soon—Dr Bucke's book
                will be first published in England—Josiah Child,
                (at Trübner's) will have some copies in a very few days, (to enter one at
                Stationers' Hall, London, to secure the English copyright: &amp; to make the
                first sales)—You will see your pen &amp; thought are in it—Herb's picture intaglio forms the
                frontispiece—Mrs Stafford is about as well as usual again. It is a very warm Sunday afternoon—as I write up
                in my third story south room—</p>
