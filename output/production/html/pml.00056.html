                    critical of Bucke's biography: she particularly objected to "carefully gathering
                    together again all the rubbish stupid or malevolent that has been written of
                    you" and to "all that unmeaning, irrelevant clatter about what Rabelais or
                    Shakespeare or the ancients &amp; their times tolerated in the way of coarseness
                    or plainness of speech." She also forwarded to Whitman her recent biography of
                    Mary Lamb (1883). She wrote again on <a href="loc.05153">October
                        13–21</a>. Apparently Whitman did not reply to either letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00056_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00056_n3"><span>The biography was
