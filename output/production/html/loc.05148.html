            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got your post card last Tuesday morning.<a href="#n1027" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1027">1</a> I had not written for
                some time because I waited till I had something to say about the essay on the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  I was preparing for delivery here. They had promised me an earlier date
                for it, but could not, in the end, find one till the 25th Sept. last, the day I got
                your card on. It (i.e. the lecture) was delivered before the Dresden Literary
                Society, consisting mostly of Professors &amp; savants of all kinds.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> No one knew anything, or anything beyond the name, of
                you, except Dr. Doehn, the author of a history of American Literature I told you
                    of.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> He spoke on my essay, and took the usual line of
                intelligent and book-learned persons, thus—"He is a poet by God's 
                grace—but that is all" (and it isn't much, according to Dr. D.) "He is wanting
                in two indispensable requisites for a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">great</span> writer. (1) Knowledge—(2) Form."
                As to the absence of knowledge, I can only conjecture that he meant that your poems
                would not be regarded as historical studies, like Schillers 'Tell' &amp;c. Two others
                spoke—one a Dr. Hohlfeld, a man of much genuine thoughtfulness. He merely
                pointed out some philosophical parallels between things I had said, and passages of
                Schiller &amp; Schleiermacher. A third speaker said a few words which showed that he
                understood my drift—among other things he said what I had reported about you
                reminded him of Wordsworth. Now this was really remarkable, for I had always held
                that Wordsworth was the true predecessor of the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  &amp; on asking Edward Dowden once about this, he fully
                confirmed what I had thought. ("Wordsworth is calculated to lead a courageous,
                though not a timid, person <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01042_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01042_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01042_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01042_large.jpg</span>

                had mentioned him.—Now it so happens that another English friend here has,
                about a year ago, delivered a lecture before the same Literary <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Society​ ">Soc.</span>​  on Wordsworth. And we mean now to publish both lectures together with a
                short preface showing in what direction the connection between you &amp; Wordsworth is
                to be looked for. I will send you some copies as soon as this appears, which will be
                without delay. As to my translation of the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  I am now ready to cooperate with any competent German, i.e. I have got a
                good way in the actual rendering, &amp; see how it is to be done, &amp;c. &amp; all I want
                is a colleague to push on the work energetically with. But nothing of the kind has
                as yet turned up (although intelligent &amp; more or less sympathetic readers in
                sufficient number.) Now do you know anyone whom you could put in connection with
                me? It does not strike me as needful that he should live in this town. We could
                easily arrange some system of work, through the post, &amp; meet if necessary some
                time? Perhaps my essay when published may lead to something. I got Dr. Bucke's
                    book.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a> He was kind enough to send me a copy (I hope
                my letter of acknowledgment did not fail to reach him). I think it will be of the
                greatest service for all time (giving permanent expression to facts of great
                interest &amp; importance, but the theoretic part of it not going deep enough.) I will
                send him my essay when it appears.</p>

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The
                    lecture was published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ueber Wordsworth und Walt

                    (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston gave a humorous account of the Dresden society in
                    "The Literarischer Verein of Augustusstadt," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Dublin
                        University Review</span>, 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
                    signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
                    criticism. Rolleston also commented on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
                    which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claimed that "Walt
                    Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
                    he was treated from a more exlusively philosophical point of view." After the
