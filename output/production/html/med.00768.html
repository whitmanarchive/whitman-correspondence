            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> Since the completion of my late work on "Nests &amp;
                Eggs of Birds of the U.S.," I have been engaged in preparing a book on bird-poetry.
                Would like to include your poem on "The Man-of-War Bird," if you have no objection.
                Anything else that you would like to appear, will be given a place, if you will call
                my attention thereto. Trusting to hear from you soon, </p>

                    (1843–1905) was an ornithologist from Philadelphia and had already
                    published six books by the time he got into contact with Whitman. It appears
                    that his turn to Whitman coincided with a growing alienation from his
                    profession. For more on Gentry, see Ed Folsom, "The Mystical Ornithologist and
                    the Iowa Tufthunter: Two Unpublished Whitman Letters and Some Identifications,"
