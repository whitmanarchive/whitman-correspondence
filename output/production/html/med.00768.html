            <p class="tei_p"> Since the completion of my late work on "Nests &amp;
                Eggs of Birds of the U.S.," I have been engaged in preparing a book on bird-poetry.
                Would like to include your poem on "The Man-of-War Bird," if you have no objection.
                Anything else that you would like to appear, will be given a place, if you will call
                my attention thereto. Trusting to hear from you soon, </p>
