                    <p class="tei_p">James S. Redfield, a publisher at 140 Fulton Street, New York, was a
                        distributor of Whitman's books in the early 1870s. On March 23, 1872,
                        Redfield accepted 496 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>: "I
                        am to account to him (for all that I may sell) at the rate of One Dollar
                        &amp; Fifty Cents a copy, (1.50)" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                        Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                        D.C.).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">When Whitman prepared his will on October 23, 1872, he noted that Redfield
                        had 500 copies of the fifth edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                            Grass</span>, 400 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">As a Strong Bird on Pinions
                            Free</span>, and 500 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span>
                        (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript,
                        and Special Collections Library). Redfield later established a London outlet
                        for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                            Grass</span> with Sampson, Low, Marston, Low, and Searle, who, on <a href="loc.01897">March 28, 1873</a>, transferred Redfield's account
                        for the remaining books to Whitman. On <a href="loc.01827">February 12,
                            1875</a>, when his firm was in bankruptcy, Redfield noted that the
                        balance due Whitman ($63.45) "will have to go in with my general
                        indebtedness. I think my estate will pay 50 cents on the dollar: hope so at
                        any rate." He suggested that Michael Doolady and the new Boston firm of
                        Estes and Lauriat might agree to handle his books; Doolady was the
                        bookseller and publisher mentioned in Whitman's <a href="duk.00649">October 13, 1867</a> letter to Dionysius Thomas and in Whitman's <a href="loc.01566">November 13, 1867</a> letter to Doolady. He printed
                        Ada Clare's 1866 book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Only a Woman's Heart</span>. He noted,
                        however, that most book dealers were unwilling to sell Whitman's books,
                        either because of inadequate sales or because of the poet's reputation in
                        respectable circles: "It is only here and there a speckled sheep, like J. S.
                        R., turns up who—not to put too fine a point upon it—don't care
                        a d--n for Mrs Grundy, who would take you in."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00408_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00408_n3"><span>The receipt, written by
