                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Boy,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your second letter yesterday—it is a real comfort to me to get such
                letters from you, dear friend. Every word does me good. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span> came all right, &amp; was quite interesting. I suppose you got my
                second letter last Wednesday. There is nothing new or special to write about
                to-day—still I thought I would send you a few lines, for Sunday. I put down
                off hand, &amp; write all about myself &amp; my doings, &amp;c. because I suppose
                that will be really what my dear comrade wants most to hear, while we are separated.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am doing a little literary work, according as I feel in the mood—composing on
                my books. I am having a small edition of the Leaves of Grass for 1867, fixed up
                &amp; printed. This &amp; some other things give me a little occupation. Upon the
                whole though I don't do much, but go around a great deal—eat my rations every
                time, sleep at night like a top, &amp; am having good times so far, in a quiet way,
                enjoying New York, the society of my mother, &amp; lots of friends. Among other
                things I spend a portion of the day, with the pilots of the ferry boats, sailing on
                the river. The river &amp; bay of New York &amp; Brooklyn are always a great
                attraction to me. It is a lively scene. At either tide, flood or ebb, the water is
                always rushing along as if in haste, &amp; the river is often crowded with steamers,
                ships &amp; small craft, moving in different directions, some coming in from sea,
                others going out. Among the pilots are some of my particular friends—when I
                see them up in the pilot house on my way to Brooklyn, I go up &amp; sail to &amp;
                fro several trips. I enjoy an hour or two's sail of this kind very much indeed. My mother
                &amp; folks are well, &amp; are engaged just these times in the delightful business
                of moving. I should assist, but have hired a substitute in the shape of a stout
                young laboring man.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I send you, by mail, a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the Broadway</span>, with the piece
                    in the same as I had in the car one day. It will not interest you
                much, only as something coming from me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think of you very often, dearest comrade, &amp; with more calmness than when I was
                there—I find it first rate to think of you, Pete, &amp; to know that you are
                there, all right, &amp; that I shall return, &amp; we will be together again. I
                don't know what I should do if I hadn't you to think of &amp; look forward to.
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tell Tom Hasset, on No. 7, that I wish to be remembered to him
                particular. Pete, I hope this will find you entirely well of your cold. I am glad to
                hear that your mother is all right of her cold. This is the time of year when they
                are apt to be pretty troublesome. I should like to have seen that match played
                between the Nat. &amp; Olympics.
