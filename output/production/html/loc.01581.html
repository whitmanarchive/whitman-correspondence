            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your second letter yesterday—it is a real comfort to me to get such
                letters from you, dear friend. Every word does me good. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span> came all right, &amp; was quite interesting. I suppose you got my
                second letter last Wednesday. There is nothing new or special to write about
                to-day—still I thought I would send you a few lines, for Sunday. I put down
                off hand, &amp; write all about myself &amp; my doings, &amp;c. because I suppose
                that will be really what my dear comrade wants most to hear, while we are separated.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am doing a little literary work, according as I feel in the mood—composing on
                my books. I am having a small edition of the Leaves of Grass for 1867, fixed up
                &amp; printed. This &amp; some other things give me a little occupation. Upon the
                whole though I don't do much, but go around a great deal—eat my rations every
                time, sleep at night like a top, &amp; am having good times so far, in a quiet way,
                enjoying New York, the society of my mother, &amp; lots of friends. Among other
                things I spend a portion of the day, with the pilots of the ferry boats, sailing on
                the river. The river &amp; bay of New York &amp; Brooklyn are always a great
                attraction to me. It is a lively scene. At either tide, flood or ebb, the water is
                always rushing along as if in haste, &amp; the river is often crowded with steamers,
                ships &amp; small craft, moving in different directions, some coming in from sea,
                others going out. Among the pilots are some of my particular friends—when I
                see them up in the pilot house on my way to Brooklyn, I go up &amp; sail to &amp;
                fro several trips. I enjoy an hour or two's sail of this kind very much indeed.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> My mother
                &amp; folks are well, &amp; are engaged just these times in the delightful business
                of moving. I should assist, but have hired a substitute in the shape of a stout
                young laboring man.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I send you, by mail, a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the Broadway</span>, with the piece
                    in<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> the same as I had in the car one day. It will not interest you
                much, only as something coming from me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think of you very often, dearest comrade, &amp; with more calmness than when I was
                there—I find it first rate to think of you, Pete, &amp; to know that you are
                there, all right, &amp; that I shall return, &amp; we will be together again. I
                don't know what I should do if I hadn't you to think of &amp; look forward to.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tell Tom Hasset,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> on No. 7, that I wish to be remembered to him
                particular. Pete, I hope this will find you entirely well of your cold. I am glad to
                hear that your mother is all right of her cold. This is the time of year when they
                are apt to be pretty troublesome. I should like to have seen that match played
                between the Nat. &amp; Olympics.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>

                    <p class="tei_p">These "papers" probably included the September 26, 1868, issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Weekly</span>, which contained some of Thomas

                        Theatrical Journal." The Sorrells were evidently brothers and drivers.
                        William Sydnor was described in an address book as "driver car boy on
                        Pittsburgh's car 7th st" (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman,
                        The Library of Congress, Notebook #108); Walt Whitman inquired about
                        Sydnor's health in his <a href="loc.01582">October 2 (?), 1868</a>
                        letter to Lewis Wraymond. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sporting Life</span> was a weekly

                    first letter. Doyle's letter of <a href="uva.00360">September 18, 1868</a>
