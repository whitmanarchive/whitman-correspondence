                day before yesterday as I was on my way to Sarnia. 
                I voted there on thursday morning (5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>)  
                and at noon returned to London and voted here. The elections are over 
                but we do not yet know the result with any accuracy—the government, however, is
                no doubt sustained (worse luck) and closer trade relations with you are indefinitely postponed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yes, I got the Lips' and like the pieces and the way they came out there much. 
                [—] I hope now not to be so crowded and to have more time to write and keep track of my american 
                affairs—I hope Horace and I shall get at the W. W. book of collect before a great while. 
                I trust you are tolerably comfortable. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">This</span>
                I suppose is the most we must hope for untill the spring opens and you get outside again</p>
