            <p class="tei_p">(Somehow the Mr does not come well before Walt Whitman). I am glad to hear from you 
                again &amp; to learn that at any rate you are no worse than when you last wrote, &amp; 
                that though your health be shattered<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> your good spirits 
                flourish up like a plant from broken ground, glad also that you find something to 
                approve of in a work so utterly unlike your own as my Queen Mary.<a href="#n0490" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0490">3</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am this morning starting with my wife &amp; 
                Sons<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> on a tour to the Continent. 
                She has been very unwell for two years, obliged always to lie down &amp; incapable 
                of any work in consequence of overwork—the case of so many in this age, yours 
                among others &amp; we are now going into a land of fuller sunshine in hopes that it 
                may benefit her.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am in an extreme hurry, packing up &amp; after these few words must bid you goodbye, 
                not without expressing my hope however that you will ultimately recover all your pristine 
                vigor. I shall be charmed to receive your book.</p>

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00439_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00439_n1"><span>This is a reply to the

                    Following her marriage to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, she served as a business
                    manager and secretary for her husband, in addition to taking on the
                    responsiblities of running large households. She was the mother of two sons,
                    Hallam (1852–1928) and Lionel Tennyson (1854–1886). She also wrote
                    hymns, set some of her husband's poetry to music, and assisted Hallam in writing
                    a memoir of her husband. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
