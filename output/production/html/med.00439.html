            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">(Somehow the Mr does not come well before Walt Whitman). I am glad to hear from you 
                again &amp; to learn that at any rate you are no worse than when you last wrote, &amp; 
                that though your health be shattered your good spirits 
                flourish up like a plant from broken ground, glad also that you find something to 
                approve of in a work so utterly unlike your own as my Queen Mary.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am this morning starting with my wife &amp; 
                Sons on a tour to the Continent. 
                She has been very unwell for two years, obliged always to lie down &amp; incapable 
                of any work in consequence of overworkâ€”the case of so many in this age, yours 
                among others &amp; we are now going into a land of fuller sunshine in hopes that it 
                may benefit her.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am in an extreme hurry, packing up &amp; after these few words must bid you goodbye, 
                not without expressing my hope however that you will ultimately recover all your pristine 
                vigor. I shall be charmed to receive your book.</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Ever yours</span>
