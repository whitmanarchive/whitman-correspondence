                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
