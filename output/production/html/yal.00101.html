            <p class="tei_p">I own the Stereotype plates of your Poem, "Leaves of Grass" I bought them of the assigness of Thayer &amp; Eldridge at the time of their failure. I should like to sell them &amp; did not know but you would like to purchase if you could get them at the right figure. I do not know what they cost, but my impression is, that it was somewhere in the neighborhood of $800. I would be pleased to have you state what you would give for them, or to know if you could refer me to any publisher who would be likely to purchase. I think you could make better arrangements with publishers if <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00101.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fyal.00101.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fyal.00101.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">yal.00101.002.jpg</span>you owned the Stereotype plates</p>
