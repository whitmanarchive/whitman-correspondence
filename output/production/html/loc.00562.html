         <p class="tei_p">Your favor is at hand.  Our<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> Mr. Thayer will be in New York tomorrow and call on you either Saturday or Sunday.  He will stop at the Astor.  We think favorably of the propositions in your letters, but owing to a press of other business next week we should not be able to give that personal attention to the matter which we should desire, and we have one or two other works in the stereotypes hands, which can be finished next week and which we should like to have out of the way before commencing on anything new.  We can make our arrangement, so that we shall be comparatively untrammeled week after next, and if agreeable to you should like to have you defer your visit until then.  The form and style of the Poems is a matter only to be decided on after a free and full personal conference, discussing the whole thing thoroughly</p>
