                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still holding on about the same—it is pretty certain I don't get behindhand, 
                &amp; that's about the best I can say—continue to get out a little every day 
                when the weather will permit—but my walking power is still very bad indeed—Pete I sent the shirts this morning by Adams express—they are enveloped 
                in a flat paper box about 2 feet long by 1 wide—I hope they will get there Saturday—(but possibly may not reach you till Monday)—(You must pay the freight there)—I hope they will fit—the blue one (it wasn't done till last night) is to wear over—I got the stuff, it is first rate Middlesex flannel, cost $5, (same as my summer 
                suits are made of,)—is not intended to be washed often—but can be when necessary—must then be washed by some one experienced in washing nice flannels—I sent Graphic with my portrait—(as they sent me some)—also my Capitol letter—I rec'd your good letter last Tuesday</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01625.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01625.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01625.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear son, I send you $10 for your Christmas present—perhaps you will need a pair 
                of winter boots, (or some good cotton flannel for underclothes—or something)—I rec'd a good letter from Mr. Eldridge—Mrs. O'Connor was to come home last Tuesday—I sent a paper to Parker Milburn with my portrait—also to Charley Towner—I hope you carried yours up to Mr. Nash, as I know it would interest &amp; amuse him 
                &amp; Mrs. Nash—give them both my love—(I see just a line in the paper that Mr. Nash 
                had given some reminiscences at a meeting of the Oldest Inhabitants.)—I see the B &amp; P. RR. had a bad freight car accident last Wednesday night 
                at Patapsco, but no injury to human life or limb—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I have not been quite so well in the head yesterday &amp; to-day—but am around as usual, 
                as it is nothing very heavy—We are having a mild spell here, this is the third day, 
                with partial rain &amp; fog—It is now just after 1—I am sitting here writing this in 
                the parlor by the heater—my dinner is about ready, &amp; I am going—Every thing is very complete 
                &amp; correct here—but O I need your dear loving face &amp; hand &amp; voice—</p>
