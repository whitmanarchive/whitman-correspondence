            <p class="tei_p">Dear Sir, Oliver W. Holmes kindly wrote for me his poem, "The Last Leaf"; and Tennyson wrote for me the first verse of his 
                beautiful "Break Break Break." Would you kindly do likewise. How I would treasure a poem from "the good gray poet."</p>

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
                    Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
                    volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>
                    (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"

                    (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
                    Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
                    Burroughs. Holmes remained ambivalent about Whitman's poetry. He married Amelia
                    Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later Supreme
                    Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see Julie A.

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson, 
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> [New York: F. P.
                    Harper, 1896], 223). Tennyson's first letter to Whitman is dated <a href="med.00410">July
                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.04937_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.04937_n2"><span>The remainder of this letter
