                    (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
                    Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
                    Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
                    Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man . . .
                    never satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>). Aldrich visited Whitman at his Camden home
                    numerous times, and he served as a conduit between the poet and William Michael
                    Rossetti in England, who edited the first British edition of Whitman's work. For
