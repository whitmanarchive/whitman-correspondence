            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letters of the 6th &amp; 7 have arrived, with timely contributions from D. L. Northrup,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> John H. Rhodes,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">3</a> Thos.

With these, as with other funds, I aid all I can soldiers from all the states. Most heartily do I thank you, dear friend, for your kind exertions—&amp; those gentlemen above named—it is a work of God's charity, never cases more deserving of aid, never more heart-rending cases, than these now coming up in one long bloody string from Chancellorsville and Fredericksburgh battles, six or seven hundred every day without intermission. We have already over 3000 arrived here in hospital from Hooker's late battles. I work somewhere among them every day or in the evening. It is not so exhausting as one might think—the endurance &amp; spirit are supplied. My health, thank God, was never better—I feel strong &amp; elastic—an obstinate cold &amp; deafness some weeks, seems to be broken up at last. Yesterday I spent nearly all day at Armory Square Hospital. This forenoon I take an intermission, &amp; go again at dusk.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">You there north must not be so disheartened about Hooker's return to this side of the Rappahannock and supposed failure.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> The blow struck at Lee &amp; the rebel sway in Virginia, &amp; generally at Richmond &amp; Jeff Davis, by this short but tremendous little campaign, of 2d, 3d, 4th &amp; 5th inst's, is in my judgment the heaviest and most staggering they have yet got from us, &amp; has not only hit them nearer where they live than all Maclellan ever did, but all that has been levelled at Richmond during the war. I mean this deliberately. We have I know paid for it <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00769.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00769.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00769.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.00769.002.jpg</span><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00769.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00769.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00769.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.00769.003.jpg</span>with thousands of dear noble lives, America's choicest blood, yet the late battles are not without something decisive to show for them. Hooker will resume operations forthwith—may be has resumed them. Do not be discouraged. I am not even here—here amid all this huge mess of traitors, loafers, hospitals, axe-grinders, &amp; incompetencies &amp; officials that goes by the name of Washington.

                        <a href="wwh.00004">January 16, 1863</a>
                    . Moses Lane
                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27, 1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an
                    unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
                    Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
                    quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
                    Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
                    there.)" Lane assisted Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from
                        <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00769_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00769_n1"><span>Daniel L. Northrup was a

                    west, dying in Alameda, California, on January 14, 1887. Thanks to Walter Stahr
