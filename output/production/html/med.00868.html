            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed was brought this morning by the carrier. Suppose you received some
                copies of the "Grashalme," as I did from Rolleston.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am still laid up here by disablement and paralysis—am confined entirely to my
                room and mostly to my chair. I received your acknowledgment of the big book
                "Complete Works."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dr. Bucke is well—hard at work managing the big Insane
                Asylum at London, Ontario, Canada. My dear friend O'Connor is
                very ill at Washington. Am sitting here in big arm chair (with great wolf skin
                spread back) as I write—raw dark day—keep up pretty good spirits.</p>
