                with it at his office &amp; giving it to him. I read it to him first—in a sort of casual way—&amp; when I
                came to the words "Give this scrawl to Wentworth Dixon to keep if he cares for it" it was notable how his face &amp;
                neck flushed deep red with pleasure. It was a rare joy to me as well as to him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">No gift could possibly have been better, &amp; I know well he will treasure it as long as he lives.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Quiet, cool &amp; undemonstrative—no man in Bolton is more true &amp; genuine. A model husband &amp; father, he

                Uncompromising in his reverence for truth alone, he quietly puts aside all that is doubtful or undemonstrable, 
                &amp; takes his stand on what is verifiable only.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Leaving the orthodoxy in which he was brought up, he became an agnostic. Then, to his deep delight,

                &amp; sincere, whom he could with a whole heart reverence &amp; love.
                He studied their books closely and with genuine enthusiasm. I have heard nothing better than two papers on 
                Epictetus he once read to our little "College"<a href="#n2b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2b">7</a>—himself a worthy representative of the noble old Roman.—

                He has long since learned to love &amp; honour you as a man. 
                I can see that he does this increasingly, with keener desire to understand your words, &amp; a nearer approach to

                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February

                    teachings of Stoicism is the concept that one must overcome destructive emotions
                    through self-control. Prominent Stoics included Marcus Aurelius, Seneca, and

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
