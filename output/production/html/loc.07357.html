            <p class="tei_p">And in the first place I may say that I received by mail from England nearly a week
                ago J.A. Symonds' "Essays: Speculative &amp; Suggestive," that I have, of course, found time to read "Democratic
                Art," and that I am greatly disappointed.
                It, to my mind, comes far short of what
                such a man ought to have written on such a subject. The singular thing to me is that
                he does not seem to understand the least what you are driving at, what you are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">there for</span>. He speaks for instance of "Walt Whitman whose

            <p class="tei_p">Is it not extraordinary that he should not see through and behind this (perfectly
                true as far as it goes) phase of the matter?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How strange too (to cite a small but significant point) that he does not know that
                the "Poetry of the Future" is included in "Sp. Days &amp; Collect"?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The whole article is "flat, stale and unprofitable"—a saw dust chewing
                business–dealing with the hull, the shell, the superfices, never for one time,
                one flash of insight penetrating to the heart of the business. Too bad, too bad.</p>

                    "Rejoinder" you mention. Will you not send it? Or do
                you mean the reply to the Woodberry shirt sleeve lie? I
                have that &amp; Kennedy's letter. I hope you will find
                Symonds' letter &amp; send it, am particularly anxious
                to read it now and compare it with his "Democratic Art" (it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">may
