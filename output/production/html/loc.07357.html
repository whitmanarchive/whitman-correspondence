                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    from Symonds. In the letter, Symonds asks Whitman to clarify the meaning of the
                    "Calamus" poems and whether or not Whitman intended them to include physical and
                    emotional intimacies between men. Whitman probably responded on <a href="loc.02142">August 19, 1890</a>, though only a draft of the poet's
                    letter survives. In this draft letter, Whitman denies having intended any
                    homoerotic meanings for the "Calamus" poems and boasts that he had fathered six
                    illegitimate children, a claim that is certainly false. The letter referred to
                    here may also be an older one; Whitman also promised to pass along "an older
                    letter" from Symonds in his <a href="loc.07831">August 24, 1890</a>,
                    letter to Bucke. The older letter would probably be Symonds' passionate letter
                    of <a href="loc.04191">December 9, 1889</a>, which prefigured Symonds'
                    August 3rd letter. Whitman mentioned this older letter in his <a href="loc.07741">December 25–26, 1889</a> letter to Bucke. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
