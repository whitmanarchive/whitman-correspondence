            <p class="tei_p">Much disappointed the last two days at not getting word f'm you. Pray this may find
                you comfortable. Nothing new or different with me—have had bad ten days, head,
                stomach, &amp;c—Suspicion however of slight lull to-day—Some good words
                of me in big printed quarters (such as N Y <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>, &amp;c)—Sit here in big chair ab't
                same—Love to you and N[elly]—</p>
