            <p class="tei_p">I send you today a London paper with a sample of the controversy that has been going on here for some time about "Leaves of Grass,"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> I think it is quite likely that a few copies could now be sold in this neighbourhood. I have seen <span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">a</span> bookseller about it and I am going to propose a plan to you. It is this: I.I. Anderson &amp; Co. <span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">will</span> keep "Leaves of Grass" and advertise it with their ordinary book-list and they will have 10 p.c. i.e. 50¢ a <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  for selling it—I will hand over to them the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volumes​ ">vols.</span>​  that are on the way now and they will get others from you as they need them—You will always notify me when you send them books &amp; the number of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volumes​ ">vols.</span>​  sent—I will be responsible to you for the books sent them and will collect the money derived from

            <p class="tei_p">There is another matter: the tariff on books has lately been altered it is now 15 p.c. this would be 75¢ a <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  on your books—in making out your invoices your proper plan is to put the books in at $5.00 per <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  and allow 40 p.c. discount off—this is about the usual discount to the trade—this will make the duty 45 cents a <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  So that I should be able to send you $4.05 for each <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">vol.</span>​  sold.—Please let me know at once if this plan meets your approval</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Many of my friends have an extraordinary curiosity to see you and I hope that you will gratify it by paying us your promised visit this summer—Mrs Bucke and the children are almost as anxious as I am that you should come—</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Whitman was delivered in London on February 27, 1880, and was reported in detail
                    in the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Advertiser</span> on February 28, 1880. This
                    report provoked letters of protest in both the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Advertiser</span>
                    and the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Free Press</span>. Bucke may have sent Whitman a
                    copy of the March 12, 1880 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Advertiser</span> in which Bucke is
                    charged with "dig[ging] up from the gutter a book stained with filth." (See
