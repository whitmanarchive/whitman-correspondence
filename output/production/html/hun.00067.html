                <span class="tei_salute">To Messrs: Griffin Martinez Prince, and other gentlemen at Santa
                Fe—</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sirs:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your kind invitation to visit you and deliver a poem for the 333d Anniversary of Founding Santa Fe has reached me so late, that I have to
                decline, with sincere regret.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> But I will say a few words
                off-hand.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We Americans have yet to really learn our own antecedents, and sort them, to unify
                them. They will be found ampler than has been supposed and in widely different
                sources. Thus far, impressed by New England writers and schoolmasters, we
                tacitly abandon ourselves to the notion that our United States have been fashioned
                from the British Islands only, and essentially form a second England
                only—which is a great mistake. Many leading traits for our future national
                personality, and some of the best ones, will certainly prove to have
                originated from other than British stock. As it is, the British and German, valuable
                as they are in the concrete, already threaten excess. Or rather, I should say, they
                have certainly <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="reached​ ">reach'd</span>​  that excess. To-day, something outside of them, and to
                counterbalance them, is seriously needed.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Thus seething materialistic and business vortices of the United States, in their
                present devouring relations, controlling and belittling everything else, are, in my
                opinion, but a vast and indispensable stage in the new world's development, and are
                certainly to be <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="followed​ ">follow'd</span>​  by something entirely different—at least by immense modifications.
                Character, literature, a society worthy the name, are yet to be <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="established​ ">establish'd</span>​ , through a nationality of noblest spiritual, heroic and democratic
                attributes—not one of which at present definitely exists—entirely
                different from the past, though unerringly founded on it, and to justify it.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">To that composite American identity of the future, Spanish character will supply some
                of the most needed parts. No stock shows a grander historic
                retrospect—grander in religiousness and loyalty, or for patriotism,
                courage, decorum, gravity and honor. (It is time to dismiss utterly the
                illusion-compound, half raw-head-and-bloody-bones and
                half Mysteries-of-Udolpho, inherited from the English writers of the
                past 200 years. It is time to realize—for it is certainly true—that
                there will not be found any more cruelty, tryanny, superstition, &amp;c., in the
                résumé of past Spanish history than in the corresponding résumé
                of Anglo-Norman history. Nay, I think there will not be found so
                much.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Then another point, relating to American ethnology, past and to come, I will here
                touch upon at a venture. As to our aboriginal or Indian population—the Aztec
                in the South, and many a tribe in the North and West—I know it seems to be
                agreed that they must gradually dwindle as time rolls on, and in a few
                generations more leave only a reminiscence, a blank. But I am not at all
                clear about that. As America, from its many far-back sources and current
                supplies, develops, adapts, entwines, faithfully identifies its own—are
                we to see it cheerfully accepting and using all the contributions of foreign lands
                from the whole outside globe—and then rejecting the only ones
                distinctively its own—the autochthonic ones?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">As to the Spanish stock of our Southwest, it is certain to me that we do not begin to
                appreciate the splendor and sterling value of its race element. Who knows but that
                element, like the course of some subterranean river, dipping invisibly for a hundred
                or two years, is now to emerge in broadest flow and permanent action?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If I might assume to do so, I would like to send you the most cordial,
                heart-felt congratulations of your American fellow-countrymen here. You
                have more friends in the Northern and Atlantic regions than you suppose, and they
                are deeply interested in development of the great Southwestern interior, and in what
                your festival would arouse to public attention.</p>

                    5, 1883, with the following headnote: "Our friends at Santa Fé, New Mexico,

                    their city by the Spanish. The good, gray Walt Whitman was asked to write them a
                    poem in commemoration. Instead he wrote them a letter as follows." The letter
                    from Arthur Boyle, requesting a poem for the "Santa Fé Tertio Millennial
                    Celebration," is in the Feinberg collection. Whitman's letter appears in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> as "The Spanish Element in Our
