                    "Jennie Wrenn," is currently unknown. A character known as Jennie Wren is
                    referred to as the "doll's dressmaker" in Charles Dickens's 1864 novel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Our Mutual Friend</span>, and an 1891 interview with the editor
                    of the magazine <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Doll's Dressmaker</span> confirms that
                    'Jennie Wren' is a pseudonym. When the interviewer then suggests a popular rumor
                    that her identity is Miriam Leslie, wife and successor of newspaper mogul Frank
                    Leslie, the editor replies that she does not know Leslie, and that she
                    "commenced the magazine because of a decreased income, and combined with the
                    work an object, viz.: to help poor little girls." There is also a "Jennie Wren"
                    listed in New York City directories in 1891, 1892, and 1894, living at the same
                    East 77th Street address given for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Doll's Dressmaker</span>,
                    but Wren does not appear in the directory after the magazine ceased publication.
