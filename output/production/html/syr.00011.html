Speaking about you he says 'I have for some time been seriously thinking of writing to him to express my love &amp; reverence'. He also says 'Do send me a photograph of him. I know of no means of getting it. I want if possible also a big one that I could frame &amp; hang up'. I have sent him one of the small photographs that I

Could you not put, instead, the head of 1871, or that of 1872 (which I admire much)? I have been showing the photographs you gave me to my sister Dora—whose likeness you have.
