                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    critic, had lauded Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Broadway Annual</span> in
                    1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
                    to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
                    See Harold Blodgett, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman in England</span> (1934),

                    (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
                    attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
