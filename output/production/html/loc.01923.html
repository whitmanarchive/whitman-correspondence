                    for J. M. Bradstreet &amp; Son, had supervised the binding of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> (see Whitman's <a href="rut.00002">May 2, 1865</a>,
                    letter to Peter Eckler). Simpson wrote on <a href="loc.01924">May 10,
                        1867</a>, that he was going into business for himself and was interested
                    in publishing Whitman's next book: "Hearing you are writing another book [I]
                    would like to print and publish it for you and will give you better advantages
                    than any other publishing house . . . One of my reasons for securing your
                    friendship is my appreciation for you as a man, well knowing your life has been
                    devoted to help along those most in need of your assistance." On <a href="loc.01925">May 31, 1867</a>, Simpson informed Whitman that "we
                    have established a Ptng &amp; Publishing House." But, in his <a href="loc.01926">July 3, 1867</a>, letter, he advised Whitman that after
                    consultation "with several eminent literary men . . . though we are favorably
                    impressed, . . . we deem it injudicious to commit ourselves to its publication
                    at the present time." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01923_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01923_n1"><span> "E pur si muove" is an
                    Italian phrase meaning "And yet it moves" or Although it does move." Often
                    attributed to the Italian physicist and mathematician Galileo Galilei
                    (1564”1642), the phrase means that, although Galilei was forced to recant
                    his claims that the Earth moved around the Sun, the Earth continues to do so
                    regardless of any contrary claims by the Church, for example. This letter is

                    (1828–1900), F. S. Hoffman, and "Abe" Simpson joined with B. W. Bond (of
                    the publishing firm Moorhead, Simpson &amp; Bond) to form the Agathynian Club,
                    which printed both original works and reprints with an interest in typographical
                    innovation. The Club produced periodicals, as well as reprints of rare, curious,
                    and old American, English, French, and Latin books (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American

                    the Bradstreet book-bindery, all 150 copies of the Club's second volume, and by
                    extension the Club itself, which folded in 1868 when Hammond elected to focus on
                    his medical practice. For more information on the Club, see Adolf Growell, "The
