                extend to you a little information and advice.—I am but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">two

                as you are said to have.—I was taken down at my farm in Westchester County
                near Pleasantville station on the Harlem road. And my doctor was Doct Swift<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> of that
                place. He brought me through, refusing to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">permit any cupping as
                    was done in Florences<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">3</a> case</span>; but taking <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good care, that during

                gave me a jacket over my shirt, to protect from cold, as I thrashed about. The
                jacket was a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">linen</span> one with sleeves. so that I should not
                feel the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">heat</span> of one.—Now, after a short time, (only
                a few hours,) from my left lung, (the one worst affected,) I began to throw off a
                green mucus.—This continued for days.—My <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">breath</span> 
                came &amp; went with a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rattle</span>. but this
                he assured me would disappear, as it finally did.—My doctor insisted <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I would live.</span>—others said <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">no. I
                    could not.</span>—He also gave my nurse each night instructions that at the
                end of each 2 hours, I should take a milk punch of Jamaica rum, milk &amp;
                sugar,—a wine glass full.—And daytime I should take 2 or 3 as I needed
                or felt inclined.—He gave me then <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sauce</span> to eat. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02507_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02507_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02507_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.02507_large.jpg</span> such as

                but my strength is daily improving.—I believe you can recover

                    1830–1898) was born in Steuben County, New York, and moved to Brooklyn in
                    1853. In 1856, he was one of three assemblymen to represent King's County in the
                    New York State Legislature and the only assemblyman from Brooklyn elected as a
                    member of the American Party, another name for the popular anti-Catholic,
                    anti-immigrant, far-right "Know Nothing" movement. In 1858, Wood was appointed
                    as Collector of Internal Revenue for Brooklyn's third district. After moving to
                    Manhattan in 1874, Wood practiced law and was Corporation Counsel in 1885 for
                    "Acting Mayor" William P. Kirk, a position he held for twelve hours. Wood's
                    appointment was contested by Emile Henry Lacombe, who was named Corporation
                    Counsel by outgoing mayor Franklin Edson before Kirk, as President of the Board
                    of Aldermen, assumed the role of Acting Mayor before the installation of the
                    incoming William Russell Grace. Arguing that the Acting Mayor does not have
                    authority to grant political appointments, Mayor Grace overturned Kirk's
                    appointment of Wood. For more information on Wood, see his obituary, "Death List
                    of a Day," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New York Times</span> (September 4, 1898), 7. For
