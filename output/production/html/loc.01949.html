                there is where George is staying. since Papa saw him, he has had very sore feet and
                legs, so bad that he could not have worked, even if he had had it. they were
                considerable better when I was there. I got there about 10 o'clock, and took dinner
                with him, then we went down to Fulton Ferry, with Nick Speer,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> a 5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> Ave. driver, and a great
