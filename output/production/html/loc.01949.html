            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter by Monday <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">evenings​ </span><span class="tei_corr">evening's​
        
      </span></span> mail.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I did not expect to hear from you so soon after writing nevertheless, I was just as
                glad to hear from you, I wrote in my last letter that we knew nothing about uncle
                    George. well, shortly after I had written to you we
                received a letter from him. this was on Friday night, and on the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">preceeding​ </span><span class="tei_corr">preceding​

                so, if you will do <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span>, as well as me, the favor of
                writing to him, you will please both of us, direct to No. 35 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="West​ ">W.</span>​  43 St. I suppose you know Arthur Henry. well, he is
                keeping the place near the 5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> Ave. Stage Stables, and
                there is where George is staying. since Papa saw him, he has had very sore feet and
                legs, so bad that he could not have worked, even if he had had it. they were
                considerable better when I was there. I got there about 10 o'clock, and took dinner
                with him, then we went down to Fulton Ferry, with Nick Speer, a 5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> Ave. driver, and a great
                friend of Uncle George. I guess you dont know Speer, he belongs in Paterson.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">well, we went to Fulton Ferry, and I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">was</span> to take boat from
                Peck's ship to go out on <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Long Island​ ">L. I.</span>​  but, the boat was not running, so I crossed from James's ship to Hunter's <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Island​ ">Is.</span>​  and took the cars from there to Great Neck. I have a cousin living there
                whom I went to visit. I left Uncle George at James' Ship. I suppose you have read
                all about the new P.O. in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N.Y.</span>​  It is a splendid building and is nearly finished. The Astor house has sold
                out its old Furniture and everything, and the building itself is undergoing repair

                be getting on very fast I believe the piers are not quite finished. I suppose you
                have heard that several of convicts have escaped from Blackwells, and Boss Tweed is to be released. Dan Bryant died, a week
                ago last Saturday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The weather here, is remarkably cold for the time of year, it freezes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hard</span> every night. April 16<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>,
                there fell 11 inches of snow and people rode with the sleigh, there are no gardens
                made yet, but I have plants in my hot bed big enough to be transplanted. Papa wrenched his back last Thursday, and has been laid up
                ever since.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am not much of a young man yet, I am 17 years old, all but a few days, but very
