            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your two post cards of March 8<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> &amp; March 10<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> addressed to Dr.
                    Johnston were received together yesterday—along with
                one from Warry.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We were very pleased to receive them &amp; to compare them, so as to arrive at a fair
                idea of your condition. We were very glad to note in the later one (March 10th) that
                there was "a suspicion of shade of betterment" in your <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01130.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01130.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01130.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> condition. We hope that the improvement
                is now more pronounced, as Traubel was "quite convinced" it
                would be, &amp; look for a better report when the weather improves.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It affects us very deeply that, in the midst of your weakness &amp; suffering, &amp;
                your other correspondence &amp; writing, you are so constantly mindful of us, &amp;
                so kind in writing to us.—What <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">can</span> we say in return?
                but that our deepest gratitude &amp; our heart's best love &amp; sympathy are with
                you always.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I wish that we could <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">shew​ </span><span class="tei_corr">show​
        
      </span></span> them better than by mere letter writing, &amp; by sending such papers
                &amp; magazines as are likely to interest you. But since even these please you, we
                shall continue to send them, as poor tokens of our deepest affection.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have not only cause for gratitude to you for all that your books have done for
                us,—&amp; will continue to do for us as we more deeply explore them, &amp;
                assimilate their teaching &amp; spirit—&amp; for the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01132.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01132.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01132.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> glad wonderful gift of your personal
                affection &amp; constant, ever-thoughtful kindness, (so deeply enhancing the
                personal appeal of your books too), but for the warm &amp; ever widening comradeship
                &amp; affection which comes to us through your influence. Love &amp; gratitude to
                you evermore.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Surely this "ever widening commune of brothers &amp; lovers" is destined to develop to unprecedented extents.
                Wherever the songs of Burns are sung Scotchmen meet together as brothers, in a
                common spirit of patriotism.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But when <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> influence &amp; fame reach their height, not
                Americans only, but your readers in every country will feel themselves linked
                together in a common bond &amp; a common love.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But, outside this acknowledged brotherhood, your influence will permeate further
                still;—as in small beginnings it does now. For in our daily lives it makes
                itself felt in all our dealings with others. Johnston feels it in his professional
                work, &amp; I, too, in mine. Brought daily into contact with numbers <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01134.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01134.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01134.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> of others, we learn to
                regard them more &amp; more in your own spirit,—&amp; are ourselves happier
                thereby.</p> 
            <span class="milestone undeclared tei_milestone tei_milestone_unit_undeclared tei_milestone_rend_horbar-short-center"> </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to learn that you "are getting on fairly with proofs of 2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nd</span> Annex," &amp; can understand how 
                relieved you will be when you get it fairly out of your hands. And to us its interest will be very great
                indeed.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I turn again &amp; again, with inexhaustible interest &amp; delight, to the wonderful
                preface to your first edition, (illustrating &amp; harmonizing so well, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01135.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01135.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01135.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> in every word, with all
                your after performance.) And I cannot but look forward with tender swelling joy
                &amp; pride &amp; love to your latest confirmation of the "message from the heavens"
                of which you have been the mouthpiece—"nor once losing nor faith nor ecstacy
                in Him."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">From the poems which have already appeared, (as in Lippincott's) I quite believe
                Traubel's words (in a letter to me) that they will <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01136.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01136.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01136.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> detract nothing from previous years &amp;
                work," but will <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">add</span> to them, &amp; that the book "is
                saturated with divine flavors."—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I must close. I intended to write to Traubel by this mail, but will ask you to
                convey my affectionate regards to him instead.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I expect Johnston &amp; Fred Wild here tomorrow afternoon (Sat.
                4) if the weather is favourable. In that case Johnston will post this for me on his
                return to Bolton (Post from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">here</span> tomorrow night too late
                for mail).</p>
