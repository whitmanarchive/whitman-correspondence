                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    as Scotland's national poet. An early Romantic poet who wrote in both Scots and
                    English (often though not exclusively inflected by Scottish dialect), Burns is
                    perhaps best known for his poems "Auld Lang Syne," "Tam o' Shanter" and "To a
                    Mouse" (from which the title of John Steinbeck's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Of Mice and
                        Men</span> is derived). Of Burns, Whitman wrote in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
                        Boughs</span>: "Though so much is to be said in the way of fault-finding,

                    dearest flesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone

                    politics and working-class ideals were often informed by Whitman's work. A
