                    Cattell, a young farm hand and a friend of the Staffords. The poet took an
                    interest in the Cattell family: "about 25 or 6—folks mother, father
                    &amp;c. live at Gloucester—his grand, or great grandfather, Jonas Cattell,
                    a great runner, &amp; Revolutionary soldier, spy." Whitman referred to Jonas in
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Times</span> on January 26, 1879. Whitman took
                    special interest, however, in Edward, as charged entries from one of his diaries
                    make clear: "the hour (night, June 19, '76, Ed &amp; I.) at the front gate by
                    the road." Two days later he noted "the swim of the boys, Ed. [Stafford?], Ed.
                    C. &amp; Harry" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Diary Notes</span> in Charles E. Feinberg

                    family of Harry Lamb Stafford (1858–1918), a young man who Whitman
                    befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents, George (1827–1892) and
                    Susan Stafford (1833–1910), were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
                    Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. In the
                    1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more on

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
