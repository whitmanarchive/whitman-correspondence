            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here in my room again writing to you—there is no particular change 
                in the situation—we are having some pretty cold weather here—I go out a little 
                every day, but my walking does not improve any—I had a partially bad spell 
                yesterday afternoon, &amp; did not go out, but it passed over, &amp; to-day I feel 
                as well as I usually have lately—I shall get out this afternoon, &amp; over to the 
                Reading room in Philadelphia—(Looking over the papers, I see occasionally very 
                interesting <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">news</span>, about myself—a paper in Salt Lake, Utah, had me dead,—&amp; the Philadelphia <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Item</span>, about the same time, had me at a public dinner, 
                in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil.</span>​  making a speech.) I rec'd your last. I suppose you got mine last Tuesday—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I have just had my dinner, bean soup, boiled beef, &amp; pumpkin-pie, all good—so you see I might be doing worse—it is now just after 2, &amp; I am feeling 
                quite comfortable—&amp; hope this will find you all right, my loving boy—</p>

    <div class="editorial_notes"><hr/><p><em>Correspondent:</em><br/><span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0752 note" id="n0752"><span>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
