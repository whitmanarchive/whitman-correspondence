            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have sent you a small Box of Books carriage Paid to your address in Washington. I
                expect it will leave Liverpool on Wednesday the 13th so I expect you will have it
                very soon after the arrival of this letter. I regret I could not send you some
                Indian Books I had in view when I wrote you some time ago. I mean the Bhagavad
                Gita—and the Vedas. the last is a work at present only published for the
                Scholars and Students it is in <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_br">8</span> large octavo volumes.—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01448.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01448.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01448.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and will not all be published this year.
                However the Collection is a representative one as you will find on looking over the
                list. I have few of them so relating to our modren Literature as you will observe they are by men whom I highly esteem though
                I do not endorse or hold by all they teach two of the Books are connected with my
                own thoughts and Studies. Time &amp; Tide and the progress of the Working Classes
                from 1832 to 1868, compiled by two warm advocates of the working Classes. the memoir
                of Bewick is also a work I love and esteem and one that i think will be <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01448.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01448.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01448.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> read by you with
                pleasure and also delight, as the utterances of a real noble honest soul, free from
                all pretensions of culture or Book-making, a truly representative Man, and lover of
                Nature, and natural Life. it is a Book I would fain see more known here and in
                America, it is so brimful of good sound sense. There is also a Portrait of Dante
                &amp; Milton both photographed by admirers of your works, and reading Pamphelets by <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_5">[illegible]</span> other warm admirers of your Book, and lastly
                there is 2 remarkable Indian Pamphelets Jesus Christ Europe &amp; Asia by Chunder Sen, an Hindoo—and one on Beneficent Government also written by an Hindoo Philosopher</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Also 4 numbers of the Cooperator containing L. Napoleon's remarkable work the
                Extinction of Pauperism to me a very remarkable production despite his none fullfilment of it now
                that he is in power and position—The last I will name is the Dabistan a very
                remarkable Book by a Persian on the Schools of Religion in the East a Book after
                your own heart I think one that will be dear to you indeed, or I am much mistaken in
                your love of Books, interspersed with fine stanzas of oriental Poetry, altogether in
                my opinion a real Book. and then the Sacconitala &amp; Indian Drama—the Flowery Scrawl, a Chinese Novel. These few
                fragments I hope will help to lift the Veil of the East to thee.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">P.S.<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> In Emerson's new Book Society and Solitude, the Essay upon Books makes
                    references to several oriental Books. I hope that notice of them will promote
                    their publication by some Publisher or else some Society will be formed to do
                    it. people who are lovers of the Writings of Emerson &amp; Mazzini ought to take
                    the matter in hand and do it effectually. then we would possess the necessary
                    works for a proper study of Humanity in all ages and in all Countries.</p>
