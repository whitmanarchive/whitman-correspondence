                    (1851–1903) was a well-known celebrity photographer who had taken
                    photographs of Whitman when the poet was in New York to give his lecture on Abraham Lincoln (his Lincoln lecture)
                    in April 1887. "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/zzz.00105.html">The Laughing
                        Philosopher</a>," one of the most famous photographs of Whitman, was taken

                    selling signed copies of his photographs of Walt Whitman. However, when the
                    September 1887 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> appeared with an
                    advertisement, Whitman still had not seen proofs, much less signed the
                    photographs. He wrote John H. Johnston on <a href="sal.00004">September 1,
                        1887</a>, "He advertises...to sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is
                    forged, &amp; the former illegal &amp; unauthorized." The disagreement was
                    quickly resolved, and Walt Whitman signed photographs for Cox and returned them
