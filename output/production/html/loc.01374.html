                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Thy welcome card came just as we were leaving London
                last week, after a very sad week with my cousin Saidee, whom thee may remember. She
                has been living for the last year &amp; a half in Berlin, her husband being
                correspondent for the N.Y. Herald, &amp; a few weeks ago the summons came for him to
                go back to New York. So they planned to stop in London for a couple of weeks on
                their way home, do their necessary shopping &amp; say their goodbyes to all of us.
                    Frank &amp; I were in Scotland when we first heard of this
                plan, &amp; we hastened to come down &amp; meet them, full of all kinds of joyful
                anticipations. Saidee &amp; I were most eager to compare, the great rivals, her
                little boy a year &amp; a half old, &amp; Ray almost the same age.
                Besides little Charley, Saidee had another baby to show me, a dear little creature
                only a month old. Mother &amp; father lent their house—No. 44—to
                them for their London stay, so that we were close together. When we arrived from
                Scotland, however, we found everything in confusion. The journey had been too much
                for them all: Saidee was ill in bed, both babies were ailing, &amp; the youngest one
                dangerously ill. Mr. Nordhoff, Saidee's husband, had not crossed with her, but was
                travelling in Germany with a changing address, so that he could not be telegraphed
                to, &amp; soon after we came the doctor, contrary to all professional ettiquette
                gave up the baby's case, &amp; they did not know to whom to apply. So all our week
                which we had been looking forward to as a happy reunion, was given over to anxiety
                &amp; telegrams to doctors and nurses who all seemed to be out of town. At the end 
                of the time, on Saturday, the baby died in his mother's arms. The next day Mr.
                Nordhoff arrived &amp; then we came away, as I was quite worn out with the
                responsibility &amp; anxiety. We have been resting here for a week now, &amp; <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01374.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01374.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01374.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                that Saidee &amp; the other child are better, &amp; that they expect to sail on the
                same day that this letter begins its voyage to cross to thee.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a welcome letter from Dr. Bucke giving good news about thy health, &amp; from thy pen this
                morning in the Century are the army reminiscences which we have all enjoyed
                exceedingly. So I do not feel, somehow as if we were all the world apart. I can
                imagine myself tomorrow crossing the Camden ferry &amp; coming to find thee in thy
                den ready to talk as if I had not ever been away at all. I only wish it could come
                true! I wonder if Mr. Gilchrist is with thee now, &amp; whether
                he has got his professorship in the Art Academy. He promised to write &amp; tell me,
                but I have never heard from him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are at work upon our belated philosophy, grinding
                out the first few chapters which we have long had in the shape of scrappy notes. I
                dont know whether I ever told thee our ambitions. We want to write a philosophy in
                terms simple enough for anyone to understand, explaining what Kant has done in the
                investigation of knowledge, &amp; then going on to make use of the same critical
                method to find out what presuppositions lie at the basis of action. So that we hope
                to establish a method of studying ethics on the same secure basis which philosophers
                now have for the examination of knowledge. But it is incredibly hard to open the
                results of close thinking to people who do not care enough to take the trouble to
                think out for themselves, &amp; every time we try our MS. on one of the uninitiated
                we are profoundly discouraged. I am using these days of leisure to mature a scheme
                of education for Ray, &amp; enlarge my list of books for her. I want to begin her on
                the folklore of all the different nations for her fairy tales, &amp; lead her on
                from that to an interest in the history &amp; geography &amp; government of those
                nations. Logan &amp; Frank &amp; I are also reading a
                little Greek together, &amp; our spare time we give to play— </p>
