      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I feel quite well to-day considering—in good spirits, 
        &amp; free from any pain—I suppose you got my letter Saturday last—
        The doctor has been here to-day, first time in three days—
        (so you see he don't think me a very critical case.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">We have had real March weather here for two or three days, strong &amp; sudden winds, &amp; dust—
        but it is pleasanter to-day—it is now about ½ past 1—I have had my lunch 
        &amp; Mrs. O'Connor has come in for a few moments—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have a little piece in the N. Y. Graphic of Saturday afternoon, March 17—it is a daily afternoon paper—I write for it, so far—they pay moderately.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I feel to-day as if I was getting well—(but my leg is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">so clumsy</span> yet—
        &amp; my head has to avoid much talking or being talked to)—I hope this will 
        find you all right, dearest mother—I think about you much—
      </p>
