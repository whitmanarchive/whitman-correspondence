            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter has reach'd me here, &amp; I am very glad to hear from you all—sorry your father
                suffers so from rheumatism—(but I believe every one has something.) You do not
                say any thing about your mother—I hope she is well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I have been away now over three months—was down on Long Island last July
                &amp; August and then for the last two months have been in Boston, seeing to the
                printing of my complete poems "Leaves of Grass" in one volume—which is all
                done to my satisfaction, &amp; the book will be published now in about a week. I
                came back from Boston last Saturday, &amp; expect to stay in New York ten or twelve
                days, &amp; then back to Camden for a while. I got a letter from Harry six or seven
                weeks ago, wh' I answered,—&amp; have sent him several
                other letters, also papers, which I suppose he has rec'd. I sent him a postal card last Sunday from here in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​ —also a paper
                to Mont—</p>
            
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00012_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00012_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00012_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been &amp; am well as usual—see a great many people, &amp; some how have
                to go around quite a good deal, but I often feel that I sh'd rather be alone out in the woods or especially if I could be down there by
                the old pond, &amp; have no racket or hubbub around me—yet I ought not to
                complain, for I find lots of friends &amp; the very best of good treatment
                continually wherever I go in New England &amp; here in New York—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had a
                long rambling ride this forenoon &amp; midday all about the upper part of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​ 
                island—it is like a fairy land, such hills and lanes and ponds &amp; old trees
                &amp; queer rocks—I just let the horse go his own way, most of the
                time—got home in time for dinner, (3 <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">oclock​ </span><span class="tei_corr">o'clock​
        
      </span></span>) &amp; found your letter among two or three others waiting for
                me—&amp; thought I would answer it without delay—I will send you one of
                the little circulars of my book, although I sent one a week ago to Harry—When
                I was in New England I travel'd quite a good deal—had some splendid rides—good horses &amp;
                good roads—one young lady I fell in

                    with near where I was living had a team of her own, two handsome white ponies,
                &amp; a good light wagon, &amp; she had the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good sense</span> to
                ask to take me out every other day—of course I was nothing loth—Miss
                Mann—a very good driver too, &amp; we did have some jolly times I tell
                you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Saturday evening before I came away I gave a reception to my Boston friends,
                especially the printers &amp;c. We had a jolly time too—there were three
                hundred came &amp; went—at 10 o'clock we had a supper—but one such
                affair will answer for a life time—I enjoy'd it, but I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> want any more—Such things will do better for you young
                folks—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By your letter I suppose Ed and Mont and Van are well as usual &amp; all
                right—I should be real glad to see them &amp; Deb too—When Harry comes
                home Sunday tell him I sent my best love to him, as always—&amp; tell him to
                write to me—I expect to go to Canada this winter—Have you heard any
                thing from Herbert since?—Well it is growing twilight &amp; I must stop—</p>
