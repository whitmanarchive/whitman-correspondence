            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I came off down here on Tuesday, having lectures to give at Cardiff and Swansea on
                Tuesday &amp; Wednesday nights. Now I am staying a few days over with a bright young
                fellow who has a cottage here overlooking the pleasant sweep of Swansea
                Bay;—after over-work day &amp; night in town, you can imagine how good it seems to
                have the sea hard-by, &amp; the free sea-wind a-blowing.</p>

                the lovely headland of Worm's Head some time to-morrow, stopping on the way at King
                Arthur's Seat, &amp; putting up for the night at some old country inn. Altogether it is
                just the sort of excursion that you would delight in, could you only be with us!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Meanwhile I am glad to forget town &amp; things literary, &amp; to loafe &amp; take it easy here, though the
                post brings occasional reminders that London still exists. I must not forget, by the
                way, to say that a note has come to say a package (of portraits presumably) from
                you, awaits my return. For this again, best thanks! I shall be able now to get on
                with my article for the 'Scottish Art Review' as soon as I am back in town. A day or
                two before I left, Ed. Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">2</a> spent an evening with me. He
                showed me your last letter to him. He was well. I devoutly pray that you are not
                suffering so much as you were.</p>

                    say simply in a young man's way to you who are an old man now, how dearly and
                    earnestly I think of you across the sea to-night, remembering the Past, looking
                    on to the great to-morrow, for perhaps of all young men you have helped me most
                    powerfully &amp; perfectly." On <a href="loc.03311">July 7, 1885</a> Rhys
                    proposed a one-shilling edition of Whitman's poetry in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Canterbury Poets</span> series. On <a href="loc.03312">September

                    so far in vain," and included the payment from Walter Scott, the English
                    publisher of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Canterbury Poets</span>. On Rhys's letter
                    Whitman wrote: "the little English selection from L. of G. is out since, &amp;

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
