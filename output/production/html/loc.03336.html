                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I came off down here on Tuesday, having lectures to give at Cardiff and Swansea on
                Tuesday &amp; Wednesday nights. Now I am staying a few days over with a bright young
                fellow who has a cottage here overlooking the pleasant sweep of Swansea
                Bay;—after over-work day &amp; night in town, you can imagine how good it seems to
                have the sea hard-by, &amp; the free sea-wind a-blowing.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">In an hour or two, we shall set off for a two or three days tramp through the remote
                sea-slopes of Gower. The coast scenery is said to be very fine. We will<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03336.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03336.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03336.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> expect to reach
                the lovely headland of Worm's Head some time to-morrow, stopping on the way at King
                Arthur's Seat, &amp; putting up for the night at some old country inn. Altogether it is
                just the sort of excursion that you would delight in, could you only be with us!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Meanwhile I am glad to forget town &amp; things literary, &amp; to loafe &amp; take it easy here, though the
                post brings occasional reminders that London still exists. I must not forget, by the
                way, to say that a note has come to say a package (of portraits presumably) from
                you, awaits my return. For this again, best thanks! I shall be able now to get on
                with my article for the 'Scottish Art Review' as soon as I am back in town. A day or
                two before I left, Ed. Carpenter spent an evening with me. He
                showed me your last letter to him. He was well. I devoutly pray that you are not
                suffering so much as you were.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Swansea Bay is famous for its oysters. The flavour they are were like the
                    American, though small in size. Wish I could send you some!</p>
