                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
                    Whitman. Wallace, along with Dr. John Johnston (1852–1927), a physician in
                    Bolton, founded the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston
                    and Wallace corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members
                    of the Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet
                    and published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace,

                    the help of his brother Tom, printed Whitman's first edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> (1855) in a small shop at the
                    intersection of Fulton and Cranberry in Brooklyn. It was likely the first book
                    the firm ever printed. Wallace had contacted Rome while on his North American
                    trip and arranged to have him travel to Camden to reunite with Whitman; see

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
