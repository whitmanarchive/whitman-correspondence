            </span> 

            <p class="tei_p">Again a few lines to you. The past summer &amp; fall have laid me up again, &amp; I
                am now entering the sixth month of confinement in my big chair &amp; sick
                room—commenced early in June—abt the sixth <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whack</span>
                (as I call it) from my old obstinate war-paralysis—from the overstrain'd work
                &amp; excitement of Secession years, 1863, 4 &amp; 5. I am now staving it off and
                on, but it is a serious siege &amp; I do not really look for it being raised
                anything like really—I am in good spirits &amp; comfortable enough. Mr.
                    Fry<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> (of England bro't a note from you) call'd upon
                me yesterday—and I sent you by him my new little book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span><a href="#n3999" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3999">2</a> (but it will be a week before he
                sails home). I have also a big 900 page Vol. nearly ready, combining all my
                writings, last revisions,<a href="#n6157" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6157">3</a> &amp;c.—I will send you a copy—Do you see
                anything of Rolleston?<a href="#n1027" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1027">4</a> If so I send him my affectionate
                remembrances—I am sitting by my oak-wood fire writing this (cold but sunny
                weather here)—Spend most of my time alone—a few visitors—get along
                better than you might suppose. Love &amp; thanks to you, my friend, &amp; best best
                regards to my Irish friends all.</p>

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
