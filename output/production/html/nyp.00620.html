            </span> 

            <p class="tei_p">Again a few lines to you. The past summer &amp; fall have laid me up again, &amp; I
                am now entering the sixth month of confinement in my big chair &amp; sick
                room—commenced early in June—abt the sixth <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whack</span>
                (as I call it) from my old obstinate war-paralysis—from the overstrain'd work
                &amp; excitement of Secession years, 1863, 4 &amp; 5. I am now staving it off and
                on, but it is a serious siege &amp; I do not really look for it being raised
                anything like really—I am in good spirits &amp; comfortable enough. Mr.
                    Fry (of England bro't a note from you) call'd upon
                me yesterday—and I sent you by him my new little book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> (but it will be a week before he
                sails home). I have also a big 900 page Vol. nearly ready, combining all my
                writings, last revisions, &amp;c.—I will send you a copy—Do you see
                anything of Rolleston? If so I send him my affectionate
                remembrances—I am sitting by my oak-wood fire writing this (cold but sunny
                weather here)—Spend most of my time alone—a few visitors—get along
                better than you might suppose. Love &amp; thanks to you, my friend, &amp; best best
                regards to my Irish friends all.</p>
