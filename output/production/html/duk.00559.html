            thing that could be done
            i wrote a letter to 
            her last week a good
            letter and i gave mr
            heyde hint of his insult
            to you and not giving
            han the letter i wrote nothing
            ugly to him for fear it
            would be worse for

                        December 10, 1868, which fell on Thursday in 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke
                        dated the letter December 10, 1868, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed (Walt
                        Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). The subjects of this letter are
                        consistent with early December 1868, both in the matter of the recent
                        amputation of Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's thumb and in the plans by Thomas
                        Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha "Mattie" Whitman to depart Brooklyn soon
                        for St. Louis without visiting Walt Whitman in Washington.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa enclosed in this letter to Walt a December 1868 letter from Charles
                        Heyde that described the surgical amputation of his wife Hannah Heyde's
                        thumb (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint
                            Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
                            Family</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
                        225–226). Miller dated Heyde's letter to "[a]bout December 8" (Walt
                        Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, 2:72–73, n. 37). A
                        second point of corroboration for the date of the present letter is Louisa's
                        statement that Jeff and Mattie no longer plan to visit Walt in Washington.
                        That statement affirms Louisa's observation, in her <a href="duk.00557">November 30–December 3, 1868</a> letter to Walt, that "i hardly
                        think they will come to washington." Indeed, Jeff and Mattie departed for
                        St. Louis shortly after this letter (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00635">December 15–19, 1868</a> letter to Walt). Since the letter must
                        precede Louisa's December 15–19 letter and since Louisa enclosed
                        Heyde's December 8 letter, it must date to the Thursday following Heyde's,
                        December 10, 1868.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
