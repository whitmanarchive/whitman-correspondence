            <p class="tei_p">I have just received this
                letter from mr heydd
            i feel real sad to 
            think poor han has lost
            her thumb but if the bone was
            affected it was the only
            thing that could be done
            i wrote a letter to 
            her last week a good
            letter and i gave mr
            heyde hint of his insult
            to you and not giving
            han the letter i wrote nothing
            ugly to him for fear it
            would be worse for
            han) i think very likely
            she will get better
            now if she dont fret
            about it it is good
                its on her left hand
            as she can sew
            without it</p>
