                cool, though pleasant and sunny—now here laid by in the fifth month—all
                my strength, all <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bodily-ab't-going-ability</span> quite
                gone—Spend most of the time here in the big ratan-chair—yet good heart
                though (in emotionality &amp; mental action)—no sign either of any change or
                improvement of strength recuperation—But we will see—"(Are we to be
                beaten down this way in our old age"?)

            <p class="tei_p">J B, I hope it is all going well with you—your little visit did me
                good—hope you will write me when you can—W O'C, have been thinking of
                that eye trouble—hope it has gone down or entirely over—Hope this letter
                from Mary Costelloe will interest you—Show it to Nelly—in some respects it is a
                woman's letter, but I like it much—Doctor, the photo came this
                forenoon—it is one of the best I ever saw—Can you send one to J B and to
                W O'C?—Some of those photo places off one side appear to make the best
                pictures in the world—My printing matters (or rather <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">binding</span> ones) go 
                on all right but slowly—</p>
