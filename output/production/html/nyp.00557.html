            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> Just a line to give you my changed address. I have been here
                since October last—very busy all last summer getting a little homestead built,
                and this winter digging and planting—have about seven acres
                altogether—we are gardening about two acres; fruit, flowers and vegetables;
                have about two and a half acres grass and about the same quantity part wheat for
                ourselves and part oats for the horse. My friends the Fearnehoughs<a href="#n3063" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3063">1</a> have come with me, and we are employing one or two extra hands
                beside, just now. It is a beautiful valley right up against the Derbyshire moors,
                but warm; we are about eight miles form Sheffield and five and a half from
                Chesterfield—three and a half from the nearest station. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I got your bit about the American aborigines.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> Thanks. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> There is a quite old flour mill here, from which the place no doubt takes its name;
                very quaint old wooden wheels and cogs—the stream which feeds it runs at the
                bottom of my three fields—lots of wood and water all about the valley.
                Millthorpe itself is a small hamlet of a dozen houses or so. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Have not seen the Gilchrists<a href="#n3001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3001">3</a> for some time, but I heard from
                Grace the other day. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I was reading Rolleston's<a href="#n1027" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1027">4</a> translation into German of your
                Answerer this morning. It is as far as I can judge very exact and natural. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I hope you are well and enjoying yourself. I often think about you. Best
                remembrances to the Staffords<a href="#n1009" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1009">5</a> when you see them. </p>

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
                    pieces of criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "A Woman's

                    Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
                    love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
                    visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
                    a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman

                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first

                    befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents, George (1827–1892) and
                    Susan Stafford (1833–1910), were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
                    Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. In the
                    1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more on
