                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> Just a line to give you my changed address. I have been here
                since October last—very busy all last summer getting a little homestead built,
                and this winter digging and planting—have about seven acres
                altogether—we are gardening about two acres; fruit, flowers and vegetables;
                have about two and a half acres grass and about the same quantity part wheat for
                ourselves and part oats for the horse. My friends the Fearnehoughs have come with me, and we are employing one or two extra hands
                beside, just now. It is a beautiful valley right up against the Derbyshire moors,
                but warm; we are about eight miles form Sheffield and five and a half from
                Chesterfield—three and a half from the nearest station. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I got your bit about the American aborigines. Thanks. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> There is a quite old flour mill here, from which the place no doubt takes its name;
                very quaint old wooden wheels and cogs—the stream which feeds it runs at the
                bottom of my three fields—lots of wood and water all about the valley.
                Millthorpe itself is a small hamlet of a dozen houses or so. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Have not seen the Gilchrists for some time, but I heard from
                Grace the other day. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I was reading Rolleston's translation into German of your
                Answerer this morning. It is as far as I can judge very exact and natural. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I hope you are well and enjoying yourself. I often think about you. Best
                remembrances to the Staffords when you see them. </p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Your affectionate</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Edward Carpenter.</span>
