            <p class="tei_p">I will send a line to you even if but for good love &amp; memories to you—for I
                have them always for you—Was prostrated down with ab't the sixth recurrent
                attack of my paralysis again and iron-bound constipation early last June &amp; have
                been kept ever since in my sick room &amp; am so yet—with even other troubles,
                a bladder affection, enlarged prostrate glands—a pretty complete physical
                wreck. Still I keep up a good part of the time—have bro't out a little book
                "November Boughs" wh' I send a copy to you same mail with this—Also am
                finishing a big Vol. comprehending all my stuff, poems &amp; prose, makes ab't 900
                pages—A good young friend, Horace Traubel here, has help'd
                me between the printing office, bringing &amp; carrying proofs, &amp;c, so that I
                have ab't finished these jobs ready for binder—I am still at 328 Mickle
                Street—have not been out doors for over six months—hardly out my
                room—Have a good young strong &amp; helper &amp; nurse, Ed Wilkins—But get along better than you might think for—Your
                friend Mr Williams call'd to-day—Herbert Gilchrist is
                here at 1708 Chestnut, Philadelphia—he is well &amp; doing well—The
                    Staffords are ab't as usual—they come up here
                &amp; see me</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Friday noon, Dec: 7</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am up, had a partial bath, a bit of breakfast &amp; am now sitting my big chair by
                the oak wood fire finishing this—fine sunny cold weather—considerable
                bladder troubles, pains, &amp;c. Send me soon the Misses Fords' address &amp; I will send Nov: Boughs—Love to
                them—Love to you, dear friend—</p>
