            <p class="tei_p">Just as I get ready to write you a line, Mrs. Davis calls
                me to dinner—So as that is important, I will put down the lap tablet on which
                I am writing—&amp; finish afterwards—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well I had my dinner, cold meat, hot potatoes, nice stew'd tomatoes &amp; onions,
                &amp; a cup of tea &amp; Graham bread—enjoyed all—Am feeling pretty well
                these times—a couple of Wilson Barrett's actors
                came over in a carriage yesterday afternoon &amp; took me to the theatre to see
                    "Clito"—had a good afternoon ride &amp;
                performance—was used tip top—Mrs Davis went with me—got back here
                ab't sunset thro' a snow storm—My friend Wm O'Connor is
                in a very bad way—locomotor ataxia—he is now in Los Angeles County
                California—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It looks like winter out as I write, all white with snow—I havn't heard just
                lately from George &amp; Lou or Ed—but I am sure they are all right—Love to you, Jessie dear—</p>
