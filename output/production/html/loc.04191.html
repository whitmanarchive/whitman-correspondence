            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thank you from my heart for the gift of your great book—that beautiful
                complete book of your poems &amp; your prose, which I call "Whitman's Bible."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But my heart has not the power to make my brain &amp; hands tell you how much I thank
                you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">None of your eleves, your disciples, will be able to tell the world what they have
                gained from you, what they owe to you, what you are for them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot even attempt to tell yourself (upon this page of paper with this pen in my
                hand), what it is that makes me ask you now to bless me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If my health, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">riven</span> to the bottom like a tree in me, twelve years ago,—&amp;
                the cares of a family, complicated with this affair of health—had not
                prevented, I should long ago had come to see you in the flesh, to ask counsel of
                you, &amp; to assure you of my inviolable fidelity.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are both growing old, &amp; nearly half a hemisphere divides us. Yet nothing can
                divide souls, or separate that which is inseparable in the divine nature of the
                world.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps we shall yet meet: &amp; then, beyond the death of this life, I shall ask you
                about things which have perplexed me here—to which I think you alone could
                have given me an acceptable answer. All such matters
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00341.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00341.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00341.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                will probably sink into their proper place
                in the infinite perspective; &amp; when we meet, a comrade's hand-touch &amp; a kiss
                will satisfy me, &amp; a look into your eyes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But, if we come to be judged, I shall go to the judgment-seat &amp; say: "Call out
                Walt Whitman. Let him pronounce upon the doings of this man this me; &amp; let me
                be confronted with him; before you judges pass your sentence."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot find words better fitted to express the penetrative force with which you
                have entered into me, my reliance on you, &amp; my hope that you will not disapprove
                of my conduct in the last resort.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">As I cannot talk to you, I feel the need to say this; because you have exercised a
                controlling influence over me for half a century.

                can say so much as I am saying to a man whom he has never seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Those lines which I wrote in September of this year,
                &amp; which I am glad to see now circulated, were calculated for the public mind!
                They do not tell the half; but, as an old Greek proverb puts it, "the half is better
                than the whole"—in print at any rate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I read your Bible, I miss—&amp; I had missed for many years in new
                editions—the poem which first thrilled me like a trumpet-call to you. It was
                called: "Long I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me" [Calamus 8. ed:
                    1860–61]. Why have you so consistently omitted
                this in the canon of your works?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Upon me, your disciple, it
              <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00343.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00343.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00343.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                made a decisive impact. "I put down the book, filled with the bitterest envy." And I rose up, to follow you. I miss the words
                now.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am old now, &amp; you are older in years, though everlastingly young, in ways not
                given to all men to be so. So perhaps I ought not ask why you omitted that poem from
                "Calamus," &amp; what you meant by it. It means for me so infinitely much. I cannot
                say how much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well: the disciple weighs his master's words, too scrupulously—&amp; thinks
                perhaps too much of his omissions or dark sayings. He must not ask for answers to
                his questions, but express the total of the teaching in his works &amp; ways.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">That I shall do ever, so far as I am your man—marked with your seal &amp;
                superscription, &amp; what my addiction to you will later bring <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00344.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00344.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00344.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>forth, is a matter for
                the literary historians of England to decide—if only I had life &amp; time for
                future working.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">More &amp; more of you will be found in me, the longer I live &amp; the firmer I
                become in manhood.</p>
