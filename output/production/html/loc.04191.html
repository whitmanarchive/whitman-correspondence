            <p class="tei_p">We are both growing old, &amp; nearly half a hemisphere divides us. Yet nothing can
                divide souls, or separate that which is inseparable in the divine nature of the
                world.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps we shall yet meet: &amp; then, beyond the death of this life, I shall ask you
                about things which have perplexed me here—to which I think you alone could

            <p class="tei_p">But, if we come to be judged, I shall go to the judgment-seat &amp; say: "Call out
                Walt Whitman. Let him pronounce upon the doings of this man this me; &amp; let me
                be confronted with him; before you judges pass your sentence."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot find words better fitted to express the penetrative force with which you
                have entered into me, my reliance on you, &amp; my hope that you will not disapprove
                of my conduct in the last resort.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">As I cannot talk to you, I feel the need to say this; because you have exercised a
                controlling influence over me for half a century.

                can say so much as I am saying to a man whom he has never seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Those lines which I wrote in September of this year,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
                &amp; which I am glad to see now circulated, were calculated for the public mind!
                They do not tell the half; but, as an old Greek proverb puts it, "the half is better
                than the whole"—in print at any rate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I read your Bible, I miss—&amp; I had missed for many years in new
                editions—the poem which first thrilled me like a trumpet-call to you. It was
                called: "Long I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me" [Calamus 8. ed:
                    1860–61].<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Why have you so consistently omitted
                this in the canon of your works?</p>

                now.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am old now, &amp; you are older in years, though everlastingly young, in ways not
                given to all men to be so. So perhaps I ought not ask why you omitted that poem from
                "Calamus," &amp; what you meant by it. It means for me so infinitely much. I cannot
                say how much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well: the disciple weighs his master's words, too scrupulously—&amp; thinks
                perhaps too much of his omissions or dark sayings. He must not ask for answers to
                his questions, but express the total of the teaching in his works &amp; ways.</p>
