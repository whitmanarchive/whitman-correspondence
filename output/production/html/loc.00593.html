         <p class="tei_p">You will find the article you sent will be in the Times of this morning, when it is published. I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> have crowded out a great many things to get it in, and it has taken the precedence of army correspondence and articles which have been waiting a month for insertion. It is excellent—the first part and the closing part of it especially. I am glad to see you are engaged in such good work at Washington. It must be even more refreshing than to sit by Pfaff's privy<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> and eat sweet-breads and drink coffee, and listen to the intolerable wit of the crack-brains. I happened in there the other night, and the place smelt as atrociously as ever. Pfaff looked as of yore. I read your article in proof and hope it's all accurate enough. "The field large—the reapers few" is the finest paragraph. Everything in New York moves on pretty much as usual. It's the old town—only different.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My brother William<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> sailed for Port Royal ten days ago—to be present at the attack on Charleston—if it is to be attacked.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>

            <p class="tei_p">Do you know Conway of Kansas?<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> He is a good man If you don't know him, and if he would be of any service to you in any way, I know he would be rejoiced to serve you, if you mentioned my name to him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The article has some things in that I could recognize you by, but not many. I like it better on that account than I should otherwise.—Hoping that Vicksburg may soon fall.</p>

                    managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's
                    beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman. On January 23, 1874 (Whitman said
                    "1884"), Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter": "It was
                    perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the 'Leaves of
                    Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street, Brooklyn.
                    I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something that
                    touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me, grown
                    around me, and grown into me" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel,

                    Littlefield, 1905], 1:24). He praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                        Herald</span> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 36-37).
                    Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party for the
                    mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New
                        York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the weekly labor journal,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Swinton's Paper</span>. When this publication folded,

                    tactics led to his suspension as a reporter on July 1, 1864. Whitman did not
                    have a high opinion of William's journalism; see his letter from <a href="loc.00834">June 10, 1864</a>. He was professor of English at the
                    University of California from 1869 to 1874. Thereafter he compiled extremely

                    Emancipation Proclamation went into effect, in Massachusetts with Ralph Waldo
                    Emerson, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Julia Ward Howe. That
                    same month, he introduced a resolution before Congress calling for recognition
                    of the Confederacy, so that war with the South might be fought as a war between
