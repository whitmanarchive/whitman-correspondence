         <p class="tei_p">You will find the article you sent will be in the Times of this morning, when it is published. I have crowded out a great many things to get it in, and it has taken the precedence of army correspondence and articles which have been waiting a month for insertion. It is excellent—the first part and the closing part of it especially. I am glad to see you are engaged in such good work at Washington. It must be even more refreshing than to sit by Pfaff's privy and eat sweet-breads and drink coffee, and listen to the intolerable wit of the crack-brains. I happened in there the other night, and the place smelt as atrociously as ever. Pfaff looked as of yore. I read your article in proof and hope it's all accurate enough. "The field large—the reapers few" is the finest paragraph. Everything in New York moves on pretty much as usual. It's the old town—only different.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My brother William sailed for Port Royal ten days ago—to be present at the attack on Charleston—if it is to be attacked.

            <p class="tei_p">Do you know Conway of Kansas? He is a good man If you don't know him, and if he would be of any service to you in any way, I know he would be rejoiced to serve you, if you mentioned my name to him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The article has some things in that I could recognize you by, but not many. I like it better on that account than I should otherwise.—Hoping that Vicksburg may soon fall.</p>
