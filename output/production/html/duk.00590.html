                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The date is certain. The letter was
                    written after Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was notified of the death of her son
                    Jesse Whitman, and it followed a large wind storm that produced substantial
                    damage in Brooklyn, New York. Because the day Monday in Louisa's hand is
                    consistent with the Brooklyn storm after Jesse's death, the letter dates to
                    March 28, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00590_n2 note" id="duk.00590_n2"><span>Jesse Whitman
                    (1818–1870) died at Kings County Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Walt
                    Whitman was notified of his brother's death (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22, 1870</a> letter), and Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman probably received a copy of Warner's letter from Walt. However, Walt's
                    March 26?, 1870 letter to Louisa is not extant (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:362). Jesse had suffered from mental illness that included
                    threats of violence for several years before he was committed to an asylum,
                    where he was placed in December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed
                    his brother Andrew Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened
                    Martha Mitchell and Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff
                    sought to "put him in some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see
                    Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa
                    resisted institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in
                    my heart to put him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings
                    County Lunatic Asylum on Flatbush Avenue. For a short biography of Jesse, see

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
                    death in 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_225.html">Whitman, Martha
