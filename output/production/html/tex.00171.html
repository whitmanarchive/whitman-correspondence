                    1869. The executors did not mark this letter with a date, and Edwin Haviland
                    Miller did not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:367). Based on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's belief that Emily
                    Price had married recently, this letter dates to the year 1869. The month, May,
                    can be inferred from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter "M" and her <a href="duk.00578">April 7, 1869</a> letter: "i suppose you know Emily
                    price is going to get married." However, the date of Emily Price's marriage is
                    not certain. In her <a href="duk.00598">July 14, 1869</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman, Louisa wrote, "i beleive they think emmily [Price] will be married this
                    fall." That later letter cannot be easily reconciled with this one, but perhaps
                    the marriage was delayed several months without Louisa's being aware of the
                    postponement. Despite that complicating difficulty, this letter's date in May
                    corresponds to the appointment of a new Brooklyn Water Board. </span></span> [<a href="#r9">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00613_n1 note" id="duk.00613_n1"><span>Walt befriended Peter Doyle
                    (1843–1907), a horsecar conductor in Washington, around 1865. Though
                    Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
                    Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
                    contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
                    stroke in January 1873.

                    lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
                    pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
                    poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the

                    and two poems by Whitman were first published in the periodical in the 1880s.

                    daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
                    daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
                    movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
                    the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
                    1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
                    letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice

                    man named Law, an "artist in the cheap picture line." This letter seems to
                    confirm her marriage in late April or early May 1869. She married a man named

                    wrote "i beleive thats name" in reference to "lessee farlands." The word
                    "lessee" may be a name, but it could also refer to the proprietor of the
                    boarding house. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Directory</span> (1871) lists two
                    close names that may be boarding houses, a widow Ann Farlan and a clerk Matthew
                    Farlands, and the directory lists thirty-five surnames from "McFarlan" through
                    "McFarlane." The term "lessee" usually refers to the tenant, but Thomas Gunn
                    Butler also used it to refer to a proprietor, which may indicate its currency to
                    refer to tenants in Brooklyn slang (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Physiology of New York

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken

                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
