            <p class="tei_p">I wish you would apply to the Librarian of Congress's office for the copyright at
                once—take it out of course in your own name—send the enclosed printed
                title page—&amp; ask for a certificate—it is $1—(50¢ for
                entry &amp; 50 for cert[ificate].)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Every thing is going on well—but slowly with the book. It will be out last of
                the month. I shall send you an earliest copy or two. The publisher McKay told me to
                say to you that you can have at half price ($1) whatever number of copies you
                want "for personal or literary use"—Dr Bucke is absent from London on official
                business—(though I believe it is about time for him to return)—At last
                accounts John Burroughs was home in Delaware county, recuperating in the maple sugar
                woods—he was better—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Do you see in the Heywood trial, the Judge peremptorily ruled out the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G</span>​  slips part of the indictment—(which ruling out "was received with
                applause") &amp; H was afterwards on the remaining part or parts acquitted. So
                A[nthony] C[omstock] retires with his tail intensely curved inwards. I am just starting for two or three days down in my Jersey woods retreat.</p>

                    page—so at his request I left it out—(I partly coincided with
                        him)—</p>
