                        August, since on <a href="loc.00578">August 17, 1860</a>, Thayer &amp;
                        Eldridge thanked Whitman for his advice about the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New-York
                            Saturday Press</span> and informed him that the firm had made an offer to
                        Clapp to assume financial control on September 1. Thayer &amp; Eldridge
                        believed that it could make the journal "pay": "Beside[s] we are deeply
                        interested in sustaining any journal that dares in these days of literary
                        flunkeyism to be independent, and make the literature of a country what it
                        should be." Clapp had suggested to Whitman on <a href="loc.00568">March
                            27, 1860</a>, that he might get Thayer &amp; Eldridge to "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">advance me say one hundred dollars on advertising
                            account</span>." On <a href="med.00331">May 14, 1860</a>, Clapp was
                        "in a state of despair . . . all for the want of a paltry two or three
                        hundred dollars" which he needed to bring out the next issue.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
