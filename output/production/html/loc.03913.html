            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Sitting here in the library, alone in a great big house, I thought I would write you
                a few lines to pass for a letter,—though the Lord only knows what I shall write
                about, for I have no news to tell, &amp; nothing special to say—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I came out here on a visit to an old friend<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> a few days
                ago, &amp; shall stay here perhaps the ensuing week—The family, (&amp; a fine
                one they are) are at Newport for the summer—my friend, the father, goes to his
                business in Philadelphia absent all day, &amp; I am left here master of a large
                house garden, library &amp;c. with servants, horses,—a good dinner at 1 o'clock
                every day—have to eat it all by myself, but I enjoy it—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00524_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00524_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00524_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00524_large.jpg</span>It is a Quaker
                family I am very much attached to—(I believe I have mentioned them to you
                before)—all kind &amp; good—but the ones that seem most to me are the
                eldest daughter Mary (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  21) the brightest happiest sunniest cutest young woman you ever saw, &amp;
                probably you would say upon knowing her, a new &amp; different combination of
                character from any you ever saw—&amp; one I am sure you would like—And
                then the father himself, my friend—he is in business in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​ —he has been a great traveler in Europe, &amp; something of a
                preacher—he is a good talker—&amp; very kind—we always have a good
                long ride, from 5 to 7½ afternoons—which I enjoy very much—&amp;
                then return to supper—&amp; a couple of hours talking, reading &amp;c.</p>

                been here quite a good deal the last year &amp; a half, when they were all
                home—but now no one but the father &amp; myself here—I wish you could
                have two or three good drives with me about here—we have a fast, strong,
                gentle young sorrel mare—first rate—the roads &amp; views are the
                finest you ever saw—&amp; now they show at their best—Yesterday (Sunday)
                afternoon &amp; evening <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="seemed​ ">seem'd</span>​  to me one of the most perfect for weather &amp;c I ever knew—we
                drove out to a hill about an hour from here &amp; had a view over twenty miles
                towards Bethlehem,—fields &amp; farms &amp; rolling country—some
                woods—the richest tract in Pennsylvania. It was an hour before sundown. It was
                like Paradise. (It will have a good effect upon me the rest of the summer.)</p>

                    sustained at this time is not known, unless he referred to the 200 shares of
                    stock he purchased on February 26 in the Sierra Grande mines at Lake Valley, New
                    Mexico. According to a prospectus mounted in Whitman's Commonplace Book, shares
                    in the company had a par value of $25. He received his first dividend
                    ($50) on March 6, but he did not receive the second dividend, evidently
                    payable on July 6, when he was with the Staffords, until October 3. Perhaps the
                    delay in payment made him think that he had lost his money. He may have
                    fabricated this story because Mrs. Stafford wanted to borrow money. He lent her
                    $50 on October 24, 1882 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
