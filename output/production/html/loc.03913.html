                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Sitting here in the library, alone in a great big house, I thought I would write you
                a few lines to pass for a letter,—though the Lord only knows what I shall write
                about, for I have no news to tell, &amp; nothing special to say—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I came out here on a visit to an old friend a few days
                ago, &amp; shall stay here perhaps the ensuing week—The family, (&amp; a fine
                one they are) are at Newport for the summer—my friend, the father, goes to his
                business in Philadelphia absent all day, &amp; I am left here master of a large
                house garden, library &amp;c. with servants, horses,—a good dinner at 1 o'clock
                every day—have to eat it all by myself, but I enjoy it—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00524_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00524_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00524_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>It is a Quaker
                family I am very much attached to—(I believe I have mentioned them to you
                before)—all kind &amp; good—but the ones that seem most to me are the
                eldest daughter Mary (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  21) the brightest happiest sunniest cutest young woman you ever saw, &amp;
                probably you would say upon knowing her, a new &amp; different combination of
                character from any you ever saw—&amp; one I am sure you would like—And
                then the father himself, my friend—he is in business in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​ —he has been a great traveler in Europe, &amp; something of a
                preacher—he is a good talker—&amp; very kind—we always have a good
                long ride, from 5 to 7½ afternoons—which I enjoy very much—&amp;
                then return to supper—&amp; a couple of hours talking, reading &amp;c.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00525_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00525_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00525_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">Then there is all now at Newport as I said another daughter &amp; a son, a young man—all dear friends of mine—I have
                been here quite a good deal the last year &amp; a half, when they were all
                home—but now no one but the father &amp; myself here—I wish you could
                have two or three good drives with me about here—we have a fast, strong,
                gentle young sorrel mare—first rate—the roads &amp; views are the
                finest you ever saw—&amp; now they show at their best—Yesterday (Sunday)
                afternoon &amp; evening <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="seemed​ ">seem'd</span>​  to me one of the most perfect for weather &amp;c I ever knew—we
                drove out to a hill about an hour from here &amp; had a view over twenty miles
                towards Bethlehem,—fields &amp; farms &amp; rolling country—some
                woods—the richest tract in Pennsylvania. It was an hour before sundown. It was
                like Paradise. (It will have a good effect upon me the rest of the summer.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mont was in to see me <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  a week ago—By his <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​  you must have a house full. I hope you keep up health &amp;
                spirits—Love to Ruth—Ed also—(I havn't forgot those rides evenings off among the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pea-pickers</span>)—Respects to Messrs. Wyld and Edwards—Nothing specially new with me—I am only
                middling well—seem to be getting clumsier than ever, more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">loguey</span>—rheumatic &amp; other ailments—My loss (money, dues,
