                    "Courtland") Palmer (1843–1888) was an attorney and the founder and first
                    president of the Nineteenth Century Club, a group dedicated to discussing
                    significant social and philosophical issues of the time. Palmer was a
                    freethinker as well as a friend of the noted orator Colonel Robert Ingersoll.
                    Upon Palmer's death in 1888, Whitman remarked to his disciple Horace Traubel:
                    "They may bury Palmer—they will bury him and I do not feel like crying
                    over his grave. There's only one word for some graves—hurrah is that word.
                    Hurrah is the word for brave Palmer!" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
