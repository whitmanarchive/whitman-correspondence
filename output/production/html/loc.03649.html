            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">All the papers have reached me—3 separate packets (with the 
                hand writing on them that makes my heart give a glad bound). I look through them full 
                of interest &amp; curiosity, wanting to realize as I do, in things small as well as 
                things large my Land of Promise—the land where I hope to plant down my 
                children—so strong in the faith that they, &amp; perhaps still more those that 
                come after them will bless me for that (consciously or unconsciously, it doesn't matter 
                which) that I should set out with a cheerful heart on that errand if I knew the first 
                breath I drew on American soil, would be my last in life.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00212.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00212.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00212.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
            <p class="tei_p">I searched hopeful for a few words telling of improvement in your health, in the last 
                paper. But perhaps it does not follow from there being no such mention that there is 
                no progress. May you be steadily though ever so slowly gaining ground, my Darling! Now 
                that I understand the nature of the malady (a deficient flow of blood to the brain if 
                it has been rightly explained to me) I realize that recovery 
                must be very gradual: as the coming on of it must have been slow &amp; insidious. And 
                perhaps that, &amp; also even from before the war time with its tremendous strain emotional 
                &amp; physical &amp; is part of the price paid for the greatness of the Poems &amp; 
                for their immortal destiny—the rapt exaltation the intensity of joy &amp; sorrow 
                &amp; struggle—all that went to give them their life giving power. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00213.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00213.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00213.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                For I have felt many times in reading them as if the light &amp; heat of their sacred 
                fire must needs have consumed the vital energies of him in whose breast it was generated, 
                faster than even the most splendid physique could renew itself. For our sakes, for 
                humanity's sake you suffer now, I do not doubt, every bit as much as the soldier's 
                wounds are for his country's sake. The more precious the more tenderly cherished, the 
                more drawing the hearts that understand, with ineffable yearnings for this.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My children all continue well in the main. I am thankful to say though Beatrice 
                (the eldest girl, looks paler than I could wish &amp; is working her brains too much 
                &amp; the rest of her too little just at present with the hope of getting through 
                the Apothecaries Hall exam: in Arts next Sept. which involves a good bit of Latin 
                and mathematics. This is all women can do in England toward getting into

                the medical profession &amp; as the Apoth; Hall certificate is accepted for the preliminary 
                studies at Paris &amp; Zurich, I make no doubt it is also at Philadelphia &amp; New York so 
                that she would be able to enter on medical studies then national preliminary work when we 
                come. For she continues steadfastly desirous to win her way into that field of usefulness 
                &amp; I believe is well fitted to work there with her grave earnest thoughtful feeling nature 
                &amp; strong bodily frame. She is able to enjoy your Poems &amp; the vistas: broods over them 
                a great deal.—Percy is bending his energies now to mastering 
                the processes that go to the production of the very best quality of Copper such as is used for 
                telegraph wires &amp;c. no easy matter, copper being the most difficult, in a metallurgical 
                point of view of all the metals to deal with &amp; the Company in whose

                employ he is having hitherto been unsuccessful in this branch. His looks, too, do not 
                quite satisfy me:—it is partly rather too long hours of work—but still more 
                not getting a good meal till the end of it. It is so hard to make the young believe that 
                the stomach shares the fatigue of the rest of the body &amp; that there is not nervous 
                energy enough left for it to do all its principal work to perfection after a long exhausting 
                day. But I hope now I or rather his own experience &amp; I together have convinced him 
                in time &amp; he promises me faithfully to arrange for a good meal in the middle of the 
                day however much grudging the time. My little artist Herby is still 
                chiefly working from the antique, but tries his hand at home occasionally with oils &amp; 
                to life &amp; has made an oil sketch of me which though imperfect in drawing &amp;c gives 
                far more the real character &amp; expression

                of my face than the photographs. Have you heard, I wonder, of William Rossetti's 
                approaching marriage. It is to take place early in the New Year. The lady is Lucy Brown 
                daughter of one of our most eminent artists (he was the friend who 
                first put into my hand the "Selections" from your Poems). Lucy is 
                a very sweet tempered cultivated <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">loveable​ </span><span class="tei_corr">lovable​

                woman well fitted I should say to make William 
                Rossetti happy. They are to continue in the old home Euston Sq. with Mrs. Rossetti &amp; 
                the Sisters who are one &amp; all fond of Lucy. I am glad he is going to be married for 
                I think he is a man capable both of giving and receiving a large measure of domestic 
                happiness. I hope the dear little girls at St. Louis
