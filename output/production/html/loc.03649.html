            <p class="tei_p">All the papers have reached me—3 separate packets (with the 
                hand writing on them that makes my heart give a glad bound). I look through them full 
                of interest &amp; curiosity, wanting to realize as I do, in things small as well as 
                things large my Land of Promise—the land where I hope to plant down my 
                children—so strong in the faith that they, &amp; perhaps still more those that 
                come after them will bless me for that (consciously or unconsciously, it doesn't matter 
                which) that I should set out with a cheerful heart on that errand if I knew the first 
                breath I drew on American soil, would be my last in life.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I searched hopeful for a few words telling of improvement in your health,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a> in the last 
                paper. But perhaps it does not follow from there being no such mention that there is 
                no progress. May you be steadily though ever so slowly gaining ground, my Darling! Now 
                that I understand the nature of the malady (a deficient flow of blood to the brain if 
                it has been rightly explained to me) I realize that recovery 
                must be very gradual: as the coming on of it must have been slow &amp; insidious. And 
                perhaps that, &amp; also even from before the war time with its tremendous strain emotional 
                &amp; physical &amp; is part of the price paid for the greatness of the Poems &amp; 
                for their immortal destiny—the rapt exaltation the intensity of joy &amp; sorrow 
                &amp; struggle—all that went to give them their life giving power.

                For I have felt many times in reading them as if the light &amp; heat of their sacred 
                fire must needs have consumed the vital energies of him in whose breast it was generated, 
                faster than even the most splendid physique could renew itself. For our sakes, for 
                humanity's sake you suffer now, I do not doubt, every bit as much as the soldier's 
                wounds are for his country's sake. The more precious the more tenderly cherished, the 
                more drawing the hearts that understand, with ineffable yearnings for this.</p>

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their

                    (1843–1894) was a Pre-Raphaelite painter, model and intellectual. She was
                    the daughter of painter Ford Madox Brown (of whom she wrote an unpublished
                    biography) and his first wife, Elisabeth Bromley. She married critic and writer
                    William Michael Rossetti in 1874. An active feminist, she was a signatory of the
                    national petition for women's suffrage and wrote a biography of Mary Shelley,
                    published in 1890. She started suffering from tubercolosis in 1885 and died in
                    San Remo, Italy, in 1894. </span></span> [<a href="#r6123">back</a>]</li><li id="n0114">7. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0114 note" id="n0114"><span>Born in France, Ford Madox Brown (1821–1893)

                    page "Prefatory Notice," Rossetti justified his editorial decisions, which
                    included editing potentially objectionable content and removing entire poems:
                    "My choice has proceeded upon two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every
                    poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings
                    of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include
                    every remaining poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest."
