            <p class="tei_p">Thanks, many thanks, for books that came safely a few hours ago. William was much
                pleased, not only with the gift, but with the bookâ€”type, print, all. I shall try to
                write more fully soon. All about as last Sat. The postal cards and papers all
                welcome. The 4th was a horrid day here. With love from us both.</p>
