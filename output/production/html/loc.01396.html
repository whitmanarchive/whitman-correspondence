                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
