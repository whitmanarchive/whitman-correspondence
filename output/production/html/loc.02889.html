                it dear Friend I can't exactly obey that, for it has been my settled, steady purpose (resting on a deep strong faith) 
                ever since 1869. Nor do I feel discouraged or surprised at what you say of American "crudeness," &amp;c. (of which, in 
                truth, one hears not a little in England.) I have not shut my eyes to the difficulties and trials

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    celebration of the U.S. in 1876, Whitman reissued the fifth edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in the repackaged form of a "Centennial Edition" and
                    "Author's Edition," with most copies personally signed by the poet. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> was published as a companion volume to the
                    book. Notable for its experimentations in form, typography, and printing
                    convention, Whitman's two-volume set marks an important departure from previous
                    publications of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. For more information,
