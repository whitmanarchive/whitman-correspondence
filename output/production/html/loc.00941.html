                    way to visit his brother George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt Whitman
                    stopped in Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk
                    in the office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George
                    had not been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his
                    home until 1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major
                    Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. The identity of Mrs. Cooper is unclear. A
                    Mrs. Cooper is mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's letter of
                        <a href="loc.00940">November 10, 1863</a>, and on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, O'Connor informed Whitman that
                    Eldridge was going to stay at Mrs. Cooper's home in Philadelphia for several
                    days. This is undoubtedly the Hattie B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H.
                    B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting"
                    to Whitman—"from one who has the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">heart</span>—but
                    not the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">head</span>—of a poet, and consequently feels a
                    sincere admiration and reverence for those Gifted Mortals, who possess both"
                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a
                    different Mrs. Cooper on <a href="loc.00569">March 27, 1860</a>; the Mrs.
                    Cooper of Vaughan's letters was the mother of his roommate Robert "Bob" Cooper
                    after Vaughan left Whitman's Classon Avenue apartment. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00941_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_revised tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00941_n2"><span>For a time Whitman lived
                    with William and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
                    to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William O'Connor
                    (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an
                    abolition novel published by Thayer and Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
                    assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he
                    went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who deserved something
                    better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his
                    death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the presence of
                    Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a single-minded
                    fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been
                    equaled. He was the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators
                    who divided people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those
                    who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a
                    posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th
                    century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice
                    blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York,

                    "inventor," in 1865–1866 an inspector in the Custom House, in
                    1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and in 1867–1868 a seller of
                    hairpins. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
