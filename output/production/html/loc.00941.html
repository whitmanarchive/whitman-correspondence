            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks for your long good letter, which I am not going now to answer. I write at the request of Charlie Eldridge who said that he should be too busy to-day to do so, to tell you that he and Mrs. Cooper are to leave here either in the 8 A.M. or the 11 A.M. train on Monday next, for Philadelphia, and he is to remain at her house that night. They want you to leave New York so as to meet them, and stay at her house too.

            <p class="tei_p">Mrs. Cooper has been coaxing, persuading, begging, entreating, commanding even William to go on with them too, but he says he

By the way—he got your letter, &amp; was delighted with it, he said it was worthy to be set in a gold frame &amp; to which Wm. &amp; I assented most heartily.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, we long for you, William sighs for you, &amp; I feel as if a large part of myself were out of the city,—I shall give you a good big kiss when you come, so depend upon it.</p>
