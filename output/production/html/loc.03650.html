            <p class="tei_p">I have had joyful news today; Percy's wife has a fine 
                little boy—it was born on the 10th, and Norah got through well &amp; is doing nicely—so 
                I feel very happy—</p>

                a paper before the "Iron and Steel Institute," on the Elimination of phosphorus from Iron"—which 
                is also a little triumph of another kind for him—for the Council which accepted his paper is 
                composed of eminent English Scientists &amp; eminent foreign ones will hear it.—I need not tell

                you it is indescribably lovely here now—no doubt Kirkwood is the same—the
                light so brilliant and yet soft—the rich autumn tints just beginning to appear—the temperature 
                delicious—crisp &amp; bracing yet genial—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The throng of people is gone—but a few of the pleasantest of the old set remain—&amp; a 
                few interesting new ones have come—among them Mrs. Dexter from Boston, who was
