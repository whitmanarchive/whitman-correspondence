                    [Bucke] went off at 8½ last evn'g—&amp; are
                probably home by this moment—all well when starting—thanks for your
                photos—I dwell upon them long—thanks for the noble underclothing wh' is
                just what I wanted—I thank Mr Hoskins heartily—</p>

                grandfather—apples are coming in ripe &amp; large—had two roasted for my
                breakfast—two visitors just call'd down stairs—didn't see
                them—what they call the "political cauldron" is beginning to bubble &amp;
                agitate all over the United States, as our great Presidential election comes off
                next year, preceded by great blare &amp; all sorts of what we call wire pulling,
                ("fortunate is that country that has no history" says some (?Quakerish) political
                economist—But I don't know)—It is ab't noon—all quiet—&amp;
                I am sitting alone—the Lord bless you &amp; the friends—&amp; love to
                all—</p>
