            <p class="tei_p">I am anxious to obtain through you whatever copies of Engineering reports that you can send me without too much trouble. Particularly would I like to get the "Memoir on Foundations in Compressible soils by Rich Delafield" lately publish[ed] by the Light House Bd.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Such reports are of great use as they show what has been done, and particularly would any report on such a subject be useful to me just now  Mr Davis is associated with me here, and when you can duplicate the copies we would both be thankful</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I must beg pardon for my wholesale style of asking for these things—but being away from all advising engineers and when books on the subject cannot well be had (not worth much when had) I am forced to secure as best I can the records of the experience of others</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Please give my best regards to your wife—hoping that you are all well and again asking pardon for the trouble I may give you I remain</p>

               <span class="tei_signed">Yours very truly Thos J Whitman</span>
