                to see something that never was
                i
                suppose known before in america
                the impeachment) i think it rather
                sad but notwithstanding exactly as
                it should be i suppose the excitement
                at washington is far greater
                than here the copperheads
                here is all
                for fight that a war will be

                the result some great politician
                down town wanted to bet
                yesterday that the impeachment
                would not take place so our
                georgey
                took him up told
                him he would bet him that
                andrew Johnso would be impeached
                in ten hours from that time
                the gentleman backed down
                after putting his hand in his
                pocket to take out his money
                george came home on sunday
                morning very unexpected as
                i dident look for him till next
                saturday he came something about
                the iron of the pipes he rejected
                as unfit) i got your letter walter
                yesterday monday with 5 dollars
                i was glad to have it walt but
                i doo think sometimes you send
                me more than you can afford
                and more than i ought to expect
                but mamma appreciates it if she
                dont make many <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_4">[illegible]</span> walt you
                wrote about your peice in an
                english magazine
                that you got
                50 d in gold its first rate to handle
                gold in these days
                but i want

                to know what peice it was i
                thought of every one and could
                not make out what peice it was
                when you write again i wish you
                would tell me all about it
                but the gold is quite a new thing
                to be paid in these days) i think we
                will get the galaxy and see Ocono<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">rs</span>
                peice
                if its as stupid as his others
                i dont think it will be worth
                25 cts  i dont see into his writing
                such peices as he writes i should
                think him capable of writing
                something more substancial
                a man that can converse as he can</p>

                they all felt the effects of the
                change of climate its affect
                is a kind of diarea he says he
                thinks matty will like it better
