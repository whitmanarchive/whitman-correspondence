                    approvingly to a speech by Thaddeus Stevens just before the vote. George

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                    would have won his bet. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's interest in impeachment was
                    primarily with events of national significance, but she and George were also
                    anxious that impeachment could affect Walt Whitman's employment as a clerk in
                    the office of the attorney general (see her <a href="duk.00520">March 13,
                        20, or 27, 1868</a> letter to Walt). The United States House of
                    Representatives brought articles of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson
                    on February 24, 1868. The precipitating event was the removal from office of
                    Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton (1814–1869) three days earlier ("Letter

                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
