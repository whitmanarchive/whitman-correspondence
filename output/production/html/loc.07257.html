            <p class="tei_p">I am reading Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales" over again—have not looked at
                them for at least 25 years—did not think they were so genuine and good as I
                find them now to be. We had no <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">clergiman​ </span><span class="tei_corr">clergyman​
        
      </span></span> this morning and I have just come in from officiating—reading
                prayers, bible, sermon &amp;c. Since coming from chapel I have spent half an hour
                (as I often do) running over "November Boughs" "The Voice of the Rain," for
                instance, one of the most exquisite parables in the English, or any other language.
                "Robert Burns," I think, a marvellous piece of criticism. "Last of the War Cases"
                one of your most touching pieces, and so on turning the leaves and thinking and
                dreaming.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I thought that by this time I should have been able to say something definite about
                my jaunt east, but I cannot. Wm Gurd has been in N.Y. since Tuesday morning. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00427.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00427.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00427.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> but so far I have heard
                no word from him—I fear something is wrong but cannot think what it
                is—probably it is nothing serious and when I do hear in a few days more the
                hitch may have been then got over. I still hope I may leave here say about two weeks
                from tomorrow (it may possibly be sooner) but I cannot tell whether I shall go
                direct to Philadelphia or to N.Y. first.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our wet weather still continues, it has rained nearly every day since Sept.
                26—the last few days snow with the rain so that the ground has been white at
                times I look for a fine long "Indian Summer" after all this wet, raw, and cold
                weather.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The "Complete Works" takes time, a lot of time, but that is all right—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">take time</span>—enough of it, and have it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right</span>—it is worth taking pains about—it will
                be a standard book for many a day—to many and many it will be a sacred, an
                altogether priceless volume—a bible of the bibles—a resumé of them
                all.</p>
