            <p class="tei_p">I am reading Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales"<a href="#n4173" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4173">2</a> over again—have not looked at
                them for at least 25 years—did not think they were so genuine and good as I
                find them now to be. We had no <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">clergiman​ </span></span> this morning and I have just come in from officiating—reading
                prayers, bible, sermon &amp;c. Since coming from chapel I have spent half an hour
                (as I often do) running over "November Boughs"<a href="#n3999" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3999">3</a> "The Voice of the Rain," for
                instance, one of the most exquisite parables in the English, or any other language.
                "Robert Burns," I think, a marvellous piece of criticism. "Last of the War Cases"
                one of your most touching pieces, and so on turning the leaves and thinking and
                dreaming.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I thought that by this time I should have been able to say something definite about
                my jaunt east, but I cannot. Wm Gurd<a href="#n4284" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4284">4</a> has been in N.Y. since Tuesday morning. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00427.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00427.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00427.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_es.00427.jpg</span> but so far I have heard
                no word from him—I fear something is wrong but cannot think what it
                is—probably it is nothing serious and when I do hear in a few days more the
                hitch may have been then got over. I still hope I may leave here say about two weeks
                from tomorrow (it may possibly be sooner) but I cannot tell whether I shall go
                direct to Philadelphia or to N.Y. first.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our wet weather still continues, it has rained nearly every day since Sept.
                26—the last few days snow with the rain so that the ground has been white at
                times I look for a fine long "Indian Summer" after all this wet, raw, and cold
                weather.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The "Complete Works"<a href="#n6137" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6137">5</a> takes time, a lot of time, but that is all right—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">take time</span>—enough of it, and have it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right</span>—it is worth taking pains about—it will
                be a standard book for many a day—to many and many it will be a sacred, an
                altogether priceless volume—a bible of the bibles—a resumé of them
                all.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
                    outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
                    capital investors."
