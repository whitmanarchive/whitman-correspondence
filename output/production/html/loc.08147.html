                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    couple went to Canada with Richard Maurice Bucke, physician at the Insane Asylum
                    in London, Ontario, and returned to Camden on June 14, 1891. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08060_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.08060_n3"><span>Anne Montgomerie

                    and one son, Wallace (1893–1898). Anne was unimpressed with Whitman's work
                    when she first read it, but later became enraptured by what she called its
                    "pulsating, illumined life," and she joined Horace as associate editor of his
                    Whitman-inspired periodical <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Conservator</span>. Anne edited

                    Horace's death, both Anne and Gertrude edited his manuscripts of his
                    conversations with Whitman during the final four years of the poet's life, which
                    eventually became the nine-volume <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
