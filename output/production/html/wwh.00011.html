        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Hattie,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter, &amp; read it over &amp; over again—it is very, very good—so much about your dear mother, it
        brought the tears to my eyes, &amp; I had to stop many times—my dear, dear Sister
        Martha, she must have suffered so much, &amp; to keep up such fortitude &amp; patience &amp;
        even cheerfulness, while life lasted—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Hattie, I have just got a letter from your grandmother written Thursday afternoon, Feb.
          27, &amp; she had not got your letter then—did you send
        her one a week ago, as you spoke of having written to her? She was very uneasy at not
        hearing from Jeff or any of you, since your mother's death. I wish you to write <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediately</span> to your grandmother, direct to her
        care of Geo. Whitman
              at Starr's foundry
              Camden, N. Jersey
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have got just well enough to go out, in a carriage, but, dear Hattie, I am in a miserable
        condition, as to my power of moving—The doctor says I shall get well, but it is very,
        very slow and irksome—my mind is clear, but I have to sit in my room alone, by the
        fire, most of the time—visitors generally have been prohibited—but only a few
        come in—but now I have ventured out for a few minutes every fair day—It is now
        afternoon, very pleasant, &amp; I shall just get out on the sidewalk &amp; then
        back—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">O how often I have thought of my dear sister Martha, as I have been alone here, both night
        &amp; day—I think of your father too, &amp; of you &amp; California—but here I am, unable to move—I hope Jeff will feel
        like writing to mother, &amp; she will send it to me—As soon as I can travel I think
        of going on to Camden—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dearest Hattie, if we had a house to invite you and California to, how much comfort it
        would be to your grandmother &amp; me—But I have great thoughts—at any rate a
        great desire—to get one, here, when I get well, &amp; have
        grandmother &amp; Eddy here—&amp; then you &amp; California shall
        surely come—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Love to you, dearest Hattie—&amp; love to your dear father, &amp; to
        California—If you can, dear niece, write me again, &amp; dont wait very long, dear Hattie—Hattie dear, you must mind the address—(My
        letters from St. Louis are addressed wrong)—My right address is </p>
