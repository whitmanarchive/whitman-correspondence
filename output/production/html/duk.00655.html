            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got my letter last Saturday, 21st—All goes along at present the
                same old story—nothing new in the office—I shall be glad when Grant
                comes in, &amp; a new Attorney Gen'l appointed—if I weather it out till
                then—though I am well enough off, at present, &amp; probably safe—I
                don't think there is any show for Mr. Evarts<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> remaining here after Grant comes in—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We are having a splendid spell of weather again, after the storm of Saturday
                last—To-day it is very fine—I should like to be with you on
                Thanksgiving, Thursday—I shall take dinner at my boarding house—Mrs.
                    Benedict<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> told me yesterday to bring any of my friends to dinner I wanted
                to—I still have the same room—I make a fire mornings, &amp; have it
                quite comfortable—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Is Jeff home?<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Martha must keep up good
                spirits—I have no doubt she will get all right again<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—I approve
                what you advised her about the wine—it is as George said, you can't get any
                real pure port wine—I shall keep watch of the place in Western Pennsylvania I
                spoke of, &amp; if they have any genuine wine, as I was informed they would in
                January, I shall get some for Martha—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Has George done any thing about the Portland av. house, yet?<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> Write to me all the news. Your letter came last week, &amp;
                was welcome. I am quite busy to-day—have several jobs of work in the office
                that keep me hard at it—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Love to you, dearest mother—&amp; to all—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have had to scratch off my letter in a hurry, but I wanted you to have something,
                according to promise in my last. </p>

                    General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and

                    Whitman complained, on December 14 (?), 1868, that they had not paid for any "provitions" while they stayed in Brooklyn: "i did really think they had ought to
                    give me some [money] but let every thing go but i would ask more than 100$
