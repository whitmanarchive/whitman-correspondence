            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got my letter last Saturday, 21st—All goes along at present the
                same old story—nothing new in the office—I shall be glad when Grant
                comes in, &amp; a new Attorney Gen'l appointed—if I weather it out till
                then—though I am well enough off, at present, &amp; probably safe—I
                don't think there is any show for Mr. Evarts remaining here after Grant comes in—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We are having a splendid spell of weather again, after the storm of Saturday
                last—To-day it is very fine—I should like to be with you on
                Thanksgiving, Thursday—I shall take dinner at my boarding house—Mrs.
                    Benedict told me yesterday to bring any of my friends to dinner I wanted
                to—I still have the same room—I make a fire mornings, &amp; have it
                quite comfortable—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Is Jeff home? Martha must keep up good
                spirits—I have no doubt she will get all right again—I approve
                what you advised her about the wine—it is as George said, you can't get any
                real pure port wine—I shall keep watch of the place in Western Pennsylvania I
                spoke of, &amp; if they have any genuine wine, as I was informed they would in
                January, I shall get some for Martha—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Has George done any thing about the Portland av. house, yet? Write to me all the news. Your letter came last week, &amp;
                was welcome. I am quite busy to-day—have several jobs of work in the office
                that keep me hard at it—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Love to you, dearest mother—&amp; to all—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have had to scratch off my letter in a hurry, but I wanted you to have something,
                according to promise in my last. </p>
