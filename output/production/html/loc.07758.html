            <p class="tei_p">Dark wet &amp; warm (almost) to-day—stay in to-day—yesterday out nearly
                two hours in my wheel chair—have read &amp; sent off the poemet proof to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>, is to be printed I believe in the May
                    number—(Gilder ask'd for a sub-title to it)—it is (did I tell you?) an emotional &amp;
                poetical mention of the immense unknown &amp; unnamed soldiers north &amp; south
                slain in the Secession War—Nothing new—Am ab't as well as
                usual—appetite, digestion, sleep, pulse &amp;c. not notably bad—wh' I
                suppose is quite a good deal to brag of for me—</p>

                following grippe, over 50, has had a funeral ceremony &amp; burial to-day—I
                sent a little ivy woven anchor &amp; white initials, to be laid on the corpse or
                coffin, as I took a notion to, &amp; was acquainted with him—Keep up the
                massages—am sitting here alone in my den—lots of fog here
                lately—My supper is coming—</p>

                "Review" &amp; a French and Italian pamphlet)—have just drink'd a mug of milk
                punch—dull &amp; heavy enough here—read the papers, &amp; read

                flourishing—told me he is ready (&amp; favorable) to take the meter (for gas)
                &amp; make a good big thing for you &amp; Gurd &amp; all—I take it wanted me to tell you—a heavy dark
