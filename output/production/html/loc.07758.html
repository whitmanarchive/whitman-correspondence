                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art

                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
                    would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
                    investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
                    impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
                    "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
                    readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
                    headlines. He died on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Titanic</span> when it sank in
