         <p class="tei_p">It was with exceeding interest that Mr Curtis &amp; I listened to the letter you lately wrote to Dr. Russell, which came to us through my sister Miss Stevenson.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Its effect was to make us desire to aid you in the good work you are engaged in,—caring for the sick &amp; wounded soldiers.  We inclose thirty dollars, &amp; feel very glad to have the opportunity to minister to their comfort.  Mr Curtis

               would send it anonymously, but I think it is pleasant to know where one has excited an interest, &amp; in asking you to acknowledge its receipt, my wish is, most to be sure that it has reached its destination.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">My direction is to care of Charles P. Curtis, Boston.</p>
