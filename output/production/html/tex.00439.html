            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 20th rec'd, ab't Dr Bucke's book. I know something about it, &amp; do not
                object. Dr B. has spent considerable on the illustrations (I have seen them, they
                are quite creditable) has gathered a variety of biographical
                information—criticises my poems from an almost passionately friendly point of
                view (as scientist, student of poetry, medical doctor &amp;c)—&amp; has
                included what as time goes on may prove a curiously valuable collection of
                cumulative opinions on L of G. from 1856 to the present day—&amp; I should say
                it would be a safe publication-enterprise—but you must of course judge &amp;
                decide for yourselves<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Another thing I must broach—hoping you are not alarmed at the District Attorney
                episode, (as I am not at all,) but see your way clear to continue on in
                earnest—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have about got into shape a volume (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">It</span> at least will not be
                liable to any District Att'y episodes—) comprising all my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">prose writings</span> to be called (probably)</p>
            <span class="tei_lg"><span class="tei_l"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span></span>
            <span class="tei_l"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">&amp; Thoughts</span></span>
            <span class="tei_l">by Walt Whitman</span></span>
            <p class="tei_p">to be about same size as L of G. This little Dist. Att'y flurry blowing over, &amp;
                we getting things into good shape—(as of course I suppose <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">it</span> surely will,
                &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">we</span> will)—would you bring it out say late this summer, same terms as L of
                G? In that case there would be three Volumes gyrating together, the L of G—the
                S D &amp; T—and Dr Bucke's book—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Upon the whole, &amp; as my friend seems determined to bring out his book, I hope you
                will take it. I know Dr Bucke well, &amp; have for some years—He is a
                perfectly honorable, reliable solid man to deal with—a linguist, well
                conversant with the best German, French &amp; British poetry—of English stock
                &amp; birth, but grown up in Canada and the California regions of America, &amp;
                combining in my opinion the best traits of both nationalities. He is now &amp; has
                been for some years, (in fact he built up &amp; organized it) at the head of the
                largest &amp; most complete &amp; modernized Asylum for the Insane in
                America—(one of the largest in the world—1000 persons under his
                charge)—near London, Ontario, Canada—Though enthusiastic he has a
                careful eye to practical &amp; business responsibilities—has a fine very large
                family of children—his social, professional, citizen &amp;c reputation, all
                first class in Canada.</p>

                    biography: "We do not know whether the book would appeal to us commercially but
                    we of course prefer not to look at it without first being sure that it meets
                    your approval." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
