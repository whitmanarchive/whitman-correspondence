               <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed $25 is from my old friend Joseph P. Davis who is Engineering down in Peru. Although he is far away yet he does not forget home. I have written him in some of my letters what you were doing, with short extracts from your letters.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well Walt it looks as if we had met rather a bad reverse in the West. If Rosecrans is whipped I should hardly think that the United States was large enough to contain the infernal quacks that administer the military arm of our government. I suppose their is at least 30 000 men <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nibbling</span> around in Kansas and other parts west. Matters that would tumble of their own weight if the army in front of Rosecrans was thouroughly whipped. Tis awful to think of. I mailed you a letter from George a few days since, did you get it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is abt the same as usual. I think she fails somewhat. I suppose not more than we must expect however. Mattie and the babies are quite well. Hattie is getting to be quite a girl, and the little one is also getting to be quite a youngster. Jess is abt the same, he is not well. He needs good living more than anything I think. Andrew I suppose Mother wrote you about  I think that it is unfortunate that he should be so humbuged by the "Italian Dr." but I suppose he would not otherwise have tried to get well at all  The Dr. requirs him to pay $180 in 3 installments in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">advance</span>. He has paid $46 and is now living his 15 days at the "Foriegn Dr's" as a prepairing course, then he is to take certain baths. The whole thing in my opinion is one of the biggest of humbugs. However if Andrew believs in it I suppose it is best to bolster him up in his beliefs.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall write you again [in] a few days sending you some more money. till then good bye</p>
