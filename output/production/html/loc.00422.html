            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed $25 is from my old friend Joseph P. Davis<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> who is Engineering down in Peru. Although he is far away yet he does not forget home. I have written him in some of my letters what you were doing, with short extracts from your letters.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well Walt it looks as if we had met rather a bad reverse in the West. If Rosecrans<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is whipped I should hardly think that the United States was large enough to contain the infernal quacks that administer the military arm of our government. I suppose their is at least 30 000 men <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nibbling</span> around in Kansas and other parts west. Matters that would tumble of their own weight if the army in front of Rosecrans was thouroughly whipped. Tis awful to think of. I mailed you a letter from George a few days since, did you get it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is abt the same as usual. I think she fails somewhat. I suppose not more than we must expect however. Mattie and the babies are quite well. Hattie is getting to be quite a girl, and the little one is also getting to be quite a youngster. Jess is abt the same, he is not well. He needs good living more than anything I think. Andrew I suppose Mother wrote you about  I think that it is unfortunate that he should be so humbuged by the "Italian Dr."<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> but I suppose he would not otherwise have tried to get well at all  The Dr. requirs him to pay $180 in 3 installments in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">advance</span>. He has paid $46 and is now living his 15 days at the "Foriegn Dr's" as a prepairing course, then he is to take certain baths. The whole thing in my opinion is one of the biggest of humbugs. However if Andrew believs in it I suppose it is best to bolster him up in his beliefs.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall write you again [in] a few days sending you some more money. till then good bye</p>

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend of Jeff Whitman's, he became city engineer of
                    Boston (1871–80) and completed his distinguished career as chief engineer
                    of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). For his work

                    Stacke Rosecrans (1819–1898) performed admirably in the Chattanooga

                    disastrous. He was soon relieved of command on the advice of General Grant and

                    repeatedly complained about this doctor (see Jeff's letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00426">October 15, 1863</a>) George and Walt Whitman were
                    willing to let Andrew experiment with him. On <a href="duk.00347">October
                        16, 1863</a>, George wrote Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, "I had a letter from
                    Walt, dated Sept. 28th  he said that Andrew was considerable better and was
                    Doctoring with a celabrated Italian Doctor in Court St. I dont have much faith
                    in them new fangled foreign Doctors, but if Andrew is realy so much better, it
                    is good encouragment to keep on and give him a fair trial" (Jerome M. Loving,

                    October Andrew changed to Dr. John H. Brodie who lived on Myrtle Avenue (Louisa
