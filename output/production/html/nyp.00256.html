                <span class="tei_salute"/>Dearest mother,
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter of Wednesday last all right. I shall begin to look for Jeff, to-morrow—I do hope he will come.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have just changed my quarters—I moved to-day back again to the same house Mrs. Grayson used to live in—it is now occupied by a Mr. &amp; Mrs. Benedict—I have not got my old-room but a room right over it—it is in the attic, it is true, but I think it will be pleasant, &amp; cool in summer—&amp; all the quieter for being in the attic—every thing is new &amp; clean, new bedstead, mattress, &amp;c—I can't tell till I try, but I think I shall like it—that is, as well as one is apt to like 
                any quarters here in Washington—I will write you how I like it in my next—I want Jeff to come &amp; stay there with me—it will be pleasant &amp; comfortable—it is 472 M st. 2d door west of 12th—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, it may be I write kind of sober sometimes, but I have been this winter, 
                &amp; am now, in as good health as usual, &amp; very good spirits—So, brother Jeff, I don't feel a bit "pegged out"—only getting old—most 50, you know—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">We have had another cold spell here, pretty nearly as cold as ever—There is great excitement in Congress—they have night sessions—
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I went to the hospital 
                
                Sunday afternoon last—there is a friend of mine there that got shot at Cold Harbor in June 1864—
                &amp; he has had the bullet in him ever since—it was in a very bad place, the lower part of the stomach, 
                just in the waist—last Saturday he had an operation &amp; had it extracted—it was in, the length of my little finger—it was a very critical operation indeed—but he got through with, &amp; is going to get well, according to all appearances now—There are lots of things left by the war, yet.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope Jeff will not disappoint me—the prospect, as I write, is for pleasant weather—&amp; Jeff can stop with me just as well as not—Love to George and Matty, &amp; all.
            </p>
