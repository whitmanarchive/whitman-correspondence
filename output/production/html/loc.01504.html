                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                        <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>, 299). For more, see Philip W.

                    notice of his lecture on Lincoln, "Death of Abraham Lincoln," which he delivered
                    for the last time on April 15, 1890 in the Arts Room in Philadelphia, where he
                    was part of a reception given that evening by the Contemporary Club. If Whitman
                    enclosed a notice for Dowden with a letter, that letter has not yet been
                    located. For more information on Whitman's lecture, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_427.html">'Death of Abraham Lincoln' (1879)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    John and two sisters, Margaret (six years older than Edward) and Anna, the
                    eldest sibling ("Biographical Note," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Letters of Edward Dowden
                        and His Correspondents</span> [New York: Dutton, 1914], 395–397). Dowden
                    is likely referring to Margaret because he had written to his brother expressing
                    concerns about her health in 1888. See Dowden's letter dated August 20, 1888
                    (238). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
