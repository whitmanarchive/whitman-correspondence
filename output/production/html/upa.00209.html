            <p class="tei_p">I wish you would send a card to say whether you received safely the guinea I sent per money order, as usual for a copy of the Leaves of Grass. I acknowledged the latter, and asked you to let me know when you got the money safely, but as I have not heard from you since I am beginning to fear that it may have gone wrong.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I missed some things from the 'Leaves of Grass' which I expected to find in it. It has three or four poems not in my old copy, but I heard of a poem beginning—"Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm"—which I did not find in this 1876 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="edition​ ">edn.</span>​  nor can it be in the –76 Two Rivulets, as I possess that already. Is there any other collection of poems, not included in these two volumes? If so, I wish you would send it to me.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have been in Dublin for some days and saw Dowden. He is preparing an article on Carlyle for the XIX Century. It is said that in this as in another article shortly to appear by some other author there will be some "damaging" facts revealed  from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Carlyle's​ ">C's</span>​  private correspondence. I pity anyone whose notion of Carlyle is likely to be damaged by any facts that could be revealed. Lilliputians, looking at the great man through a telescope and judging him by the facts, 'damaging' or otherwise which they may have the fortune so to discover!</p>
