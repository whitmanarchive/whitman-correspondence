            <p class="tei_p">I wish you would send a card to say whether you received safely the guinea I sent per money order, as usual for a copy of the Leaves of Grass. I acknowledged the latter, and asked you to let me know when you got the money safely, but as I have not heard from you since I am beginning to fear that it may have gone wrong.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I missed some things from the 'Leaves of Grass' which I expected to find in it. It has three or four poems not in my old copy,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> but I heard of a poem beginning—"Thou who hast slept all night upon the storm"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—which I did not find in this 1876 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="edition​ ">edn.</span>​  nor can it be in the –76 Two Rivulets, as I possess that already. Is there any other collection of poems, not included in these two volumes? If so, I wish you would send it to me.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have been in Dublin for some days and saw Dowden.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> He is preparing an article on Carlyle for the XIX Century. It is said that in this as in another article shortly to appear by some other author there will be some "damaging" facts revealed  from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Carlyle's​ ">C's</span>​  private correspondence.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> I pity anyone whose notion of Carlyle is likely to be damaged by any facts that could be revealed. Lilliputians, looking at the great man through a telescope and judging him by the facts, 'damaging' or otherwise which they may have the fortune so to discover!</p>

                    have been written between February 10, 1881, the date of the preceding letter,

                    receipt. Since Rolleston saw Dowden in Dublin before the publication of the
                    article in the May issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth Century</span>, the

                    (1843–1913), professor of English literature and oratory in Trinity
                    College, Dublin, was a noted scholar at whose home gathered many of the leaders
                    of the Irish Renaissance. Through reviews and personal action, he did much to
                    advance Whitman's cause in the British Isles. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00209_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_frenz tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00209_n5"><span>"Carlyle's Lectures on the
                    Periods of European Culture. From Homer to Goethe," transcribed by Dowden,
                    appeared in the May 1881 issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth Century</span>
                    (9, 856–879). Dowden introduced the article with the following:
                    "'Detestable mixture of prophecy and playactorism'–so in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences</span> Carlyle describes his work as a lecturer."
                    This is the only statement in the article that might be constucted in any way as
                    "damaging" and even this estimate by Carlyle of his own work Dowden refuted. Sir
                    Henry Taylor's essay on the publication of Carlyle's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences</span> is to be found in the same volume. While this contains
                    personal material, the author's attitude is a very sympathetic one. The only
                    other article on Carlyle which appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth
                        Century</span> around that time is J. A. Froude's "The Early Life of Thomas
                    Carlyle" (July 1881), which contains letters but hardly of a "damaging"
                    nature. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
