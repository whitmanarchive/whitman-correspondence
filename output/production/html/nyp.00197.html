            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you must have heard from Ashton that I received Mr. Otto's letter,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> &amp; that I returned for answer that I would report myself to him on or about Tuesday 24th instant. During the week previous to 16th I was quite sick, but this week I am about as well as usual.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I intend to leave here on Monday 23d—shall take the 8 o'clock morning train, which will probably arrive in Washington about 7 in the evening. William, if you could hear of a room, I wish you would engage it for me—if Gwinne<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> has one, it would do—take the first good room you find, if any, irrespective of price—it would do for a week or so, any how—would like convenience for a fire, as I am susceptible to chill this winter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We got word yesterday by means of an exchanged prisoner, from my brother George, but only up to November 27—at that time he was at Danville, Virginia, in confinement with 350 other officers. We hear that he is full of fortitude &amp; even good nature, but like all the rest, starved, miserable &amp; naked, to the last degree.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well, home here. Last night another snow-storm, but fine &amp; sunshiny this morning—So far this winter, snow, rain, mud, melt, fog, with spells of sharp cold. I have received a letter from Charles Eldridge, from an island off in the sea, far beyond Boston. I suppose you got my letter of some ten days since. Nelly, I send you my love, &amp; hope you are well &amp; [in] good spirits. Farewell.</p>

                    William D. O'Connor | Light House Bureau, | U S Treasury Department, |
                    Washington, | D. C. It is postmarked: New York | Jan | 20. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00197_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00197_n2"><span>For a time Whitman lived
                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
                    deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
                    hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
                    presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
                    single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
                    seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
                    the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
                    people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
                    against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
                    collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
                    flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
                    memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton,
                    1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman wrote on <a href="loc.00415">June 13, 1863</a>: "I am
                    real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
                    in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
                    twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
                    there are still people of that kind left." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00197_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00197_n3"><span>William T. Otto was
