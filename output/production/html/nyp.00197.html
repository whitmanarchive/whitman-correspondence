               </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you must have heard from Ashton that I received Mr. Otto's letter, &amp; that I returned for answer that I would report myself to him on or about Tuesday 24th instant. During the week previous to 16th I was quite sick, but this week I am about as well as usual.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I intend to leave here on Monday 23d—shall take the 8 o'clock morning train, which will probably arrive in Washington about 7 in the evening. William, if you could hear of a room, I wish you would engage it for me—if Gwinne has one, it would do—take the first good room you find, if any, irrespective of price—it would do for a week or so, any how—would like convenience for a fire, as I am susceptible to chill this winter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We got word yesterday by means of an exchanged prisoner, from my brother George, but only up to November 27—at that time he was at Danville, Virginia, in confinement with 350 other officers. We hear that he is full of fortitude &amp; even good nature, but like all the rest, starved, miserable &amp; naked, to the last degree.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well, home here. Last night another snow-storm, but fine &amp; sunshiny this morning—So far this winter, snow, rain, mud, melt, fog, with spells of sharp cold. I have received a letter from Charles Eldridge, from an island off in the sea, far beyond Boston. I suppose you got my letter of some ten days since. Nelly, I send you my love, &amp; hope you are well &amp; [in] good spirits. Farewell.</p>
