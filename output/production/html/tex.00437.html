                amount to any thing—but I want you to be satisfied, to continue as publishers

                    withdrawing the same from circulation and suppressing the editions thereof." In

                        4</a>, the firm asked Whitman's "consent to the withdrawal of the present

                    features." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00201_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00201_n3"><span>Whitman was with the
