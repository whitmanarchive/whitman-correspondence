            <p class="tei_p">The precious volume 'November Boughs'<a href="#n3999" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3999">1</a> arrived last night and drew forth an exclamation of delight
                from me as I untied the package at the supper table. The portrait was a real surprise, &amp; I value very highly
                the portrait of E. Hicks,<a href="#n0301" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0301">2</a> a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">remarkable</span> face. A <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">god-smit</span> man of the old heroic stamp.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The mélange of the vol. exhibits a range &amp; strength that I had not tho't
                to be quite so marked, when I read the pieces separately as they came out. The very <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mass</span> is wonderful, considering that they emanate from a
                semi-invalid.</p>

                letter. I devoured the new poems &amp; prose pieces bit by bit, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">stealhily​ </span></span> to-day, having the book (disguised by cover) in my drawer, whence I took
                it out to read from time to time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I notice a deepening shade of the sombre &amp; of pathos throughout the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">latest</span> bits of
                poetry. But it is better so: it completes your picture of a typical man—a man
                complete, clear through the "opiate" shades to the gates of death.</p>

                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the
                    Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until
                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in

                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
