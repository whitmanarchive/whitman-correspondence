                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    married Henry Shell Harned (1818–1906) in 1848. The couple had at least
                    four sons: Henry Harned (1849–1934), Thomas Biggs Harned
                    (1851–1921), Frank Harned (1855–after 1930), and John Frederick

                    Camden, New Jersey. Thomas B. Harned, one of Whitman's literary exectuors, said
                    of his mother: "She was a great woman, with unusual mental qualities. In many

                    Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several

                    Gardener, 1896), Kennedy writes that on November 8, 1890, Whitman sent a brief
                    memorandum to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Transcript</span> office for
                    publication. Whitman's "'jotting'" commented on the election of 1890, which was
                    held during Republican President Benjamin Harrison's term of office (Harrison
                    served from 1889–1893). Republicans suffered major losses in the election,
                    with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives, but with
                    Republicans hanging onto control of the Senate. Kennedy quoted Whitman's piece
                    in full: "Walt Whitman likes the result of the late election, and wants more of
                    it. Though an old Republican, he calls the party in power 'the banditti
                    combine,' and says, if it were not for American elections as safety-valves, we
                    should likely have a French Revolution here and Reign of Terror" (39). In this
                    letter, Whitman is referring to the publication of this piece in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Transcript</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4195">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4195 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4195"><span>Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to

                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span>—in December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made
