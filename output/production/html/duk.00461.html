                but walt i felt bad i cant write it perhaps
                its better to not the greatest hardship for me
                is to be compeled to be pleasant to one you
                dislike han
                 has every thing to live on provitions by the quantaty
                and nice place but she has few cloths only what
                she fixes over she keeps house very nicely
                and is very forbearing puts up with every
                thing) i got your letter walt the only one
                i have received since i have been here i
                got the money too what you sent me before
                i came and since i came i have written to matty and george
                and jeffy and havent had any letter from
                any of them han is much better she says than
                she has been and sends her love to you and
                wants you to come here very much indeed
                she wants to see you and wants you to see
                a place for sale across the lake at
                Birmingham
                ½ miles from keesville and 3 miles
                from port kent the line of steamboats run
                from new york and stops at port Kent and
                so to burlington) this place at birmingham
                was very active in time of the war with factories
                nail and other factories but since the war there
                is not much business but a man that lives
                there told me very much about it

            the house and ground around it
                is 400 dollar he said the house and by his tell
                the ground must be very cheap he said there
                was fruit and the ground very good indeed
                and spring of water there is a steam boat
                runs from here several times a day
                50 cent acrost han says if you will only
                come she will doo ever so much to make

                speak of is in new york state on the map
                i suppose han thinks you must buy it
                and settle down and get married
                i suppose the lake is very beautiful
                this gentleman that spoke to me about it
                said they didint feel as if they were very
                far from new york i wont write any
                more about that) but how i doo want to
                see the young ones
