                    visited Whitman on November 10, and informed the poet that his father was "quite
                    unwell," Whitman sent "an affectionate letter" and a small bottle of whisky to
                    Mr. Stafford (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commonplace Book</span>, Charles E. Feinberg

                    Washington, D.C.). On <a href="loc.03963">November 13</a>, Harry urgently
                    suggested that Whitman come immediately to Kirkwood. During his stay there from
                    November 14 to 17, Whitman learned that George Stafford suffered from stomach
                    hemorrhages—hematomesis (see Whitman's letter to Edward Carpenter on <a href="duk.00743">November 27, 1877</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00166_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00166_n3"><span>Since Herbert Gilchrist
                    walked to Kirkwood on November 4 and returned on the following day, Harry wanted
                    him to be informed of his father's condition (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Commonplace
                        Book</span>). Herbert and Harry, however, were not on amicable terms (see
                    Whitman's letter to Harry on <a href="nyp.00406">August 7, 1877</a>). On
                        <a href="loc.03969">October 24</a> Harry complained to Whitman: "H. G.
                    is down yet, he will be down for several days by the way he talks. him and our
                    folks get along well, Mother thinks him tip top, and it makes her mad if I say
                    any thing against him. she told me the other day if I did not want to sleep with
                    him I could go somewhere else for she was not going to keep a bed for me by
                    myself." Evidently the two young men were later on better terms, for, according
                    to Harry's letter to Whitman on <a href="loc.03972">November 7</a>,
                    Herbert invited him to spend the weekend with the Gilchrists. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
