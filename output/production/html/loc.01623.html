                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Son Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new with me—I continue about the same—my general strength the best 
                it has been yet—I go out a little most every day, but it is very cold weather here—I was quite <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="nonplussed​ ">non-plus'd</span>​  at that affair in Bergazzi's with Frank Rives—who is he? Is he some one I know? Was he drunk or loony? tell me more of it—what he said—the exact words—It seems unaccountable to me—from what I gather 
                from your letter you did exactly right. If I hadn't met with some queer characters myself—&amp; been the subject of such strange &amp; unaccountable remarks—I should hardly think any thing of the sort possible—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have occupied myself lately writing—have sent a letter to the Graphic, describing the Capitol, 
                which they have accepted, and may publish Saturday or Monday. Have also written a poem which I have sold—will send you one when it appears.—As I write this holding the paper on my lap 
                I am sitting here in the parlor, by the heater—have had my dinner—drank quite a goblet of wine, 
                which I believe has flown into my head. (My brother west, &amp; another friend here, 
                have both sent me presents of good wine—&amp; I drink it occasionally, half water—but this time I have taken a little extra)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete, I thought I would send you a couple of shirts—so I have ordered them made here, 
                got as near <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01623.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01623.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01623.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>the measure as I could—they will be done in some ten days, perhaps less, 
                &amp; then I will send them. I like mine so well, I have had yours made like them, with collars on. 
                I have had no new togs made this winter. I wear my old gray suit, &amp; the old black overcoat,—&amp; when very cold, or stormy my gray shawl—If you should see me now leaning against Milburn's 
                counter, you wouldn't <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">see any difference from last winter</span>—(but my heart tells a different story)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have been in all day, &amp; must get out a little—the evenings are the most tedious 
                with me—I can manage to put in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the days</span>, but these long <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cold evenings</span>, I think if 
                I only had the right quarters in Washington, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my own quarters &amp; a good wood fire, 
                &amp; you with me as</span> often as possible, I should be comparatively happy</p>
