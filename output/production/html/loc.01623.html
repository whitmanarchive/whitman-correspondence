                from your letter you did exactly right. If I hadn't met with some queer characters myself—&amp; been the subject of such strange &amp; unaccountable remarks—I should hardly think any thing of the sort possible—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have occupied myself lately writing—have sent a letter to the Graphic, describing the Capitol, 
                which they have accepted, and may publish Saturday or Monday.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Have also written a poem which I have sold<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—will send you one when it appears.—As I write this holding the paper on my lap 
                I am sitting here in the parlor, by the heater—have had my dinner—drank quite a goblet of wine, 
                which I believe has flown into my head. (My brother west, &amp; another friend here, 
                have both sent me presents of good wine—&amp; I drink it occasionally, half water—but this time I have taken a little extra)—</p>

                I have had no new togs made this winter. I wear my old gray suit, &amp; the old black overcoat,—&amp; when very cold, or stormy my gray shawl—If you should see me now leaning against Milburn's

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt
                        Whitman</span>, ed. Emory Holloway (1921), 2 vols., 2:42–49. Editorially
                    the newspaper commented: "Walt Whitman's prose is as remarkable in its way, as
                    is his poetry, and is characterized by the same curious rhythm and same wealth
                    of color. . . . The public will be glad to learn that Mr. Whitman has in a great
                    degree recovered from his recent illness—an illness which had its origin
                    in the exposures undergone by Mr. Whitman in the army, and which at one time
                    threatened his life. Though not yet as strong as he hitherto has been, he is
                    still well enough to resume in a measure his duties at Washington and to wield
                    his pen with as much effectiveness as ever." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01623_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01623_n3"><span>"Song of the
