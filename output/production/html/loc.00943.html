                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship
                    with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the
                    Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen
                    defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate
                    residence. The correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous
                    as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship

                    Beach," but it had really been written by her husband, Calvin Beach. Expecting a
                    favorable response, the editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>,
                    Henry Clapp, Jr., had forwarded a copy of Whitman's book to Juliette Beach for
                    review. Her husband, however, angered that Clapp had sent the book to his wife,
                    appropriated it and wrote a scathing review, which was published in his wife's
                    name. In a letter to Clapp dated June 7, 1860, Juliette Beach explained the
                    nature of the mistake and expressed her regret at not having had the opportunity
                    to publish her own favorable opinion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.
                    In an attempt to undo some of the damage, Clapp printed a notice titled
                    "Correction" in the subsequent issue of his newspaper, alongside three positive
                    commentaries on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> by women. (For Calvin
                    Beach's review of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00039.html">Leaves of Grass</a>.") Ellen O'Connor contributed her bit to the theory
                    that Beach and Walt Whitman had a love affair when she asserted that "Out of the
                    Rolling Ocean, the Crowd," published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, was
                    composed for "a certain lady" who had angered her husband because of her
                    correspondence with the poet (Emory Holloway, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</span>, [Garden City, New York:

                    letters to Walt Whitman, which later Burroughs vainly asked Mrs. Beach to print;
                    see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life and Letters of John Burroughs</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1925), 1:120. If these were love letters,
                    Walt Whitman hardly treated Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings discreetly. See also

                    Mullery referred to the kindnesses of a Miss Howard while he was in the
                    hospital, and another soldier, Charles H. Harris, on <a href="nyp.00163">May
                        30, 1864</a>, asked to be remembered to Miss Howard and her sister. On

                    preceeding fall, and recalled "the Same Sad Smile on her countenance" (Library
                    of Congress). Probably these were the Misses Sallie and Carrie Howard listed in
                    the 1866 Directory, or the Miss Garaphelia "Garry" Howard, one of Whitman's
                    Washington friends, mentioned in Jesse Mullery's letter to Walt Whitman from
                        <a href="nyp.00174">November 26, 1864</a>. According to Whitman's
                    "Hospital Book 12" (Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress), Sergeant Jesse
                    Mullery, Company K, Fifteenth New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital,
                    on May 14, 1864. The twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball
                    in lung—(ball still probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June
                    23, 1864, he went home to Vernon, New Jersey, on furlough, and then served as
                    assistant cook in the army hospital in Newark. On December 26, 1864, Mullery
                    proposed a visit to Brooklyn. He was still at the Newark hospital on January 23,
                    1865. According to his letters of <a href="nyp.00178">May 3, 1865</a>, and
                        <a href="nyp.00179">June 11, 1865</a>, he later was able to return to
                    active duty. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00943_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00943_n7"><span>George Wood
