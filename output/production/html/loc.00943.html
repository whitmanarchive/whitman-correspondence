                </span>
          <p class="tei_p">It will be two weeks to-morrow since you left us, and I have missed you terribly every minute of the time. I think I never in my life felt so wholly blue and unhappy about any one's going away as I did and have since, about your going. I began to be really superstitious I felt so badly. I did not think that you were going to die, but I could not possibly overcome the feeling that our dear <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00943.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>and pleasant circle was broken, and it seemed to me that we four should not be together any more as we have been. But now since you are so much better, I hope you will come back to Washington in the autumn to stay all winter, and I hope we shall spend a part of every day together, as we have so many days. Ah! Walt, I don't believe other people need you as much as we do. I am
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sure</span>
                    they don't need you as much as

                    do. William says it seems <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00943.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>so desolate since you left,—and even yet in the evening when I hear a car coming, I find myself watching for you, and listening for you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One reason that I have not written to you before is that I have been so unhappy I thought my letter would only make you so. I can't possibly tell you what a gap you have left, and how all seems gone since you left.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William got your note, and answered it but he directed it to Brooklyn only, so it may not be carried to your house, &amp; <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00943.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>you may have to look after it. Charlie got your letter to him, &amp; answered it the same day. He went off last Friday to pay the Staff Officers down at the front in the 5th Corps, Warren's &amp; he said he wished you were here to go with them, as it would give you a fine chance to see your brother George. He expected to get back yesterday, but we have not seen him yet.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Poor Ashton is sick in bed with rheumatism, a fearful attack of it, &amp; he is hourly expecting his brother to be sent-up, who has been badly <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00943.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00943.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>wounded in the arm &amp; neck, but I have promised him that if his brother arrives before I leave, I will go &amp; see him.

            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our affairs remain as they did when you left, &amp; that is one cause of my delay. I know that William prefers &amp; I do, too, that this trouble concerning the house &amp; hall be settled before I leave, but I think I must go this week at any rate.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Irvinton made us a visit on Sunday. He is now located here, as you may know. He looked sick, &amp; says he is. He has had chills &amp; fever, caught in the James River.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I asked Miss. Howard about Jesse Mullory, &amp; she says he was sent to New York before you left Washington, but she says he was

            <p class="tei_p">The fourth was rather a dull day to me, the only satisfaction I had was in helping Mr. Wood pack his trunk, Jeannie &amp; I spent two hours with him in the morning, helping him, as he was to leave to-day.
