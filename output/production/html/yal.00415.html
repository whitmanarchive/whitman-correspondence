      <p class="tei_p">Mother dear, I suppose you got the letter Tuesday—I am about the same—I have not gone over to the office to-day, &amp; am writing this in my room—mother, I send only $15 in this—will send the other 5 in my next—Write and send me word, soon as convenient after you get this—I have not been feeling so well this forenoon, but feel better now—As I said before I have ups and downs—but steadily advance, quite certain, though very slowly—I seem to have a bad cold in my head—I am going to try to go out in the car, 
        as the day is so pleasant and bright—</p>
