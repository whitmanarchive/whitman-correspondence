                    29, 1863. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only Wednesday. The
                    executors did not assign a date, and Edwin Haviland Miller appears not to have
                    been aware of the letter (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    1:373). The letter must follow George Washington Whitman's <a href="tex.00119">April 22, 1863</a> letter to his brother Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. George, writing from Lexington, Kentucky, described
                    his regiment as "encamped at Winchester about 16 miles from here" and reported
                    that he had sent $350 to his mother. According to Louisa's letter, Jeff
                    received a letter from George the previous Monday, and she echoed George's
                    statement on his location and the amount of money sent. Therefore, Jeff received
                    George's April 22, 1863 letter two days before this letter was written. George
                    forwarded pay for soldiers in his regiment on April 19: his role in the process
                    is corroborated in an April 23, 1863 letter in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                        Sunday Mercury</span>. Also, Louisa addressed two matters from Walt Whitman's
                    most recent letter: he sent shinplasters (currency of a small denomination) and
                    inquired whether Henry D. Howell had visited (see his <a href="loc.00767">April 28, 1863</a> letter to Louisa). Louisa acknowledged Walt's letter
                    here. Therefore, this letter dates to the Wednesday that followed George's April
                    22, 1863 letter to Jeff and Walt's April 28, 1863 letter to Louisa: April 29,
                    1863. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                        George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                        the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
                        Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                        Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
                        and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
                        later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as

                    larger sums of money both during and after the war, but Walt Whitman generally
                    sent his mother smaller sums via the postal service. George Washington Whitman
                    was repaying in installments a loan that Walt had made to him when George was
