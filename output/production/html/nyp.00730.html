            <p class="tei_p">Y'r good letter with the £5 has reached me, &amp; I
                have sent off to-day the books &amp; pictures by the International Express (Adams's)
                address'd the same as this letter, (as the package was too big for mail)—Send
                me word when it reaches you in good order—also
                what the expressage freight charge was—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling pretty well at present, but have had a bad winter—have had <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the grip</span> &amp; a second attack—was out yesterday four
                or five miles, to the bay shore &amp; linger'd some time by the water side—eat
                &amp; sleep middling well—in good spirits—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dr Bucke is here temporarily—is well—shall probably
                get out this fine afternoon in wheel-chair—have kind attention—I send
                you my last piece—</p>

                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you &amp; best wishes &amp; remembrances to British
