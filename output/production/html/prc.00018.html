            <p class="tei_p">I have now ready the prose article—(will make, I should think, about 14
                printed pages)—which I mentioned to W. F. Church,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> at an interview here not long since.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I cannot give you any complete description of the piece—but will say that
                it takes up the subject of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span> where the article by
                that name in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> of December, left it—and
                applies to Individuality—sketches the portrait of the ideal American of
                the future—also characterizations of the American
                woman—overhauls the Culture theory, shows its deficiencies, tested by any
                grand, practical Democratic test—argues that the main thing wanted for
                the literary, esthetic, &amp; moral areas of the United States is to institute
                what must result in copious supplies, among the masses, of healthy, acute, handsome
                Individualities, modernized, &amp; fully adapted to our soil, our days, city
                &amp; country. The name of my piece is <span class="inline_quote">

                    </span>
                </span> Don't be alarmed at the (perhaps at first sight) oddity of the word<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—it is the right
                title for the article, and will justify itself, &amp; remain.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The piece is a following up of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span>—&amp;
                is, as a literary performance, I think better than that paper—&amp;
                will arouse more attention. Of course there is nothing in it which you would demur
                to print in the magazine.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Are your plans such that you would probably like the piece for your April number?
                Could you print it positively as the leader? Please give me definite &amp;
                immediate answers. The piece is all ready.</p>

                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
                    York newspapers until he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army and Navy
                        Journal</span> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
                    he established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866. Financial control of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William
                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
                    Francis wrote for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> the unsigned piece
