        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I sent you the Weekly Graphic No. 2 yesterday—wish you to take an opportunity, when convenient, 
        &amp; loan it to those two dear ladies, Mrs. Johnson &amp; her sister mentioned in my article<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—&amp; please give them my best remembrances. Dear Nelly, how are you getting along, this winter?—We have just had a snow storm here—cold &amp; while, as I look out, and the sleigh-bells 
        occasionally jingling by—I am sitting here alone in the parlor by the heater, 
        as I write. I am alone most of the time, (to all intents &amp; purposes.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I feel that I am better, in the main—yet still have daily &amp; nightly bad spells in the head, 
        &amp; my leg most of the time disabled as ever. In fact not much different from the same old story—(yet certainly a good streak, or vein, of encouragement, &amp; feeling of encouragement—maintaining itself—accumulating—never more than temporarily leaving me.) 
        I even begin to think about coming back to Washington &amp; trying it again.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I sent a P.O. check for $50 to Charley last Friday to pay my young man<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—haven't <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  any word from Charley yet, up to this present writing<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—hope it came safe—may hear from him, this afternoon or tomorrow. Charley 
        is always so prompt in responding. I hear regularly from Peter Doyle—he is well &amp; hearty, works hard for poor pay, on the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Baltimore​ ">Balt</span>​  &amp; Potomac <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Railroad​ ">RR</span>​ ., 
        works nights a great deal. He writes me regularly every week. I have been 
        waiting ever since I wrote,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> to get the photos. of my nieces, (my dear sister Mat's girls,) returned from New York, &amp; send them to you—but have not yet got them. Shall write for them. My "song of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the redwood tree</span>," 
        in last Harpers is copied a little, &amp; abused &amp; sneered at in the newspaper criticisms, 
        a good deal, (from what I glean)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of course</span>, that last makes me feel <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very bad</span>—I expect to have another piece in February<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> Harpers—(but am not certain)—"prayer of Columbus"—as I see it now I shouldn't wonder if I have unconsciously put a sort of biographical dash in it—Nelly dear, write oftener—put in all the gossip &amp; items that will be next best to seeing you—do you see Dr. Drinkard—I sent Garaphelia Howard<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> a paper, the Graphic<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> that has my picture—how is she? Is she married? Give her my love—Poor, good Mr. Dille<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>—yet amid all its sombreness &amp; terror how blessed to die "by touch ethereal," 
        painless, instantaneous—Nelly, death has become to me a familiar thing—Yet, as I sit here writing, 
        I do not feel a particle less of life in me, than ever.
      </p>
