                The couple had at least twelve children, and the family was living in Howard Lake, Minnesota, a few years before William's death. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n4097b">1. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_n4097b tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4097b"><span>"After the lapse of over 8 years," William
                    Stansberry, a former soldier whom Whitman had met in Armory Square Hospital,
                    wrote on <a href="duk.00765">December 9, 1873</a>, from Howard Lake,
                    Minn., and recalled "the Blackbery [Jam?] you gave me &amp; all the kindness
                    which you shown." Whitman's reply on April 27, 1874 is lost, but Stansberry 
                    wrote again on <a href="duk.00767">June 28, 1874</a>, thanking Whitman for
                    his letter and "22 News Pappers." On <a href="duk.00764">July 15, 1874</a>, his wife informed
                    Whitman of her husband's failing health and poverty and inquired about the
                    possibility of a pension. Evidently in reply to another lost letter from
                    Whitman, Stansberry asked on <a href="duk.00768">July 21, 1875</a> for
                    "the Lone of 65$" in order to return to West Virginia, where he expected to
                    find witnesses to support his application for a pension. This was evidently the
                    last letter in the correspondence. These letters are in the Trent Collection,
