               Your card of the 27th of September<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a> reached me along with the parcels of books. Thanks
               many &amp; hearty for your prompt attention to my requests, dear Walt Whitman. The big

               you had taken a start for the better; but I must not assume more than the

                    Harry Buxton Forman, was most notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley
                    and John Keats. On <a href="loc.01619">February 21, 1872</a>, Buxton sent
                    a copy of R. H. Horne's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Great Peace-Maker: A Sub-marine
                        Dialogue</span> (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying
                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
                        of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</span>, which exposed Forman as a

                    Burroughs (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.
                    C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to
                    become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically
                    drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two men is, as
                    Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write
                    several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on
                        Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
