                Quiet day—All goes well as usual with me—am sitting here 
                same—Sarrazin has gone to New Caledonia 
                a French colony, where he has a post (magistrat) at town of Nouméa—has 
                written to me, nothing new or important seems 
                to keep up his view of L of G.— 
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                —Y'r letters rec'd—John Burroughs has sent me a good basket of grapes, &amp; the word is that he will soon come 
                himself—meanwhile he seems to be working &amp; flourishing there on his fruit farm on Hudson river shore—no word very 
                lately f'm the Smiths who are probably all down doing happily in the country at Haslemere (dear Mrs: 
                Gilchrist's country)—Herbert is still out at Centreport, 
                Suffolk Co: Long Island—was here in N J ten days ago, but did not call on me—Horace comes daily, 
                is very good to me—is cooking up the piece all ab't me for Boston N E Magazine "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">W W at date</span>" 
                (good title I say) collating all sorts of concrete &amp; personal bits <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> literary criticism (first rate)—

            <p class="tei_p">
                The 50 big books have been box'd up &amp; sent off to England—have eaten oysters my meals several times 
                lately they are good, plenty &amp; cheap here now, (&amp; for coming season)—Mrs: D cooks 
                them to just suit me—agree with me markedly—Enclose J W Wallace's letter lately rec'd (can send photo: 
                of him &amp; friends on a card if you care to have it—I have two such cards)—
            </p>

                —Did I tell you I am composing a prose piece under the name of "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Old Poets—(and other things)</span>"—don't 
                know what I sh' make of it—moderately short—ab't 2½ as I close this—Shall lie down now a little—in ab't two 
                hours have my supper &amp; then get out an hour two in wheel chair—
