                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    letter to Bucke of <a href="loc.08047">April 14, 1891</a>, the poet writes
                    that Horace Traubel has just sent Bucke "a full set (66p) '<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Good-Bye</span>' annex." <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> (1891) was

                    commenting on poetry, aging, and death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems

                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
                    1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
