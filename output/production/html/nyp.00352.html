                    <p class="tei_p">This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South, bet 4½ &amp;
                        6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Aug | 21 | N.J.; Carrier
                        | 22 | Aug | (?)."</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The dating of this postcard as well as the notes and letters to Doyle on <a href="nyp.00350">July 31</a>, August <a href="nyp.00351">7</a>, <a href="loc.01658">14</a>, and <a href="loc.01650">28</a>, 1874, depends in part on Whitman's habit of writing on
                        Fridays. However, as evidenced in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00353">August
                            5</a> letter to Ellen O'Connor and his <a href="nyp.00354">August
                            18</a> letter to John and Ursula Burroughs, both of which were
                        conclusively written in 1874, Whitman's "alternations" were especially
                        marked during the summer of this year, and despite his "natural buoyancy" he
                        was frequently depressed by the inability of his once healthy body to
                        triumph over his ailments.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00352_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00352_n2"><span>According to his <a href="nyp.00354">August 18, 1874</a> letter to John and Ursula
