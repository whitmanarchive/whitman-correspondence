            <p class="tei_p">Your magazine with the article on my book has safely reached me—&amp; a second copy in sheets—also your last letter. I only write now to make prompt, brief acknowledgment. I have gleaned a general knowledge of the article, &amp; it pleases me very much. I have seen Clemens Petersen in New York, &amp; he ran over it for me. He has been very ill with erysipelas, but is now nearly well.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am to return to Washington in two or three days. I will write to you thence more fully, &amp; hope to continue having letters from you—My address will be Solicitor's Office, Treasury.</p>
