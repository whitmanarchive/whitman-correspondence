                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letters have reached me. I cordially accept your appreciation, &amp; reciprocate your friendship. 
                I do not write many letters, but like to meet people. Those tender &amp; primitive personal relations 
                away off there in the Pacific Islands, as described by you, touched me deeply.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">In answer to your request, I send you my pictureâ€”it was taken three months since. I also send a newspaper.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Farewell, my friend. I sincerely thank you, &amp; hope some day to meet you.
            </p>
