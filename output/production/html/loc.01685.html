            <p class="tei_p">Your letters have reached me.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I cordially accept your appreciation, &amp; reciprocate your friendship. 
                I do not write many letters, but like to meet people. Those tender &amp; primitive personal relations 
                away off there in the Pacific Islands, as described by you, touched me deeply.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>

            <p class="tei_p">In answer to your request,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I send you my picture—it was taken three months since. I also send a newspaper.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Farewell, my friend. I sincerely thank you, &amp; hope some day to meet you.

                    (1843–1909) published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>, edited by Bret Harte,
                    in 1867. His most famous book, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">South-Sea Idyls</span> (1873), is
                    mentioned in Walt Whitman's <a href="loc.01686">April 23, 1870</a> letter
                    to Stoddard. He was a journalist, a lecturer at the Catholic University of
                    America from 1889 to 1902, and for a brief period Mark Twain's secretary. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01685_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01685_n2"><span>Stoddard's first letter
                    was written on <a href="loc.01942">February 8, 1867</a>, when he was about
                    24; he requested (or beseeched) an autograph. When he wrote again on <a href="loc.01943">March 2, 1869</a>, he was in Honolulu, and passionately
                    implored an answer. Fascinated with the "Calamus" theme, Stoddard began a
                    correspondence with Burroughs; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 48. See also

                    typical native village: "The native villagers gather about me, for strangers are
                    not common in these parts. I observe them closely. Superb looking, many of them.
                    Fine heads…Proud, defiant lips, a matchless physique, grace and freedom in
                    every motion. I mark one, a lad of eighteen or twenty years who is regarding me.
                    I call him to me, ask his name, giving mine in return. He speaks it over and
                    over, manipulating my body unconciously, as it were, with bountiful and unconstrained love. I go to his
                    grass-house, eat with him his simple food. Sleep with him upon his mats, and at
                    night sometimes waken to find him watching me with earnest, patient looks, his
                    arm over my breast and around me." After listening to Horace Traubel read this
                    letter, Walt Whitman commented: "Occidental people, for the most part, would not
                    only not understand but would likewise condemn the sort of thing about which
                    Stoddard centers his letter" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.42.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996],
