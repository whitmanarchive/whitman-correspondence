                spend the winter with us—the next question is shall I go to Philadelphia for
                you or meet you at the Falls? You can get a train by which you can run through to
                the Falls without change so that there would not be any difficulty in coming that
                far alone if you were feeling pretty well (I must caution you however about talking
                too long to those goodlooking girls at Homersville as you might get left). But would it not
                be as well (or necessary) for me to go to Philadelphia to arrange for the
                publication of my book<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in the Spring? Or can you arrange this without me? And if I
                do not go myself will it not be necessary to send the M.S. with copies of the
                illustrations?
                Let me know at your earliest convenience what you think of all this: We are all well
                and Mrs. B., as well as myself, is much pleased at the prospect of seeing you so soon—don't disappoint us.</p>
