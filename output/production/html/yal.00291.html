            <p class="tei_p">Your letter was very welcome to me. Your hand-write looks
                as clear &amp; strong as ever. I hope it really denotes that you are much better.
                The other night I read a long time in your "Specimen Days" &amp; got myself into a
                very melancholy state of mind thinking of the old times, of all that Washington life

                    O'Connor &amp; of that which never can come back. My life
                now seems very pale &amp; poor compared with those days. There are but two things
                now from which I derive any satisfaction, Julian &amp;
                that bit of land up there on the river bank where I indulge my inherited love for
                the soil. I have no comrades here. I probably never shall find any more. Julian is
                developing into a very happy, intelligent boy, full of enthusiasms, full of
                curiosity, &amp; is about my only companion.

            <p class="tei_p">I am greatly distressed at what you tell me about O'Connor, and one must stand by
                powerless to render any aid! I hope I can see my way to go to W again to see
                him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall not stay here in P. much longer. I am getting enough of boarding house life.
                I shall go back home by March, but Mrs B &amp; Julian will stay
                here. I had a letter from Horace this morning. The book may be
                sent to me at West Park, &amp; let me thank you in advance for it. Tell Horace the

                the magazines from time to time. What of Gilchrist? When you
