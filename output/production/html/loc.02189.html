                    George Stafford (1827–1892) were the parents of Whitman's young friend,
                    Harry Stafford. Whitman often visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek
                    in Laurel Springs (near Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by
                    Herbert Gilchrist; in the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
