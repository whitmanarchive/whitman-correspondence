                    (1847–1925) was a member of the Royal Navy and educated at Brighton
                    College. Carpenter was part of a distinguished naval family, the son of
                    Commander Charles Carpenter (d.1882) and father of Vice-Admiral Alfred Francis
                    Carpenter (1881–1955). For his service with the Marine Survey of India
                    during the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885, he became the first naval officer to
                    receive England's Distinguished Service Order. For more information, see his
                    obituary in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Journal of the British Astronomical

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    "spiritual democracy" and how to achieve a more just society. The work was
                    influenced by Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Bhagavad Gita</span>, the work of Hindu scripture. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">England's Ideal: And other papers on Social Subjects</span> was
