            <p class="tei_p">I continue getting along pretty well considering—Eat my rations &amp; sleep
                fairly—(the Graham biscuits taste good—have them most every meal—I
                only take two meals daily)—the publisher got an order for 250 copies <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: Boughs</span> yesterday from Scotland—the enclosed (I send to George) was forwarded to me by Capt. Wright—(I don't know what he wants George's address for—have not written
                myself)—Coolish, dark, rainy here to-day—I am sitting here yet by the
                stove in my sick room. The big book (all my writings collected complete) will be
                done in ab't a fortnight—I shall send you one—</p>
