                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    and referenced the Baconian theory of Shakespere authorship. Additionally, Bucke
                    described his longing to spend time discussing the subject with Whitman's friend
                    and defender William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), who had authored the book

                    century, a variety of scholars began to speculate on the question of the
                    authorship of William Shakespeare's plays. A favorite theory was that Francis
                    Bacon, the English philosopher, actually wrote the plays and left behind a
                    series of clues or ciphers in his letters and journals. Whitman was evidently
                    never very interested in this theory but he did publish an essay, "What Lurks
                    behind Shakespeare's Historical Plays," in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> on
                    September 27, 1884. On <a href="med.00808">August 30, 1887</a>, he wrote a
                    letter to Bucke, William Sloane Kennedy, and John Burroughs in which he mentions
                    reading an extensive article on the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy in the August
                    28th issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York World</span>. In the letter he wrote,
                    "I am tackling it—take less and less stock in it," and the result was
                    Whitman's poem "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00030.html">Shakespeare Bacon's Cipher</a>," which was published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Cosmopolitan</span> in October 1887. </span></span> [<a href="#r3043">back</a>]</li><li id="n4188">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4188 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4188"><span>Whitman often referred to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span> (1888) as his "big book." The
                    volume was published by the poet himself in an arrangement with publisher David
                    McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves

                    1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding
                    decisions, and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo
                    of the poet on the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom,

                    under that title by McKay in 1891, along with a prose "Preface Note to 2d

                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
