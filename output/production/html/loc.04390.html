                    letter, he was visiting the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke at Bucke's
                    home in London, Ontario, Canada. Wallace had traveled to the United States from
                    Bolton, England, landing at Philadelphia on September 8, 1891 (Horace Traubel,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.210.html">Tuesday, September 8, 1891</a>). After spending a few days with Whitman,
                    Wallace traveled with Bucke to Canada, where he met Bucke's family and friends.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was a well-known Polish actress, particularly famous for playing Shakespearean
                    heroines. In 1878, Whitman met Modjeska while visiting with writer and editor
                    Richard Watson Gilder (1844–1909). The poet later said of the actress,
                    "She is a fascinating, bright woman. I have never seen her act—saw her at
                    Gilder's, in New York—handsome, agreeable, magnetic" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.143.html">August 28, 1889</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r1031">back</a>]</li></ul>
