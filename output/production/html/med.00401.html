            <p class="tei_p">You have overlooked one thing. When I called upon you 2d January, we found a discrepancy in the two lists of sheets on hand—yours had it that Sheet B, 2d consisted of only 225 sheets—while my list had it that Sheet B 2d consisted of 325 sheets—I wish you to carefully count sheet B 2d &amp; inform me how many there are—as it will decide how many of the deficient signatures of "Drum-Taps" etc., I will require to finish up the edition. Please acknowledge the reception of this, with check.</p>
