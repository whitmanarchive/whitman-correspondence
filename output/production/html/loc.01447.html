            <p class="tei_p">I was right glad to hear of you again through the medium of the newspaper, you so
                kindly sent me, I have been thinking of writing you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">afew​ </span><span class="tei_corr">a few​
        
      </span></span>
                lines these months past, only I was afraid your illness would

      </span></span> 
                feeling any interest in one so far away as me, and I also felt so deeply for you 
                that I did not like to disturb the repose you seemed to need from your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Duty</span>. 
                the enclosed papers will show you the use I have made of the paper, so that other 
                English friends of yours should also learn the good news from Camden. Hope these few

                Chapters upon you and your work may make your work and you more known to our working 
                Classes the periodical in which they were published as principally its main subscribers 
                amongst them. the writer of them is a fellow of deep sympathy and has contributed from 
                time to time some fine feeling and Sympathetic articles to its pages. the first one I 
                noted was on W.Blake our Poet Artist of whom

      </span></span> has 
                written of so nobly and so well. I post these by letter (and send also two by newspaper 
                Post,) so that I may feel somewhat certain some of them will reach you. I had some hopes 
                of seeing you in our land, and 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01447.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01447.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01447.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                was delighted beyond measure when I saw in our papers our Tennyson 
                had written to invite you to visit him, I also feel glad to be enabled to inform you 
                that W.M. Rossetti's Edition has been 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all sold</span>. 
                and the 1872 are subscribed too by our English Publisher has also met with a good sale, 
                of course in a way that is not very complimentary to English appreciation of your Work. 
                I.E. by being sold in what is termed the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"remainder sale"</span> of 
                course my own feeling respecting this is, it gives to people of small means an opportunity
                to possess a Book they 
                otherwise would never have, "so out of evil cometh forth <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good</span>" 
                so saith the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Old Book</span></p>

            <p class="tei_p">last year I was down at oxford at the time Emerson was there, I had 
                no opportunity to speak to him of you, 
                that is I did not think it wise to open the question at the times when I saw. I would 
                gladly have done so, only I was not quite certain how he felt towards you, so as he did 
                not name you out anytime I was in his company as a listener at Max Muller's, 
                I thought it best to be silent, and while at oxford I wandered through the Marketplace 
                (for I love to mingle with all kinds of my fellow men, but I most especially love country 
                folk, fisher folk, and hard workers amongst our people I dearly love to mingle with and we 
                chat in their ways, and to enjoy a kind feeling of sympathy one with the other on these 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">occassions​ </span><span class="tei_corr">occasions​
        
      </span></span>.) well while I wandered here 
                and there I saw a stout wellbuilt man in a small shop selling paper and when I looked at 
                his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wares</span> I saw thereon your Family name, so felt a desire to 
                talk with him. I bought some paper then had some talk and he said the only persons he 
                Knew bearing the name lived at Egham in Surrey and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">where​ </span><span class="tei_corr">were​
        
      </span></span> 
                mostly Market Gardners. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01447.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01447.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01447.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                and one branch of the family had been Stewards to the Duke of Richmond, and one had emigrated 
                to America some distant relation of his family years ago, but they had never heard any 
                news of them—so when I told him there was such a name in America owned by a family 
                there and one of them was a poet, he thought perhaps it might be possible you 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">where​ </span><span class="tei_corr">were​

      </span></span> 
                of that distant relative. he was quite a build of man like you, a noble large bodied and 
                large featured man, full of seeming good honest purpose in his nature, and more like a 
                farmer <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">then​ </span><span class="tei_corr">than​

                Stationer, so that he did honour to the Stock, though not exactly 
                in his trade. he was a type of man I like to see, only he seemed rather confined in his 
                ideas of Books.—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent to him some small notice of you and your work, from Chambers paper, but I never 
                received any reply, so feel afraid your work is not of a kind to suit his tastes. I note 
                also recently your Poem on Lincoln has been read in London at a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Liberary​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Library​

                Association, so slowly though I suppose and hope certainly will you become known to us 
                more widely and truly. Well I must conclude this rambling note, with a hearty wish that 
                you will be once again, able to do some more work for our race and help on the Life, that 
                our hope is! yet shall <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">be</span>. Ruskin is also working hard too to 
                help on a nobler life, and one not much unlike the one you also long to see. so many souls 
                labouring for one end must someday effect the accomplishment of the "Golden Days" so long 
                sung, so long toiled for, prayed for—and fought for!!</p>
