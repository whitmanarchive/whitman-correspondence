            <p class="tei_p">last year I was down at oxford at the time Emerson<a href="#n1044" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1044">8</a> was there, I had 
                no opportunity to speak to him of you, 
                that is I did not think it wise to open the question at the times when I saw. I would 
                gladly have done so, only I was not quite certain how he felt towards you, so as he did 
                not name you out anytime I was in his company as a listener at Max Muller's,<a href="#n0426" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0426">9</a> 
                I thought it best to be silent, and while at oxford I wandered through the Marketplace 
                (for I love to mingle with all kinds of my fellow men, but I most especially love country 
                folk, fisher folk, and hard workers amongst our people I dearly love to mingle with and we 
                chat in their ways, and to enjoy a kind feeling of sympathy one with the other on these 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">occassions​ </span></span>.) well while I wandered here 
                and there I saw a stout wellbuilt man in a small shop selling paper and when I looked at 
                his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wares</span> I saw thereon your Family name, so felt a desire to 
                talk with him. I bought some paper then had some talk and he said the only persons he 
                Knew bearing the name lived at Egham in Surrey and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">where​ </span></span> 
                mostly Market Gardners.

                to America some distant relation of his family years ago, but they had never heard any 
                news of them—so when I told him there was such a name in America owned by a family 
                there and one of them was a poet, he thought perhaps it might be possible you

                large featured man, full of seeming good honest purpose in his nature, and more like a 
                farmer <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">then​ </span></span> a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">humbl​ </span></span>

                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His

                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    page "Prefatory Notice," Rossetti justified his editorial decisions, which
                    included editing potentially objectionable content and removing entire poems:
                    "My choice has proceeded upon two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every
                    poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings
                    of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include
                    every remaining poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest."
