                beloved book, in those greatest moments you have spent alone with it—that was a new joyful experience, 
                a fresh kind of communing with you.—I went to Wales because I felt anxious about Percy, who is not happy
                just now. I must not tell friends here about it (except his brother &amp; sisters but I am sure I may tell you,
                for you will listen with sympathy. He has attached himself very deeply, I think it will prove, to a girl, &amp; 
                she to him, whose parents welcomed him cordially to their house for a year or two &amp; allowed plenty of
                intercourse till they became aware, through Percy himself who thought it right

                Norah's<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">3</a> response to them) that there was a strong affection growing up between the two. 
                Then they peremptorily forbad all intercourse,—not because they have any objection to Percy—quite 
                the contrary they say; but solely and simply because he is not yet earning money enough to marry on, &amp; 
                they hold that a man has no right to engage a girl's affections 
                till he can do so. As if these things could be timed to the moment the money comes in! Percy

                as the friend to whom he tells all—far from being any separation as sometimes happens this love 
                of his seems to draw us closer together. Only I am very, very anxious for his sake to see him in a better
                berth—they would let her marry him on £300 a year; now he has only £175. He is quite competent 
                to manage iron or copper or tin works, only he looks so young, not having yet 
                any beard or moustache to speak of. That is the end of my long story.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
