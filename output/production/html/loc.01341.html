            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Altho I am busy this evening, I must find time to send you word of how very, very
                much we enjoyed seeing Mr. Quincy Shaw's Millet pictures this morning. Your note I believe gained for Mr. Clifford
                permission to go and see them, and papa, Logan and I went with him. I hardly ever
                spent such a delightful morning, and the remembrance is almost as good as the
                reality was. And, best of all, Mr. Shaw invited Logan and myself to come over <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01341.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01341.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01341.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01341.004_large.jpg</span>any time, and
                spend quiet, free hours among his beautiful collection. It added not a little to our
                pleasure this morning to be with a man who knew and loved the artist so well, and we
                all feel very grateful to you for the pleasure of the morning. Mr. Clifford showed us
                his sketch of you. We liked the cheery expression—but were not entirely satisfied
                with the picture.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Logan and I will be home soon—for Thanks giving. Papa said "What shall we do to
                celebrate your vacation and make you have a good time"—"Pursuade Mr. Whitman to come
                over!" I said. Well, we certainly <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01341.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01341.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01341.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01341.005_large.jpg</span>shall see you, even if the Daimon doesn't approve of
                your coming to Germantown—But I hope he will be in a complaisant mood!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter from Mr. Costelloe (one of the Englishmen who came over with me to see
                you), and he asked me to tell you that he read the little book you gave him to the
                passengers on the steamer going home, and that both reader and audience enjoyed it
                sincerely, and were much enlivened and strengthened by the "wonderful faith and hope" that
                breathed through the poetry. You certainly <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">do</span> 'blow grit'
                into people!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I must not make my letter longer—I shall look forward to seeing you soon,
                and I hope you will be well.</p>

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
