                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of March 1873, Walt Whitman stressed that he was
                    slowly, gradually regaining his health. Nonetheless, he acknowledged on March 13
                    that "the principal trouble is yet in the head, &amp; so easily getting
                    fatigued—my whole body feels heavy, &amp; sometimes my hand" (Edwin

                    O'Reilly remains a mysterious figure. Jeff is obviously flustered in writing
                    about her—he repeats "in regard" five times in two sentences—and he
                    clearly intends to hide something. This woman may have been married to the
                    O'Reilly conected with Henry J. D'Arcy (see <a href="loc.00469">Thomas
                        Jefferson Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 24 February 1873</a>), but
                    this is conjecture. See <a href="loc.00472">Thomas Jefferson Whitman to
