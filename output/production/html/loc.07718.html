                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    on this date. Whitman is referring to "The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree" from
                    the Bible, which is found in the book of Luke, Chapter 13, Verses 6–9, and
                    the quote is from Verse 7. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07713_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.07713_n2"><span>On October 18, 1889,
                    Whitman sent a cluster of poems entitled "Old Age's Echoes" to Henry Mills Alden
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span> and asked $100
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.]). On
                    October 24, Alden rejected the work: "It is too much of an improvisation for our
                    use. I had it set up, hoping that, seeing it in type, I might come to a more
                    favorable impression of its form. The thought is worthy of a more careful
                    texture in its parts &amp; of a more shapely embodiment as a whole. I am not
                    critisizing. Criticism has no place in the poet's world. I am writing only as a
                    Magazine editor with reference to Magazine requirements." Alden's letter cannot
                    be located. On November 2, 1889, Whitman sent the piece, now called "Old Age
                    Echoes," to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth Century</span> and asked £20; the
                    editor, James Knowles, returned the manuscript on <a href="loc.03209">February 21, 1890</a>. The "3 or 4 sonnets poemets," as the poet
                    characterized the work in his Commonplace Book, were eventually published in the
                    March 1891 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Magazine</span>. Here, the poem

                    Winter," "The Unexpress'd," "Sail out for Good, Eidólon Yacht!" and "After
                    the Argument." "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">To the Sun-Set Breeze</a>" appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's

                    Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief

                    again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
                    chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
                    St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
                    to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
                    educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
                    Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
                    (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington

                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
