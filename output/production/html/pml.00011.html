            <p class="tei_p">As I know you would like to hear from me, my dear friend, I will not yet go to bed—but sit down to write to you, that I have been here in Boston, to-day is a fortnight, and that my book is well under way. About a hundred and twenty pages are set up—it will probably make from six to seven hundred pages, and of a larger size than the last edition. It is to be very finely printed, good paper, and new, rather large-sized type. Thayer &amp; Eldridge,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> the publishers, are a couple of young Yankees—so far very good specimens, to me, of this Eastern race of yours. They have treated me first rate—have not asked me at all what I was going to put into the book—just took me to the stereotype foundry, and given orders to follow my directions. It will be out in a month—a great relief to me to have the thing off my mind.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am more pleased with Boston than I anticipated. It is full of life, and criss-cross streets. I am very glad I [have] come, if only to rub out of me the deficient notions I had of New England character. I am getting to like it, every way—even the Yankee twang.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Emerson called upon me immediately, treated me with the greatest courtesy—kept possession of me all day—gave me a bully dinner, &amp;c.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>
I go on the Common—walk considerable in Washington street—and occupy about three hours a day at work in the printing office. All I have to do, is to read proofs. I wish you lived here—I should visit you regularly every day—probably twice a day. I create an immense sensation in Washington street. Every body here is so like everybody else—and I am Walt Whitman!—Yankee curiosity and cuteness, for once, is thoroughly stumped, confounded, petrified, made desperate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Let me see—have I any thing else to say to you? Indeed, what does it all amount to—this saying business? Of course I had better tear up this note—only I want to let you see how I cannot have forgotten you—sitting up here after half past 12, to write this precious document. I send my love to Helen and Emmy.</p>

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
                    the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's Monthly</span> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
                    deeply." For more information on Whitman and Abby H.
