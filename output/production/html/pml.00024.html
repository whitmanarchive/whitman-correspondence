                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your first letter of about a month ago, (March 9)—I enquired of a
                friend in the revenue office, about the tax under the new law, &amp; whether ruffles
                would be exempted, &amp;c.—&amp; on or about the 11th March, I wrote you, what I had
                learned—viz: that they were to be exempted—&amp; also all the gossip
                &amp; news, about the O'Connors, &amp; about myself, literary matters with me, and
                how I was situated here, and about things in general—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of
                    course</span> a mighty interesting letter it must have been—and a dreadful
                loss not to get! for I infer by your second letter April 7, just rec'd, that you did
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> get it—which I deeply regret, for I don't like
                to be supposed capable of not responding to those that are almost the same as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">my own folks</span>—(I put both the old &amp; new No's on the
                address—perhaps that made it miscarry,) but let that go—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The changes in the Attorney Gen's office have made no difference in my
                situation—I have had the good luck to be treated with "distinguished
                consideration" by all the Attorney Gen's—Mr. Speed, Mr. Stanbery, &amp; the present
                one Mr. Browning—I couldn't wish to have better bosses—&amp; as to the
                pleasantness &amp; permanency of my situation here, it is not likely to be affected,
                as far as at present appears, unless Wade, coming in power, should
                appoint Harlan, or some
                pious &amp; modest Radical of similar stripe, to the Attorney Generalship—in
                which case, doubtless, I should have to tumble out.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My dear friends, I often think about you all—Helen &amp; Emily in particular,
                &amp; wish I could look in upon you, Sunday afternoons—I warmly thank you for
                your hospitable offers—Give my best respects to Mr. Arnold &amp; Mr.
                Price—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall have a piece in the Galaxy for May—it will be called
                "Personalism"—is a continuation of the piece on Democracy—shall have a
                poem soon, (perhaps in May No.) in the Broadway magazine—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am well as usual—the Impeachment is growing shaky—it it a doubtful business—I am writing this at my
                table in office—as I look out it is dark &amp; cloudy with a chill rain, but
                the grass is green &amp; I see the river flowing beyond. With love,</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I saw William &amp; Ellen O'Connor last night—told them I should write you
                    to-day—Both charged me to send you their love—little Jenny is well
                    &amp; active. I send you a newspaper same mail with this.</p>
