      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">The interval of some weeks, (or is it months?) since I last wrote you has passed on, bringing no decided change 
        in my condition—in my bad spells, (&amp; I have them often enough) I 'most think the end is not far off—but I get over them &amp; my natural buoyancy reässerts itself—(&amp; in the main keeps control of the helm)—though to a man of my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lazy-activity</span> this whole condition &amp; sickness of mine is very wearing—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">To-day I am feeling very comfortable, sitting here in the front room by the open window writing this—eat this morning quite a respectable breakfast, beefsteak, bread, &amp; tea—&amp; at about 3 shall make a light, 
        moderate bite of dinner—no supper—I find I get along best with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">one pretty fair-meal only</span>, 
        &amp; that I make breakfast—The gastric &amp; dyspeptic trouble has been serious, &amp; is perhaps so yet—pains in left side, distress in head, &amp;c—the old story—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">John Swinton came down from N.Y. &amp; spent Sunday with me—told me lots of N.Y. newspaper news, 
        &amp;c.—it was a very welcome visit to me.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I was discharged from my clerkship on the last of June, by B. Wilson, the new Solicitor of the Treasury—(it is all right)—All questions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">what I shall do</span> are to me so subordinate to the question of whether
        I shall soon or ever get well, (or partially well,) that I hardly entertain them seriously—I enclose you Tennyson's latest letter to me—also a slip Swinton gave me—Send them both back in your next letter—Eldridge is in Boston on his vacation—I expect a visit from him in about 12 days, on his way back—Best love to you both, &amp; I shall be with you yet, I have no doubt.
