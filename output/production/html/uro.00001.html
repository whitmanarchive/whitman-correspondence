               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nat
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you were here if only to enjoy the bright &amp; beautiful weather we are having here now for about two weeks—then it is sufficiently cool, &amp; the air buoyant &amp; inspiriting—dear friend, how long it is since we have seen each other, since those pleasant meetings &amp; those hot spiced rums &amp; suppers &amp; our dear friends Gray &amp; Chauncey, &amp; Russell, &amp; Fritschy too, (who for a while at first used to sit so silent,) &amp; Perkins &amp; our friend Raymond—how long it seems—how much I enjoyed it all. What a difference it is with me here—I tell you, Nat, my evenings are frequently spent in scenes that make a terrible difference—for I am still a hospital visitor, there has not passed a day for months (or at least not more than two) that I have not been among the sick &amp; wounded, either in hospitals or down in camp—occasionally here I spend the evenings in hospital—the experience is a profound one, beyond all else, &amp; touches me personally, egotistically, in unprecedented ways—I mean the way often the amputated, sick, sometimes dying soldiers cling &amp; cleave to me as it were as a man overboard to a plank, &amp; the perfect content they have if I will remain with them, sit on the side of the cot awhile, some youngsters often, &amp; caress them &amp;c.—It is delicious to be the object of so much love &amp; reliance, &amp; to do them such good, soothe &amp; pacify torments of wounds &amp;c—You will doubtless see in what I have said the reason I continue so long in this kind of life—as I am entirely on my own hook too.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Life goes however quite well with me here—I work a few hours a day at copying &amp;c, occasionally write a newspaper letter, &amp; make enough money to pay my expenses—I have a little room, &amp; live a sort of German or Parisian student life—always get my breakfast in my room, (have a little spirit lamp) &amp; rub on free &amp; happy enough, untrammeled by business, for I make what little employment I have suit my moods—walk quite a good deal, &amp; in this weather the rich &amp; splendid environs of Washington are an unfailing fountain to me—go down the river, or off into Virginia once in a while—All around us here are forts, by the score—great ambulance &amp; teamsters' camps &amp;c—these I go to—some have little hospitals, I visit, &amp;c &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nat, your good &amp; friendly letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome—I had not thought you had forgotten me, but I wondered why you did not write—What comfort you must take out there in the country, by the river—I have read your letter many times, as I do from all my dear friends &amp; boys there in New York—Perkins lately wrote me a first-rate letter, &amp; I will reply to it soon—I wish to see you all very much—I wish you to give my love to Fritschy, &amp; Fred Gray—I desire both to write to me—Nat, you also, my dear comrade, &amp; tell me all about the boys &amp; everything, all the little items are so good—should Charles Russell visit New York, I wish you to say to him I send him my love—I wish you the same to Perk, &amp; to Kingsley &amp; Ben Knower—So good bye, my comrade, till we meet, &amp; God bless you, dear friend—</p>
