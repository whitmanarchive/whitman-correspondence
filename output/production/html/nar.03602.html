          <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I respectfully ask to substitute the services of the bearer <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walter Godey</span>, in the office, 
        for the present, instead of my own—having made an arrangement with him to that effect, 
        if permitted by you. He writes a good hand, and I think would soon get broke in, 
        and prove efficient. I would ask you to put him at my desk and give him a trial—on some letters first, before giving him the books—(or any other work or arrangement thought best.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have had a tedious time but I seem to be now decidedly though slowly 
        recovering and hope to be in Washington before long.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
