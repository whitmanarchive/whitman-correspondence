                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

                    a preface for a collection of tales by her husband, the late William Douglas
                    O'Connor, which she hoped to publish—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Brazen Android
                        and Other Tales</span> (later entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Three Tales</span>).
                    After the poet's approval was conveyed to her through Bucke, Mrs. O'Connor wrote
                    on <a href="loc.03001">June 1, 1890</a>: "Your name &amp; William's will
                    be associated in many ways, &amp; this loving word from you will be a comfort to
                    me for all time." Not having heard directly from him, she wrote about the
                    preface once more on <a href="loc.03002">June 30, 1890</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n0119">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0119 note" id="n0119"><span>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
