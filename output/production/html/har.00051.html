                    been the editor at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> when Whitman
                    published there in 1860. Unbeknownst to Whitman, however, James T. Fields,
                    partner in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic's</span> publisher Ticknor &amp; Fields,
                    took over the editorship of the magazine in May 1861 as a cost-saving measure.
                    The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span> did not publish a list of its editors, and
                    Whitman subsequently submitted the poem "1861" on <a href="prc.00004">October 1, 1861</a>, to Lowell in error. The letter here submits two
                    additional poems, unfortunately unidentified. Later, Whitman received an
                    impersonal reply dated <a href="loc.00585">October 10,
                    1861</a>—signed only "Editors of the Atlantic Monthly"—returning
                    "the three poems with which you have favored us, but which we could not possibly
                    use before their interest,—which is of the present,—would have
                    passed." Horace Traubel questioned Whitman about this rejection many years
                    later, but Whitman could not remember any of the poems he had submitted, only
                    that he had been puzzled by Lowell's reason for their rejection. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
