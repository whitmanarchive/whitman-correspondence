                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Harleigh Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey, on March 30, 1892, four days after his
                    death, in an elaborate granite tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of
                    Philadelphia built the tomb, at a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion
                    of these costs with money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet
                    could purchase a summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's
                    literary executor, Thomas Harned. For more information on the cemetery and

                    of Commons in 1901 and 1902. He later practiced medicine in London, and he wrote

                    Lynch's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Modern Authors: A Review and a Forecast</span> (1891).
                    In this book, Lynch claims that Whitman's "Emotional Calibre is second to none"
                    (41–44), that he was "not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cultured enough</span>" but had
                    an "eminently virile mind" (85–87), that he "is a new Columbus"
                    (123–127) and a moral poet (171–172). He concludes: "The great
                    pioneer is a vital Ausgangspunkt" (188). Lynch is quoted briefly in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893), ed.

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
