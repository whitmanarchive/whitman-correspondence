               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother gave me the enclosed letter to send you some days since but I forgot to mail it till now. We received your letter<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> last night. The money from George came all safe  I sent you another letter from George about last Monday, also sent George a letter with the money in it. Andrew has been away in the country but returned yesterday, very much worse.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> He came in to see me this morning and it has made me feel quite down-spirited.  He can neither eat nor drink without the greatest agony. He looks very thin and emaciated. I think that if I had the same sickness that I could get the best of it,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> but Andrew seems to put his whole faith in thinking that some Dr can give him something that will set him all straight. I am going to see the Dr with him this P.M. and I also want him to consult Ruggles<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> if he will. I fear the worst for Andrew. I wish you was on here. I think that your advice would be a great thing for him. Cant you come. You speak of coming home. I wish you could come just now. Mother is of course much worried about him. Nancy dont seem to amount to much when trouble comes. You would hardly know Andrew. He is thin weak and generally sickly looking  We have heard nothing from Han lately that I know of  Mother and Heyde keep writing letters to one another but what about I know not. At last the great draft has come and gone and I was not one of the elected. I feel thankful  In our ward the screws were put rather tight. out of a little over 3000 names they drew 1056 nearly one in three, while in other wards the proportion was 1 in 6 and 1 in 7 and in the 9th ward 1 in 10. Tom Geere,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> Tom McEvoy,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> Pat Hughes<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> two or three in Amermans<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> house, were all hit. It seems to have avoided the Water Works, only one or two out of the whole 40 or 50 employed were hit while in Husted &amp; Carls store<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> 7 out of 10 were taken. If this is the last of it I feel thankful but I believe Uncle Abe left off some on account of Seymour,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> if so I suppose there will be another spurt. However we wont worry till the time comes  The enclosed $5 is from Mr Moses Lane.<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have what remains of [three?] old Reg. on the hills by our house. They are fine looking and well behaved men, and look as if they would do their duty any where. If you was home you could have grand times talking with them  One Reg. is from Min. one from Mich. and one from Ohio. What do you think about coming to Brooklyn  I think you better, for awhile any way. I wish you would write to Andrew. He seems to feel wonderfully cast down  Aint the Administrat[ion] got wit enough to see that now is the hour to end the war by whipping the rebels. Dont they know enough to know that unless it is ended in 6 months they will have a hard time to get men to fill the places of what they have now. I fear not.</p>

                        Whitman, September 5, 1863</a>, is a problem. In the first of these Jeff
                    incorrectly says that Setember 5 is a Wednesday; actually the fifth was a
                    Saturday. One might assume, then, that both letters were written on Wednesday,
                    September 2, if it were not for Walt Whitman's comment that he received letters
                    from Jeff dated the third (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    1:143). Perhaps both letters were written on Thursday, September 3, 1863. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00420_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00420_n2"><span>Walt Whitman to Louisa

                    Whitman of August 31 (?) Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote: "Andrew has gone to
                    place called freehold...he went last monday as far as suffron station" (Trent
                    Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special
                    Collections Library). Andrew's drinking with Jim Cornwell on this trip
                    apparently worsened his health. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00420_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00420_n4"><span>Jeff was not merely
                    making an off-hand statement praising his own will and constitution. To judge
                    from scattered references in Hannah's undated letters, Jeff was very sick for a
                    short time in the mid-1850s (Heyde, Hannah [Whitman] Collection, Library of
                    Congress). While it is impossible to determine the exact nature of Jeff's
                    illness, he seems to have suffered from severe depression, loss of appetite, and
                    eventually emaciation. Since this was a period of vocational crisis for Jeff,
                    the symptoms suggest that his illness was psychosomatic. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00420_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00420_n5"><span>The Brooklyn physician
                    Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
                    especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
                    practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
