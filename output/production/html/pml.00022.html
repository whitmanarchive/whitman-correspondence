                of E. Godkin,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> 130 Nassau st. &amp; see if you can get me two or three copies

                &amp;c. I think it must be the paper for June 22—(though it may be June 29—or June 15)—but you must look &amp; see—Godkin is the American agent.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am well as usual—work in the same office—all goes on the same in the office 
                &amp; generally. Mother has moved to 1194 Atlantic street—(not av.)—opposite Hamilton st. You take Fulton av. cars. Ellen O'Connor is 
                going for the summer to coast of Rhode Island—her little girl Jenny 
                is afflicted with bad swellings &amp;c of joints—appears to be scrofulous—William O'Connor is well—</p>
