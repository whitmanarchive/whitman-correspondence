            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Will some of you, the first time you go down town, stop at office (or shop) 
                of E. Godkin, 130 Nassau st. &amp; see if you can get me two or three copies 
                of a new paper, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Chronicle</span>, with a piece about <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> 
                &amp;c. I think it must be the paper for June 22—(though it may be June 29—or June 15)—but you must look &amp; see—Godkin is the American agent.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am well as usual—work in the same office—all goes on the same in the office 
                &amp; generally. Mother has moved to 1194 Atlantic street—(not av.)—opposite Hamilton st. You take Fulton av. cars. Ellen O'Connor is 
                going for the summer to coast of Rhode Island—her little girl Jenny 
                is afflicted with bad swellings &amp;c of joints—appears to be scrofulous—William O'Connor is well—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">How are you all? Write me a good long letter—tell me all the news—all about the girls, &amp; Mr. Arnold—&amp; the last from Arthur, &amp; every thing—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">So good bye for this time—I send you my love, dear friend, &amp; same to the dear girls—&amp; to all.
            </p>
