                <span class="tei_salute">Dear son Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">It is still the same old story with me—the best I can say is that I dont seem 
                to get worse, even if I don't get better. Your letter came—and the Star, with the item about Tasistro. It must be very hot there in Washington, 
                but you stand it better than most any one I know. I too never used to think any thing 
                of heat or cold, from 20 to 50—but last summer I felt the heat severely, for the first time.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete, as I have told you several times, I still think I shall get over this, 
                &amp; we will be together again &amp; have some good times—but for all that it is 
                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01745.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01745.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01745.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01745.002.jpg</span>
                best for you to be prepared for something different—my strength cant stand 
                the pull forever, &amp; if continued must sooner or later give out—Now Pete don't begin to worry boy, or cry about me, for you havn't lost me yet, 
                &amp; I really don't think it is likely yet—but I thought it best to give 
                a word of caution, if such a thing should be—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I am quite comfortable here &amp; have every thing I want—I went out at ½ past 5 
                yesterday afternoon, &amp; rode in the cars here to the ferry, &amp; crossed the Delaware 
                from Camden to Philadelphia four or five times—very pleasant. To-day 
                is burning hot, but I am feeling as well as usual.
            </p>

                to bear as in Washington—I am feeling about as usual to-day—shall try to get out a few steps, after I send this—Good bye for this time dear loving son.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
