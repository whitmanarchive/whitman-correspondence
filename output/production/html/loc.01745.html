                <span class="tei_salute">Dear son Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">It is still the same old story with me—the best I can say is that I dont seem 
                to get worse, even if I don't get better. Your letter came—and the Star, with the item about Tasistro. It must be very hot there in Washington, 
                but you stand it better than most any one I know. I too never used to think any thing 
                of heat or cold, from 20 to 50—but last summer I felt the heat severely, for the first time.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete, as I have told you several times, I still think I shall get over this, 
                &amp; we will be together again &amp; have some good times—but for all that it is 
                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01745.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01745.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01745.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                best for you to be prepared for something different—my strength cant stand 
                the pull forever, &amp; if continued must sooner or later give out—Now Pete don't begin to worry boy, or cry about me, for you havn't lost me yet, 
                &amp; I really don't think it is likely yet—but I thought it best to give 
                a word of caution, if such a thing should be—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I am quite comfortable here &amp; have every thing I want—I went out at ½ past 5 
                yesterday afternoon, &amp; rode in the cars here to the ferry, &amp; crossed the Delaware 
                from Camden to Philadelphia four or five times—very pleasant. To-day 
                is burning hot, but I am feeling as well as usual.
            </p>

                to bear as in Washington—I am feeling about as usual to-day—shall try to get out a few steps, after I send this—Good bye for this time dear loving son.
