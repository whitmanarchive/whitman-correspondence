            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are enjoying this splendid, sunshiny weather as much as we are—the atmosphere here is delicious.<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">1</a> In the morning Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">2</a> and I set at home busy with needle work, letter writing, and reading. After lunch we go out for a walk or to pay visits—and of an evening very often to receptions (but they are not half so jolly as our evenings at Philadelphia). Still we have a lively, pleasant time. I like Miss Booth<a href="#n3017" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3017">3</a> very much, with her kindly, generous character and active practical mind. So I do Mrs. Croly<a href="#n1507" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1507">4</a>—she is more impulsive and enthusiastic. Kate Hillard<a href="#n0302" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0302">5</a> often goes with us, &amp; she is always good company. I had a note from Edward Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">6</a> the other day brought by a lady who had been living near him at Sheffield—an American lady with two very fine little girls who has lately lost her husband in England and was on her way back to her parents' home in Pennsylvania—somewhere beyond Pittsburg. She is one who loves your poems, &amp; has great hopes of seeing you in New York. She told me her little girls were so fond of Carpenter he of them—he is first rate with children. I hope you will not put off coming to New York till we are returning to Philadelphia, which will be some time in May. I find Beatrice<a href="#n0260" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0260">7</a> is so anxious to get further advantages for study in England or Paris before she begins to practise, and Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">8</a> is so strongly advised by Mr. Eaton,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">9</a> of whose judgment &amp; experience he thinks very highly, to study in Duron's Studio in Paris for a year, that I have made up my mind to go back, for a time at any rate, this summer; but I shall leave my furniture here, and the question of where our future home is to be, open. Herby is making great progress. I wish you could see the head of an old woman he has just painted—and I wish he had had as much power when he had such splendid chances of painting you. I cannot tell you how vividly and pleasantly Chestnut St. on a sunny day rose before me in your jottings. Love from us all. Tell your sister I often think of her &amp; shall enjoy a chat ever so.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    close friend, the women's rights activist Abby Price
                    (see Whitman's <a href="pml.00040">September 9, 1873</a>, letter to

                    on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
                    Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
                    writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his <a href="duk.00657">June 23,
                        1873</a>, letter to his friend, the former publisher and fellow clerk Charles Eldridge. Hillard and Whitman first met in

                    discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that I never
                    half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed it.
                    To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
                    reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and continue
                    beyond." </span></span> [<a href="#r0302">back</a>]</li><li id="n0141b">6. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0141b note" id="n0141b"><span>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
