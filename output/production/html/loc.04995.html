                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
                    Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
                    volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>
                    (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,

                    (1809–1894) was a poet, physician, and well-known essayist. His son,
                    Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. (1841–1935), was appointed a Supreme Court
                    justice in 1902. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n4317">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4317 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4317"><span>William Dean Howells
                    (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
                    the staff of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Nation</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Magazine</span> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
                    editor-in-chief of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic Monthly</span> from 1871 to
                    1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
                    support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
                    Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
                    Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
                    Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
                    Ashtabula <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel </span>review of the 1860 edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
                    distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
                    hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
                    whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
                    review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Round
                        Table</span>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
                    Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Susan Goodman and Carl Dawson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</span> (Berkeley:
