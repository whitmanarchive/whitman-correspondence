      <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write you just a short letter, if no more, as you are in my mind this
        evening. I sometimes come to the office nights, to read, it is so quiet—and now I am
        sitting here at my desk, with a good lamp, all alone. So I thought of my dear boy, and will
        send a few words, though nothing particular to say. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Johnny, I wish you would write to me when you receive this, whether you have got work yet.
        Dear son, if you feel to come on here on a visit, you come with me—you shall not be
        under any expense for board and lodging. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Johnny, I send you my love, &amp; good night for this time—the mail closes at 8,
        &amp; it is some after 7 now. </p>

                    York, known, according to an unidentified notation on his letter to Walt
                    Whitman, as "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an address book
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #109), Walt Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and October 5,
                    1868, and rode with him on his Second Avenue car; Flood had been a conductor for
                    ten years. After Whitman's return to Washington, there was a brief
                    correspondence, consisting of four known letters from Whitman (<a href="med.00403">November 22, 1868</a>, <a href="loc.01595">December
                        12, 1868</a>, <a href="loc.01596">February 23, 1871</a>, and <a href="loc.01597">March 8, 1871</a>) and one from the young man. Flood,
                    somewhat better educated than some of Walt Whitman's other conductor friends,
                    wrote on <a href="yal.00124">January 11, 1869</a>: "Sir, It is with great
                    pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand to address a few lines to you." He
                    informed Walt Whitman that he had lost his position on New Year's Eve and that
                    he was now seeking another job: "I shall still continue to correspond and can
                    never forget your kind friendship towards me. . . . Your True and Ever intimate
                    friend." According to the first listing of his name in the New York Directory,
                    in 1872–1873, he was at that time either in the milk business or a
                    milkman. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
