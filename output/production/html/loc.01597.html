      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write you just a short letter, if no more, as you are in my mind this
        evening. I sometimes come to the office nights, to read, it is so quiet—and now I am
        sitting here at my desk, with a good lamp, all alone. So I thought of my dear boy, and will
        send a few words, though nothing particular to say. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Johnny, I wish you would write to me when you receive this, whether you have got work yet.
        Dear son, if you feel to come on here on a visit, you come with me—you shall not be
        under any expense for board and lodging. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Johnny, I send you my love, &amp; good night for this time—the mail closes at 8,
        &amp; it is some after 7 now. </p>
