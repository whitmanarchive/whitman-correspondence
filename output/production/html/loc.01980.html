                pecuniary profits to authors &amp; literary men are small and often meagre as to

                progress to a close. by the way I have been asked several times where your books
                could be obtained &amp; as I had sent the paper with Col H's letter to my <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">freind​ </span><span class="tei_corr">friend​

                of the past. Our foe—worthy—calls for help. And shall we who have the
                welfare of our common country at heart refuse to lend that helping hand they now so
