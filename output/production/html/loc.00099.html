                but then mere thousands of sailors; the ships of Venice, Genoa &amp; Spain &amp;
                behold the result! While their ships were crossexamining Mediterranean &amp; Aegean
                sea to find the best harbour wherein to lay hand on Turk they became acquainted with
                navigation, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">with the art of navigation!</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">The spirit of maritime <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">discovery</span> was thus <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">initiated by

                Crusading spirit <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">dies out</span> &amp; trading spirit, venturesome, engendering
                negro-traffic, was ushered <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">into existence</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hence the poet is right to conclude that the Enterprise which originated in Christian Enthusiasm, was 
                killed by the spirit of maritime discovery to which it had given birth</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If the Genoese &amp; Spanish sailors had not been experimenting on the sea in the Crusading expeditions, 
                the best of discovery would not have been developed; Columbus would not have been incited to his expedition 
                &amp; America would not have been discovered.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You see the connection. The discovery of America was the indirect result of the Crusading expeditions. 
                But the spirit of Enterprise crushed that of religious enthusiasm &amp; thus it was that the Turk was 
                allowed to remain to oppress Crete &amp; Greece &amp; now America repays the debt which it owes to the 
                poor Christians of the East whose dream was sealed because America had to be discovered &amp; a maelstrom 
                of material Enterprise to be let loose</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How grandly you might weave all this together in words &amp; mankind—stirring stanzas! Ponder over it

                    of the Joint Select Committee on Retrenchment in early 1867. Bing wrote more
                    than twenty articles on the civil service, which were published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North American Review</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's
                        Magazine</span>. Little is known about Bing, and although this letter suggests
                    that Walt Whitman had written to Bing at least once before, no other
                    correspondence between the two is currently extant. Whitman explored in some unpublished
                    manuscripts the suggestions Bing made about a poem referencing the Crusades but is
                    not known to have published such a work. See also Art

                    fleets at the time. Castile had developed its naval capabilities during
                    the reconquista against the Moors, achieving many victories including the
                    capture of Cadiz in 1232 and the 1402 conquest of the Canary Islands for Henry III 
                    of Castile. Perhaps its most notable achievement
                    was its arrival in the Americas, which resulted
                    from an ongoing race of exploration between Castile and Portugal. </span></span> [<a href="#r0144">back</a>]</li></ul>
