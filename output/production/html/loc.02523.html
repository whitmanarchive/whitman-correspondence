            <p class="tei_p">Your kind pc of Oct. 3rd '91 reached me today
                along with two good letters from Horace full to the brim &amp; running over with—well with 
                himself for surely he is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sui generis</span> &amp; I bless the day that brought me within the circle
                of friendship &amp; community with him.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">My best thoughts to you for your p.c. &amp; for its

                to Fred Wild which I will convey to him at once.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sorry to hear that you are again having "bad times" &amp; I sincerely hope that by this time your 
                bad spell will have again passed
                off or at any rate moderated so as to leave you in comparative comfort</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We dont quite know where J.W.W. is at present but we shall be hearing shortly I daresay.</p><p class="tei_p">

                L. of G. to Humphreys 
                I have not yet heard of its arrival but will let you know, as doubtless H. himself will, when he receives it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have had a terrible storm here &amp; are just getting thro it. The papers tell of great damage done both on land &amp; sea. This 
                morning was one of drenching rain but the afternoon cleared
                up &amp; the good sun smiled again upon the grimy town. Alas that it is so grimy! Truly God made the 
                country and man the town!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We shall all be glad to see J.W.W. again but we hope he will not hurry away from you this time &amp; we are 
            anxious that he shd stay as long as possible for his health's sake. He seems in good spirits &amp; 
            is having a real good time all through</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With kindest regard to all your house &amp; with best love to yourself</p>
