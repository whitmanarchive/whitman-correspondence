                arranged for the money to get tools to make the meter? I think Gurd<a href="#n4284" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4284">6</a> will go east for
                the tools about 2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> April and will be back here with them (I hope) early in
                June—so far all looks well for the meter and if it actually turns out
                according to appearance at present I may be a better off man after this year in which
                case I hope to see more of you and (if that is possible) do more for you. Mrs Bucke<a href="#n4273" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4273">7</a>
                and little Pardee<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">8</a> are still in Sarnia, they are having a good time and it is doing
                them good I guess—All quiet here, plenty of work, but as long as we can do it
                we must not grumble at that—still, if I had my own way I would have a little
                less work and a little more rest</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    sick—has fits of being out of his mind." Bucke would have been
                    particularly interested in Stafford, who had worked as a turnkey at the London

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
