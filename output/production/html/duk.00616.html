                    Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Louisa's date and assigned the year 1873 (Walt

                    refers to the recent death of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, and Mattie died
                    on February 19, 1873 (see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's February 24, 1873 letter to

                        (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As

                        1867 and a nationally recognized name. He married Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
                        Whitman (1836–1873) in 1859, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman shared
                        their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for St. Louis in 1867. For more

                        yet to receive—for not writing. Jeff explained that "there were many
                        things I had to do" (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson

                    Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
                    associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
                    Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
                    Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.

                    of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
                    bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00615_n6 note" id="duk.00615_n6"><span>Louisa Orr Haslam

                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
