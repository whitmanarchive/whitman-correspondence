                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    wrote frequently, Whitman allowed almost two years to elapse between his
                    replies. In the midst of her accounts of the activities of her children,
                    Gilchrist reaffirmed her ardent affection. On <a href="loc.02877">July
                        4–6, 1874</a>, she wrote: "I believe if I could only make you
                    conscious of the love, the enfolding love my heart breathes out toward you, it
                    would do you physical good. Many sided love—Mothers love that cherishes,
                    that delights so in personal service, that sees in sickness &amp; suffering such
                    dear appeals to an answering limitless tenderness—wifes love—ah you
                    draw that from me too, resistlessly—I have no choice—comrades love,
                    so happy in sharing all . . . Child's love too that trusts utterly, confides
                    unquestioningly" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt

                    Company, 1918], 113). On <a href="loc.02878">September 3–14,
                        1874</a>, Gilchrist noted that a year ago (see Whitman's <a href="upa.00015">August 17, 1873</a>, letter) she had received Whitman's
                    ring "that put peace and joy and yet such pain of yearning into my
                    heart—pain for you, my Darling &amp; sorrowing helpless love that waits
                    and must wait useless, afar off, while you suffer" (Harned, 117). On <a href="loc.02879">December 9</a>, she begged: "So please, dear Friend, be
                    indulgent, as indeed I know you will be, of these poor letters of mine with
                    their details of my children &amp; their iterated &amp; reiterated expressions
                    of the love and hope and aspiration you have called into life within
                    me—take them not for what they are, but for all they have to stand for"
