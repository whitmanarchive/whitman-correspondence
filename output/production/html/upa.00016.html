            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of July 8 has reached me, &amp; is comforting, as always. I must write
                you at least a line or two. Don't mind my long silences. My illness has not lifted
                since I last wrote you, &amp; is still upon me—the last two or three months the bad
                spells have been frequent &amp; depressing. Yet I keep up, go out a little most
                every day, &amp; preserve good spirits.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am cheered &amp; pleased by the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">friendly &amp; living
                photographs</span>. You did well to send them to me. I shall keep
                them by me—look at them often—they do me good.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have just sent you a paper. When you write, tell me more about your children—Percy &amp; all. Love to
                them, &amp; to you, dear friend.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Before enveloping my letter, I take a good long, long look at the
                    photographs—with all their silence, cheery &amp; eloquent to me, as I sit here
                    alone by my open window—A vague impressiveness, a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">thought</span>, not without solemnity—which you must understand without my
                    writing it—comes over me, like a little sun–cloud, this vapory day—&amp; with
                    that, &amp; once again my love, I close.
