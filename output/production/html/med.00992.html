            <p class="tei_p">Among the New York editors, your and my old friend M.
                M. Noah,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> the Nestor<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> 
                of the band, leads the list—in point of age and experience, at
                any rate. What a successful editor he has been! Good-hearted, always willing to do
                a kindness, liberal handed, not too nice in his political morality, true to his
                friends, and not very spiteful toward his foes, desirous to live well, and almost
                equally desirous that others also should live well—such are some of the
                characteristics of Major Noah. He has seen New York grow up, as it were; at any rate
                he has seen the growth of what we possess in the way of literature and classic
                refinement. For some forty years he has trod the stage—and life, that has proved a
                tragedy to so many, has been to him an even drama. Long may it be ere the curtain
                drops upon his last act!</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Major Noah still retains his portliness of form, activity
                of limb, and benevolence of feature. He mixes much with the world, and is acceptable
                every where. You may see him of an evening, for a stray hour, on a back bench in the
                first tier of the Olympic—or perhaps the Broadway. He has excellent taste as a
                critic of the drama, and has written some by no means bad pieces himself. When he
                condescends to talk in the gossiping vein, of past times, then you get a treat
                indeed. We know few persons who are more entertaining in conversation than Major
                Noah. He is always lively, with French vivacity and grace in his style—and always
                brings up something interesting. He is now a proprietor and editor of the "Sunday
                Times,"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> and it is said, likes a little dab in the editorial columns of some other
                prints, too. Few men have more personal friends, and few men have done as much good,
                according to their means.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">Col. James Watson Webb,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> may perhaps, without impropriety,
                stand next upon our list. His journal undoubtedly exercises a good deal of
                influence—at least it does, if those appalling large advertising sheets ever
                exercise any influence. The style of Col. Webb's writing is forcible, almost
                dictatorial, with many dashes of self opinion, scorn, and impatience of opposing
                argument. Col. W. is considered as the head, among editors, of "the other side" of
                the whigs, than Horace Greeley.<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">5</a>  He lives in style, and always among the "upper ten."
                He used to have town houses and country houses; but alas! such things seem not
                intended for editors; and so they have failed him. Col. Webb, in person, is full and
                healthy looking; he limps a little, from the effects of a wound in a well-known
                rencontre.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Since the death of Col. Stone,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> 
                Mr. John Inman<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a> has been principal editor
                of the Commercial Advertiser. By most persons it is considered a still better paper
                under his management than formerly. Col. Stone was remarkably conservative; he
                inherited the notions of the old federalists, or rather shared them, and was, in
                politics, somewhat of a thorn in the whig side, for he never deigned to "soft soap"
                the people. Mr. Inman is more genial in ideas and sentiments. He possesses
                considerable literary talent, and was for some time the principal editor of the
                "Columbian Magazine." His writings, however, are not deep; their principal merits
                are a flowing style, and an opportune choice of subject. Mr. Inman labors under an
                infirm state of health consequent upon too continued application.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Beach,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">8</a> you
                know, has retired from the "Sun," and left it to his boys. That was a lucky "spec"
                of his, in getting hold of the little ricketty, dingy concern that few expected to
                live six months! Perhaps the records of newspaper experience furnish no instance of
                a more rapidly growing and widely flourishing newspaper. Mr. Beach had his good and
                his indifferent qualities. I cannot say I think he possessed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bad</span> ones, decidedly.
                One of these days I intend to give you a description of the "Sun" establishment.</p>

                    [March 1967], 99–102). Mordecai Manuel Noah (1785–1851) and T. W.
                    Meighan edited the new work, titled, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sunday Times

                    pieces by Whitman that were published in the paper include the article "A Visit
                    to Greenwood Cemetery," (1844) and "Tale of a Shirt: A Very Pathetic Ballad"

                    (1802–1884) served in the army and then resigned to become the proprietor

                    later, in 1829, he purchased the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Enquirer</span> from
                    M. M. Noah (1785–1851) and created the paper known as the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Courier and Enquirer</span>. At that time, James Gordon Bennett,
                    Sr. (1795–1872)—who would later found <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New York
