            <p class="tei_p">I'll write you a few
                words again—for this warm weather
                enough of a "plentiful suffering" to

                Garrison at the <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_unit_word tei_gap_quantity_1">[illegible]</span> Memorial I was
                warmly curious to know what you could 
                have said. My curiosity has not abated by
                one jot and I would esteem it a favor
                if you would let me know at
                least the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">substance</span> of your matter.
                Was it published? If not you ought
                send it to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Index</span>: at this I would
                be overjoyed, for I could then see &amp;

                this delightful weather I think so often of the
                pleasurable walks and chats we could have
                in the Park if you were only here to make
                the second party! Must I ever hope against
                hope? Fiddlesticks and gridirons! what a
                little deceiver hope <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">can</span> be! Yet, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">will</span> you
                come? I yearn along in a devil-care sort
                of a way for that lecture from you, &amp;
                those keen bits of wisdom, and a trifle of
                your sarcasm. But if I even think all
                this, I do not for a twitch forget that you
                owe me nothing—no such pleasure or gratification—and
                that if it ever really comes, I am the
                lucky dog and you the Sir Beneficence. 
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">On the hour-cars the
                other night I fell in with an ex-professor
                of a theological seminary somewhere out
                of Philadelphia. We talked a long while. I 
                quizzed and he discoursed. This lasted well nigh
                an hour, and at last, when his religious questions
                got more personal, I had to let out that I
                was a pagan. He looked askance and a trifle
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jp.00196b.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jp.00196b.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jp.00196b.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jp.00196b.jpg</span>
                stern with brows drawn, but I speedily taxed his
                toleration and he relaxed. Finally he went
                his way and I mine—and the Sagacious 
                Unknowable himself but knows when we'll
                meet again! Still, I found the man very
                tolerant—as befits a reader of Goethe, Schiller
                Lessing and his royal brothers-in-Truth—and
                the conversation may last in memory.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have waded through another novel—Charles
                Reade's "It's never too late to mind."
                Excepting a chapter here and there, I do
                not fancy it much. My bias is for Dickens.
                I like a good <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">aim</span> of pathos in a novel—nothing
                maudlin but all natural. I think Dickens
                supplies this about as good as the next. William
                Black is good, usually, in the respect, though apt
                to overdo. It always seems to me that
                only a hard-headed man can read, for a 
                case, in "David Copperfield," Pegotty's account
                of his search on the Continent
                for Little Emily—without tearful eyes.
                To think of it alone often makes me sad—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_nhg.00643.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_nhg.00643.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_nhg.00643.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_nhg.00643.jpg</span>makes me anxious in a way that does me good. I think I could almost like the poet Gray, live in an atmosphere of novels forever—devour them, figuratively speaking. 'Tisn't the solidest food at all times, and I ought not thus exaggerate; but I have a sincere passion for the best among them, and can't honestly deny it.

            <p class="tei_p">When you write I would like to have you tell me about that Goethe-Schiller matter. I think I referred to it in one of my last letters.</p>
