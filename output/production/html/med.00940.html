              <p class="tei_p">I feel like writing at once about something that has delighted me. In talking with Thomas 
              Sergeant Perry<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> last night we fell to discussing your work, and to my delight I found him a 
              great and unequivocal admirer of your work. I was pleased beyond measure, for Mr. Perry's 
              opinion on your work is more valuable to me than that of any man in America—with one 
              exception. Mr. Perry is a man of vast learning. He is a historian of literature. He knows 
              the development of all Western literature, he is just finishing a large volume—very 
              radical—on the Greek literature, he has written on German and English literature. 
              His criticisms are based not on personal feelings but upon principles—he looks at 
              any man from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">comparative standpoint</span>. He is the leader of that school of thought 
              with us here. So you see this has value—this opinion of his. He has been abroad 
              for some years studying and now is writing on various historical lines. Mr. Howells<a href="#n4317" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4317">2</a> 
              and he were two of my most honored friends.</p>

                    (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
                    for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American West. For his
                    relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "Garland, Hamlin," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
                    Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998). On <a href="loc.02129">April 19, 1888</a>, Garland, who was a friend of
                    Kennedy's, wrote to the poet for the first time. He was giving a series of
                    lectures entitled "Literature of Democracy" in which he was "trying to analyze
                    certain tendencies of American life somewhat in accordance with the principles
                    you have taught." Garland did not share Kennedy's gloom about Whitman's
                    reception: "I am often astonished at finding so many friends and sympathizers in
                    your work and Cause. In my teaching and lecturing I find no difficulty in
                    getting Converts to the new doctrine and find your poems mainly irresistible in
                    effect. True they do not always agree that they <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">are</span>
                    'poems' though acknowledge their power and beauty. I do not care what they call
                    them (I say to them) and receive their allegiance just the same." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00940_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00940_n2"><span>Thomas Sergeant Perry
                    (1845–1928) was an academic and a literary translator and historian. He
                    was educated at Harvard and later became a member of the faculty. During his
                    academic career he tutored in German and served as an English instructor at
                    Harvard, and he taught English literature in Japan. Perry served as the editor
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North American Review</span> for a short time, and he was a
                    lifelong friend of the novelist Henry James (1843–1916). Perry married
                    Lilla Cabot (1848–1933), an American Impressionist artist who counted
                    among her mentors the founder of Impressionist painting, French plainter Claude
                    Monet. After several years of living abroad, the Perrys returned to the United
                    States and resided in Boston; they were the parents of three children. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4317">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4317 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4317"><span>William Dean Howells
                    (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
                    the staff of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Nation</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Magazine</span> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
                    editor-in-chief of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic Monthly</span> from 1871 to
                    1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
                    support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
                    Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
                    Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
                    Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
                    Ashtabula <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel </span>review of the 1860 edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
                    distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
                    hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
                    whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
                    review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Round
                        Table</span>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
                    Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Susan Goodman and Carl Dawson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</span> (Berkeley:
