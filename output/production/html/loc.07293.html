            <p class="tei_p">I have had the Inspector here since thursday evening—he went East (to Toronto)
                this morning. All quiet again and nobody hurt—This morning I got the little
                bundle of papers (Aug. 87)<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> from you, many thanks. We
                have had another fall of snow yesterday and last night, quite a lot came down,
                several inches. It is now (under the influence of quite a warm sun) departing as
                rapidly as it came, by tomorrow evening (if the weather keeps as now) it will be all
                gone. I am still reading Brockden Brown<a href="#n6184" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6184">2</a> and he interests
                me a good deal, more than I had expected. No letters from any of our friends and no
                news. I trust you are easier—I wish I could in any way make you more
                comfortable, perhaps by &amp; by I shall be able</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
