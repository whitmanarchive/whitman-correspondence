            <p class="tei_p">I have had the Inspector here since thursday evening—he went East (to Toronto)
                this morning. All quiet again and nobody hurt—This morning I got the little
                bundle of papers (Aug. 87) from you, many thanks. We
                have had another fall of snow yesterday and last night, quite a lot came down,
                several inches. It is now (under the influence of quite a warm sun) departing as
                rapidly as it came, by tomorrow evening (if the weather keeps as now) it will be all
                gone. I am still reading Brockden Brown and he interests
                me a good deal, more than I had expected. No letters from any of our friends and no
                news. I trust you are easier—I wish I could in any way make you more
                comfortable, perhaps by &amp; by I shall be able</p>
