            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I was in hopes we should have seen you here before this time—our grounds are beautifull now, the trees are just in full leaf and they have that delicate fresh
                look which is so charming—the place is full of birds singing from early
                daylight all day long. A great many of your friends here are looking out anxiously
                for you (I have told them I expected you). I hope your health is not worse—I
                must say I am more afraid of that old complaint (something like laziness) keeping
                you away from us, than I am of your bodily health. But if you are still unwell
                remember that is all the more reason you should come here. I wish you would drop me
                a postcard. I am getting anxious about you</p>
