            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">My thorn first writes me a scrawl saying she had a pleasant call on you. 
             After receiving yr somewhat melancholy card saying that "they all came" in 
            on you, preachers &amp; all, I felt rather sorry I asked her to go. But I'm 
            glad she did. She visits always in Philad. at house of her friend 
            Mrs. Leslie Miller. 'Lel' the Husband runs a city school of design up 
                there near Girard College, or nearer the synagogue on Broad St. Well he used to be a
            progressive man when young &amp; in Boston, wore slouch hats, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">long hair </span>&amp; read Whitman. But he has grown 
            contemptibly conforming, conventional, since going to Philad, married, &amp; 2 child<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">n</span></span>.  
            He drew those pictures of yr home for my book; but takes the blackguard view of you. My dame laid him out 
            flat after calling on you. She can do such things, is keen as steel. She writes me he will never mention 
            you again to her.  He told me once (he is realy good fellow at heart) that he actually saw you in a livery stable, 
            several times!!!  I wanted to ask him if that was not the place for an artistling to be occasionally, too, &amp; 
            and if Rosa Bonheur &amp; 
                Meissonier wd n't be apt 
             to be seen a great deal in stables.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When a poor librarian 'tother day thrust that gigantic snob R.G. White's 
                pitiful parody of L of G. in my face &amp; 
                thot he had floord me, he said he ahd heard that Edwin Arnold had been calling on you &amp; tried again to like 
                L. of G. &amp;— <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">could</span>n't—aw!</p>
             
                <p class="tei_p">please excuse clipping of Transcripts. I have to do it for my writings now.</p>
