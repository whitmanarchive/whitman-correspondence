                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    (1822–1899) was a French Realist painter and sculptor. Her work often
                    features farm and barnyard animals, and Bonheur was well-known for wearing men's
                    clothing, which she attributed to her research in stables. In 1865, Bonheur
                    became the first woman to receive the Grand-croix of the French Légion
                    d'honneur. Bonheur was openly involved in two romantic relationships with women.
                    She and her first partner, Nathalie Micas (1824–1889), lived together for
                    over forty years until Micas's death. Bonheur was then romantically involved
                    with American painter Anna Elizabeth Klumpke (1856–1942). Bonheur, Micas,
                    and Klumpke are buried side-by-side in Paris's Père Lachaise Cemetery. For

                    five-painting cycle depicting the career of Napoleon, only two of which were
