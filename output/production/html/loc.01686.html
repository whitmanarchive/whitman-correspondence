        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Charles Stoddard,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a></span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I received some days since your affectionate letter, &amp; presently came your beautiful
        &amp; soothing South Sea Idyll which I read at once.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Now, as I write, I sit by a large open window, looking south &amp; west down the Potomac
        &amp; across to the Virginia heights. It is a bright, warm spring-like afternoon. I have
        just re-read the sweet story all over, &amp; find it indeed soothing &amp; nourishing after
        its kind, like the atmosphere. As to you, I do not of course object to your emotional &amp;
        adhesive nature, &amp; the outlet thereof, but warmly approve them—but do you know
        (perhaps you do,) how the hard, pungent, gritty, worldly experiences &amp; qualities in
        American practical life, also serve? how they prevent extravagant sentimentalism? &amp; how
        they are not without their own great value &amp; even joy?<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">It arises in my mind, as I write, to say something of that kind to you—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am not a little comforted when I learn that the young men dwell in thought upon me &amp;
        my utterances—as you do—&amp; I frankly send you my love—&amp; I hope we
        shall one day meet—</p>
