                    editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">For Idé og Virkelighed</span>, is credited with
                    introducing Walt Whitman to Scandinavia by quoting translated passages from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in an 1872 essay in his magazine. He
                    wrote to Walt Whitman on October 19, 1871:
                    "I intend to write
                    an article about yourself and your writings in the above named periodical which
                    is very much read in all the Scandinavian countries. ... I therefore take the
                    liberty to ask you, if you should not be willing to afford some new
                    communications of yourself and your poetry to this purpose" (The Library of
                    Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r0793">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_rlc.00015_n2 note" id="rlc.00015_n2"><span>On <a href="loc.01916">July 24,
                        1876</a>, Schmidt reported his recent marriage to "my dear faithful little
                    wife, to whom I have been betrothed since some years." The letter written "six
                    weeks before" may be Schmidt's letter of <a href="loc.01915">April 18,
                        1876</a>, in which he admitted his failure to sell Walt Whitman's books in
                    Denmark. Walt Whitman's reply, probably written late in May or early in June
                    1876, is not known. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
