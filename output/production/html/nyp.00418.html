We are not to be universalists in painting &amp; sculpture are we (I guess not) &amp; revive the idiotic sculptures of India, Aegypt &amp; Palenque, or the old wood paintings of the Pre-Giottesque painters? Things grow obsolete—worn out. Yet Stedman welcomes heartily, he says, the idea of a new &amp; grander style in poetry. But I'm sure

                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
