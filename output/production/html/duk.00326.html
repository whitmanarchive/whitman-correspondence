I saw Joe a short time before he was hit and after he was wounded he was carried through the lines of our Regt. It was very discouraging to us as we lay on the hill to see hundreds of men leave their regiments without being hurt at all and some 2 or 300 wounded were either carried or walked through our ranks going to the rear. I think we was completely out generald<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>  the most of our men was good enough but I think that they was badly handled. Mother I have just received a letter from you dated August 16th which is the only word I have had from home since we left Fredericksburg. We shall probably encamp here for a few days to recruit up a little and I hope you will write to me as soon as you get this. Mother do not feel the least uneaisiness about me as I never was heartier or ruggeder in my life. I am getting tired so good bye to all  I will write again soon<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>

                    significant in placing the letter soon after the Second Battle of Bull Run, for
                    historians agree that this Union defeat was owing to the tactical errors of
                    General John Pope, and not to any lack of troop morale. Additionally, George's
                    mention of having received a letter from his mother dated August 16,
                    1862—the first from home since his regiment moved up from
                    Fredericksburg—seems, at the very least, to place this fragment in the
                    early part of September 1862.It is interesting to note that Walt Whitman shared
                    his brother's disappointment in the Union military leaders. Concerning the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">first</span> battle of Bull Run, he wrote this description of
                    the Union officers who had returned to Washinton after the battle: "The
                    principal hotel, Willard's, is full of shoulder-straps—thick, crush'd,
                    creeping with shoulder-straps. (I see them, and must have a word with them.
                    There you are, shoulder-straps!—but where are your companies? where are
                    your men? Incompetents! never tell me of chances of battle, of getting stray'd,
                    and the like. I think this is your work, this retreat, after all. Sneak, blow,
                    put on airs there in Willard's sumptuous parlors and bar-rooms, or
                    anywhere—no explanation shall save you. Bull Run is your work; had you
                    been half or one-tenth worthy of your men, this would never have happen'd.)"

                    probably written soon after George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman from <a href="duk.00324">August 17, 1862</a>; it appears to
                    dwell on the same subject: the results of a battle that included the Fourteenth
                    New York State Militia (Eighty-Fourth Regiment of Infantry). In fact, it may
                    well be the last part of the letter of <a href="duk.00325">September 5,
                        1862</a>—which lacks a closing signature. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
