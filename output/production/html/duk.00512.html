                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
                    George, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n16">16. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00512_n16 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00512_n16"><span>Walt Whitman's February 9?,
                    1868 letter (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, ed. Edwin
                    Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:360),
                    though it is more likely to date February 10 or 11, 1868, is not extant. Based
                    on this response from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Walt in his letter informed
                    Louisa that he was again working on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.
                    Presumably, he had begun the revisions that led to the fifth American edition
                    (1871–72). For more on that edition, see Lee Mancuso, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_25.html">Leaves of Grass, 1871–72 Edition</a>."According to Mancuso, Walt
                    Whitman began revising for the fifth edition "as early as summer 1869," but this
                    letter indicates that he was writing or revising <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> actively in February 1868. If Whitman's revision for the
                    1871–72 edition began in early 1868, the correspondence concerning William
                    Michael Rossetti's expurgated London edition may have played a significant role
                    in prompting Whitman to return to his poems (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/index.html">Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael
                            Rossetti</a></span> [London: Hotten, 1868]). </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li></ul>
