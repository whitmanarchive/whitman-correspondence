            <p class="tei_p">i have just got your letter
                i thought it was a goner but it has
                come all safe with the 2 doller i got the
                letter of last thursday Walter and the one
                i neglected to speak of of some time
                ago of a friday so i have not missed
                any the last weeks one i liked its
                giving a description of how you
                spent your time) and i got the
                franklyn almanack
                but i have 
                not got the papers you spoke off
                to day but probably shall get them
                to morrow
                the carrier seems very
                Obliging i gave him the 50 cts for new year
                and last week i gave him 25 cts as he had
                brought me a number of books and the
                almanac its a real good one much
                better than the tribune one
                so i think i will
                make out for almanacks this year
                mary hasent come yet the weather has
                been very bad indeed so i think she could

                the tops in water so she took it off and dried
                her feet and had to go back she said
                mrs wells would be uneasy about her if she
                dident go back) i felt uneasy very after
                she went and i see how very bad it was
