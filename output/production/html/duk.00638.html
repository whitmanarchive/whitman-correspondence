                    30, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke's date for this letter is somewhat ambiguous.
                    After assigning the date February or March 1869, he then added a phrase "Not[?]
                    March," though his word "Not" is unclear. All dates that Edwin Haviland Miller
                    assigned in February or March 1869 are associated with other letters (Walt
                    Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:367), so Miller may not have assigned a date
                    for this letter. Bucke's month March can be confirmed on the basis of numerous
                    contextual consistencies. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her own hand the
                    day of the week Tuesday and the calendar date "30," and she wrote that some
                    activities are "prepa[tory?] to moving." She moved from 1149 Atlantic Avenue to
                    71 Portland Avenue at the end of April 1869 (see her <a href="duk.00580">April 25–27?, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman). The letter is
                    consistent also with Walt's recent receipt of his brother Thomas Jefferson
                    Whitman's March 25, 1869 letter on his family's housing situation in St. Louis
                    (presumably reported to Louisa by Walt in a letter not extant) and with the mass
                    dismissal of female clerks in the Treasury Department at the end of March
                    1869. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n13 note" id="duk.00425_n13"><span>Edward Whitman

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    Velsor Whitman wrote that George Washington Whitman (1829–1901), Walt's
                    brother, "expects he will have to go to the foundry." George was going to the R.
                    D. Wood Foundry in Camden, New Jersey, to inspect the "new main" for Moses Lane,
                    chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works. George was the sixth child of Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    He enlisted in the Union Army 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of
                    the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December
                    1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864).
                    After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on
                    speculation, with a partner known only as Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For
                    more information on George, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00638_n5 note" id="duk.00638_n5"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
                    his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
                    continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
                    death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
                    Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
                    you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
                    1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see

                    right margin of the page. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman refers to the widespread
                    layoffs in the Treasury Department. The Printing Bureau planned to terminate
                    seventy female and fifteen male employees at the end of the March. In the
                    Government Printing Office, seventy-five "females" were discharged from the
                    folding room. An unstated number of "females" were discharged from the bindery.
                    The dismissals were to come "from the least efficient and most obnoxious,
                    politically, of the employe[e]s" (see "Washington: The Contest Between the
                    Senate and the House on the Tenure-of-Office Bill—Great Reduction of the
                    Clerical Force in the Departments—Discharge of Female Clerks," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, March 28, 1869, 1). The discharge of
                    Treasury Department employees was followed by Louisa in part because Walt
                    Whitman's close friend William D. O'Connor served there. A week later Walt
                    reported that his "situation in the office continues the same" and that "William
                    is still in the Treasury Dep't" (see Walt's <a href="pml.00028">April 7,
                        1869</a> letter to Abby H. Price). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
