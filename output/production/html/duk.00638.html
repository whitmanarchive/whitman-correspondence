            away if he could leave) i am pretty 
            well only last sunday morning i
           hurt my knee i catched my foot
            and struck my knee and it got
            so lame in the coarse of the day
            i could hardly walk it is a little
            better at present but is very stiff
            i thought i was glad george was
            gone for i couldent hardly doo
            any thing when i was entirely still
            it dident hurt me much but i tryed

            to walk and it hurt me so i had
            to sit still but i think it will be
            better soon i have been trying to get
            things straighened
                up a little prepa<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">tory</span>
            to moving when my knee was so lame
            i thought what would i doo if
                i was so i couldent walk but 
            i can walk quite smart to day
            if i keep my knee strait it hurts
            me so to bend it) i suppose we shall
            have to go as soon as the house is
            in any kind of condition
            if george
            comes home i shall get him to have
            one of the stoves put up to get the
            wall perfectly dry i dont regret
            leaving this house when the cellar
            is open i can smell the dampness
            up stairs if the door is open they
            have every kind of stuff down there
            and the rats has dug so the water
            comes in every rain i told mrs
                steers they ought to open the doors
            every clear day but she is very
            much engaged making money
            to think of any thing she is clever to
            me but they want the rooms i suppose
                its natural enoughf i have the
            music marm and the daughter to 
            practice and all) i have had no
                corresspondence at all only your s
            dear Walt so i havent heard from
            any body only as you say you have
            had a letter from jeff
            i should think
            as matty is so smart they would
            keep house)
            you remember Walt i always
            said if Grant
            got to be presedent i hoped
            he wouldent disappoint his party
                but i dont know i hope he wont but i
            suppose time will tell)</p>
