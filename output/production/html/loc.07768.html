            <p class="tei_p">Rather warm weather—moist and sweaty, suits me—I am sitting up in the big
                chair this afternoon—looking languidly at the proof &amp; copy for the
                printers—they &amp; the boss are kind &amp; indulgent to me—so far I
                like them &amp; the work—had a bowel motion this morning (took a calomel
                powder last night)—I eat my meals every time, one at a time (rather
                moderately) so far yesterday—have eaten stew'd chicken—oatmeal
                gruel—strawberries—&amp;c. I had two moderate roast apples for my supper
                Mrs. Harned sent me—Oesler was here
                every day—is faithful—was here two hours ago—Baker is here &amp; devoted—is very cautious (I wanted to take
                a calomel powder last night, but he was not willing to do it till he had your or
                Oesler's authority first)—Hadn't I better take these powders ab't twice a
                month, following them with the bitter water—in the chronic condition I seem to
                be in they seem to bring better result than any thing else—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Pete Doyle was over this evening—I was real glad to see
                him—he only staid two minutes—Horace Traubel has
                been—the printers move on quite lively—I have had a pretty good hour
                feeling on the 9 hour turning to night—If I can get over the great debility
                &amp; the bad feeling (jellity &amp; soreness &amp; half pain) in my head, spells
                frequent, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">then</span> I shall feel I am getting on ahead—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is certain I hold the main in mend &amp; eat moderately &amp; have another bowel
                movement to day—but I keep very weak—head is uncomfortable—To day
                is hot &amp; stuffy, but I don't mind—</p>
