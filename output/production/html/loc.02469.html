Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                    Exposition was initiated by an Act of Congress in 1890, when Chicago was chosen
                    as the site for the event celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of
                    Christopher Columbus's "discovery" of America. Planners requested a
                    commemorative poem from Alfred Lord Tennyson, who declined; the request angered
                    many in the U.S., who felt that Whitman should be asked instead. Despite a
                    number of attempts to get Whitman to write a poem for the event, Whitman
                    declined, and he died seven months before the exposition finally opened (a year
                    late) in May of 1893. It is possible that the poem Whitman was working on during
                    the last months of his life–published posthumously as "A Thought of
                    Columbus"–was an effort to write a commemorative poem. See Andrew Vogel,
