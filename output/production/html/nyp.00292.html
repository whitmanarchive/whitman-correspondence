            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">My hand has been pretty bad, but looks more encouraging to-day. I don't think there
                is anything very serious, but it has caused me much suffering, since I have been
                here. If the "Radical" has come, send me a copy immediately.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> Address to No 101 Portland avenue,
                opposite Arsenal. Mother is well as usual. We both send love to you and Nellie. I
                expect to be back next Monday.</p>

                        3–22. In an undated letter, probably written early in June 1870,
                        Louisa Van Velsor Whitman commented: "that Lady seems to understand your
                        writing better than ever any one did before as if she could see right
                        through you. she must be a highly educated woman" (The Trent Collection of
                        Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
                        Library). On <a href="duk.00392">June 13, 1870</a>, Charles Heyde
                        wrote of the article: "Yet you percieve, even the praise she bestows [i?]s qualified with the general
                        recoil, which all natures of true human sensibility experience, at your
                        (mistaken) barbarism. The louse and the maggot know as much about
                        procreation as you do, and when you unveil and denude yourself, you descend
                        to the level of the dog, with the bitch, merely."</p>

                        Scribner &amp; Welford, 1887], 187), he probably arranged for its
                        publication in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical</span>, which was printed in
                        Boston by Samuel H. Morse, and which included among its contributors at
                        least two of Walt Whitman's friends, Conway and Alcott; see Frank Luther

                        Joseph B. Marvin, was now a clerk in the Treasury Department and was
                        acquainted with Walt Whitman; Marvin is mentioned in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00293">December 11, 1874</a> letter to John
