            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">My hand has been pretty bad, but looks more encouraging to-day. I don't think there
                is anything very serious, but it has caused me much suffering, since I have been
                here. If the "Radical" has come, send me a copy immediately. Address to No 101 Portland avenue,
                opposite Arsenal. Mother is well as usual. We both send love to you and Nellie. I
                expect to be back next Monday.</p>
