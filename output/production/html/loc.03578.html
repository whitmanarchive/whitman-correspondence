            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I expect you are plagued with a good many letters, so I want to explain why all the
                same I mean to write this &amp; ask you to do something for us.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Shd. I care in yr. place to be plagued by "sympathizers" wanting things? Probably
                not. But yet it cheers one to think one's words are welcome &amp; have borne fruit
                in distant lands. So anyway I thought you wd. like to know that we here (my boys
                &amp; we masters) had been reading yr. "Gospel of Comradeship,"—yes in our
                School Chapel too, not caring for brother Grundy &amp; old wifes talk of
                "Inspiration" &amp; "Canons <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03578.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03578.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03578.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03578.002_large.jpg</span> of Scripture; but reading that Gospel with many more. This we
                thought would cheer you up, &amp; hoped, knowing how "Leaves of Grass" had cheered
                up us English, men &amp; boys.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Now our fellows here have taken the Gospel to heart &amp; have wished "The Love of
                Comrades" for their

                And one boy has tried to give it an English &amp; school dress, to suit our case.
                I enclose the result.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now I don't believe you will be offended at his presumption. Yr. song is for
                Americans, &amp; this one here like most good Englishmen today feel America more
                than a cousin, yet we want<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03578.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03578.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03578.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03578.003_large.jpg</span> a song more suited to our purpose.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now it wd. be a swell thing to have a song straight from yr. fingers, or a 
                least a line from you
                about this. So I write, this feeling it an intrusion when you have so many to think
                of, to ask if you will not write us a few lines.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are using the music written by a friend of mine for that comrade song in Edward

                been &amp; is too much a function of neat trousers a mere tiny affair.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We want them to have something rousing for their song—not merely
                English but world-wide. England is having queer times, but the juice is still
                here. Give us a Battle Cry; we will get music &amp; lungs &amp; hearts. And whether

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
