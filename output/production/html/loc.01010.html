                    private in Company I of the 120th New York Infantry, was wounded at the Battle
                    of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. Whitman noted that Vandemark was placed in
                    &#x93;bed 39&#x97;Ward B&#x94; at Armory Square Hospital, and Whitman may have
                    written a letter to Vandemark's sister Sarah in Accord, New York (Edward F.

                    home on furlough and was briefly transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps during
                    the summer of 1864 before returning to his regiment. He was killed on a skirmish
                    line during the charge on Fort Davis at Petersburg, Virginia, on September 28,
                    1864. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
