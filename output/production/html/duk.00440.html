                    assigned the date September 5, 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's

                    afternoon,"Louisa Van Velsor Whitman describes the trip that she completed
                    "yesterday," from her home in Brooklyn, New York, to Burlington, Vermont, to
                    visit her daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde. In his letter of <a href="loc.00441">September 11, 1865</a>, Thomas Jefferson Whitman
                    reported that "Mother left last Monday," so this letter dates to September 5,

                    Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
                    Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles was infamous among the
                    Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. According
                    to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's <a href="loc.00440">July 16, 1865</a>
                    letter, the reason for Louisa's visit to Hannah in September 1865 was that she
                    and her husband had quarreled about "some women that Heyde had in his room."
                    Louisa had told Jeff that she intended to "bring Han home," a suggestion that
                    Jeff ridiculed. Jeff insisted that Louisa's visit to Hannah be delayed until
                    George Washington Whitman could accompany her, but Jeff eventually reconciled
                    himself to Louisa's visit to Hannah in Burlington (see his <a href="loc.00441">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00440_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00440_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. George
                    was available to accompany Louisa on her trip because he had just begun his
                    post-war housebuilding business. According to Louisa's <a href="duk.00438">August 8, 1865</a> letter, after being mustered out of the army George
                    considered journey work (day labor) and starting his own business. Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman recommended the latter but may have encouraged his own
                    supervisor Moses Lane to offer George a position with the Brooklyn Water Works
                    (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00441">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt).
                    George in July began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith
                    and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
                    inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. During the war, he was wounded in the
                    First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the
                    Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). For more information on George, see

                    the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
                    grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. Eddy remained in Brooklyn during Louisa's visit to
                    Burlington under the care of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Jeff's wife, with
                    whom Louisa and Eddy lived in the Portland Avenue home. George and his wife
