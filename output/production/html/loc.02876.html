            <p class="tei_p">Two papers have come to hand since I last wrote; one containing the memoranda made during

            <p class="tei_p">Days, they are busy with humble enough occupations, but lit up for me not only with the light

                laid such strong hold upon it that she fears nothing, questions nothing,—no life, or 
                death, nor, in the end, in her own imperfections flaws, shortcomings. For to be

                so conscious of these, and to love and understand you so, are proofs the germs of all are 
                in her, &amp; perhaps in the warmth &amp; joyous sunshine of your presence would grow fast. 
                Any how, distance has not baffled her and time will not. A great deal of needlework to be 
                done at this time of year; for my girls have not time for any at present; it is not a good 
                contrast or the right thing after longish hours of study—much better household activity 
                of any sort. If they would but understand this in schools &amp; colleges for girls &amp; 
                young women! No healthier or more cheerful occupation as a relief from study, could be found 
                than household work—sweeping, scrubbing, washing, ironing, cooking—in the variety 
                of it, &amp; equable development of the muscles, I should think equal to the most elaborate 
                gymnastics.

                I know very well how I have felt, &amp; still feel the want of having been put to these 
                things when a girl. Then the importance afterwards of doing them easily &amp; well &amp; 
                without undue fatigue, to all who aim to give practical shape to their ardent belief in 
                equality &amp; fair play for all! In domestic life under one roof, at all events it is 
                already feasible to make the disposals without ignominious distinctions,—not all the 
                rough bodily work never ending, still begining; and the mental culture and abundant leisure 
                all to the other—but a wholesome interchange and sharing of these. Not least too among 
                the advantages of taking an active share in these

                duties is the zest, the keen relish it gives to the hours not too easily secured for reading 
                &amp; music. Besides, I often think that just as the Poem Nature is made up half of rude 
                rough realities &amp; homely materials &amp; processes, so it is necessary for women to construct 
                their Poem, Home, on a groundwork of homeliest details &amp; occupations providing for the 
                bodily wants &amp; comforts of their household, and that without putting their own hands to 
                this, her Poem will lack the vital fresh growing nature-like quality that alone endures, 
                and that of this soil will grow, with fitting

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
