                    Whitman wrote to Abby H. Price, who was dead when he wrote to Helen on April 21,
                    1881. Whitman, who had lived with the Prices at various times in the 1860s,
                    evidently did not visit them after his mother's death in 1873 until he journeyed
                    to his birthplace in 1881. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00043_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00043_n3"><span>This is one of Whitman's
                    characteristically misleading statements. He had exhausted the first printing of
                    100 to 150 copies of the 1876 edition, but he sent, as his Commonplace Book
                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) and his letters reveal, many copies of
