                    (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mountain County Herald</span> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
                    as correspondent of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York World</span> from 1860 to 1862.
                    In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
                    until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
                    next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
                    and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poets of America</span>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,

                    Why Whitman used the initial C, not E, is unknown. On March 2, when Traubel and
                    Bucke visited him, O'Connor said: "I have had many talks with Stedman and have,
                    I am confident, broken down most of his remaining prejudices against Walt"
                    (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.41.html">Saturday, March 2, 1889</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n0129">5. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0129 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0129"><span>The naturalist John Burroughs
                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
