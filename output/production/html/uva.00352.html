                &amp; then in the afternoon read it through a second time—every little item is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">interesting</span>—poor Mat, she has indeed had a narrow escape<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a>—to think how it might have happened by another hair's breadth—We are having beautiful weather here—quite cool, 
                except in the middle of the day—I am feeling well as usual—nothing special or new in the office—all seems to go on smoothly—Mr. Evarts<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> is here—Ashton<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> has gone to New York for a few days—I have just sent off quite a batch of letters to Hannah—</p></div>
