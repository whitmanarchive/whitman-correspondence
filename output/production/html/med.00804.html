                    (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
                    introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
                    the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
                    carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman, the Man</span> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
