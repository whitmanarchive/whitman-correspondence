                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Whitman:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Thank you very much for the "Two Rivulets," which came sparkling, and dancing, and
                babbling into my house this morning. I have long been acquainted with your writings,
                and have taken a great interest in them. I wish you had given me a line to say what
                you were doing, and how you were. I trust the world uses you fairly well, but I do
                not think it is a world that is much to boast about. Mr. Tennyson has been in London
                for the last six weeks, and now he has gone to his home in the Isle of Wight. I have
                often heard him speak of you, and about you, in a way that would be gratifying to
                you, as "Walt Whitman, the Poet," and "Walt Whitman, the man," and I like your
                portrait. It reminds me a little of that of Isaac Walton.</p>

                <span class="tei_salute">I am, very sincerely yours,</span>
