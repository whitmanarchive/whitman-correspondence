            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Thank you very much for the "Two Rivulets," which came sparkling, and dancing, and
                babbling into my house this morning.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> I have long been acquainted with your writings,
                and have taken a great interest in them. I wish you had given me a line to say what
                you were doing, and how you were. I trust the world uses you fairly well, but I do
                not think it is a world that is much to boast about. Mr. Tennyson<a href="#n0625" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0625">2</a> has been in London
                for the last six weeks, and now he has gone to his home in the Isle of Wight. I have
                often heard him speak of you, and about you, in a way that would be gratifying to
                you, as "Walt Whitman, the Poet," and "Walt Whitman, the man," and I like your
                portrait. It reminds me a little of that of Isaac Walton.<a href="#n2007" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2007">3</a></p>

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r0625">back</a>]</li><li id="n2007">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n2007 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n2007"><span>Izaak Walton was a
