                    Ballads" bro't by Herbert Gilchrist—I specially enjoy such things—I am ab't as usual (perhaps a little under a
                cloud, passing, I hope)—we hear from dear Mrs. C[ostelloe] and the birth of the child
                    (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rachel</span>—good name)—Mr S[mith] will be over there, almost with this—he is a very dear
