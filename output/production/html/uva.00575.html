            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">The last time I called on you we had a delightful conversation about books. And
                I would like to repeat this visit, but I know your time is taken up with callers of
                all kinds—and beside conversation while it may be retained in the memory years
                afterward is not like a written letter from an author that we can keep and
                cherish. I have your autograph in both your works but I want you to write me
                your views on the books a young man should be most familiar with, tell me the
                authors that have most delighted and instructed you. I have a few books and in
                them I have a few autograph letters that I preserve by putting carefully in the
                front, that gives them to my eyes an increased value. Now there are some authors
                that I cannot get a scrap of, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">they are dead</span> I know you
                receive and have received correspondence from Emerson, Carlyle
                &amp; Tennyson—havent you a bit you would spare me from some
                of these men if it is only a line—as Mark Twain
                says—was writ <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ss tei_unclear_cert_low">wis</span> his
                own hand. I don't mean those letters you cherish and mean to till you
                die, but I would value them doubly as coming from you—</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours Respectfully—</span>
