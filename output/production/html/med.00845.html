                paper-bound specimen satisfactory—But I think you can do it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">better</span> for

                judgment)—if you have anything better as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">strong</span> backs (stitching &amp;c) as can
                consistently be made—uncut &amp; untrimm'd like this sample (I like this sample even as
