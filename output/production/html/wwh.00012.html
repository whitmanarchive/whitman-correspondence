            <p class="tei_p">I will just write you a line to let you know I am all right—I sent you a <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​  paper the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> of to-day with an <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acc't</span>​  of the funeral—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling pretty well for me—am stopping with Mr Johnston and his wife &amp; family—there is a big family &amp; they have moved up here in 5th Avenue—very grand—a big four or five story house, near 86th St overlooking the Park, cool &amp; fresh as can be—all are very kind, especially Mrs J. (the new one)—the children all call me Uncle Walt—the baby is bright &amp; interesting, but not rugged—(I hardly think its tenure of life secure)—I have many invitations, but don't accept them—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen John Burroughs &amp; he wants me to go up there to Esopus, but I don't think I shall go—I find my gray clothes very seasonable here, as it is cool enough all the time except at mid-day—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Hattie and Jessie are there, all right—Dear girls, I send you my best love, &amp; I will soon be home &amp; see you—I will finish to-night—</p>
