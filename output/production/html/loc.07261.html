            <p class="tei_p">Another month commenced and am greatly in hopes we are to have some fine weather to
                make up for the nearly 40 days rain we have had. At all events the month has opened
                well. A lovely bright, hazy, warm, fresh autumn morning. I got yesterday the bundle
                of papers including "Critic" and was much interested in the review of Crawford's
                    "Kalevala." Also in the "Tribune" article on what New York is doing in the way of provision for
                her insane—this is a live issue with us here at present and I forwarded the
                article with a letter to Hon<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">ble</span> A.S. Hardy (Provincial
                Secretary) recommending that we do something of<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00445.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00445.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00445.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the same sort. In the
                afternoon came <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">McKay's</span> "November
                    Boughs"—for which many thanks, I like it well
                and if I had not seen the other should have thought <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">it</span>
                quite perfect, as it is I like <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> "N.B." with the limp
                cover best. Horace tells me that Musgrove is to leave on Sunday or Monday morning. I have written
                Ed. Wilkins and will have him leave here by 11.40 train Sunday
                morning. He will reach Philadelphia about 8 a.m. Monday. I shall give him full
                directions to your house and letters to you and to Mrs Davis.
                Still no word from W<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">m</span> Gurd—looks as if he has had an attack of agraphia—inability to
                write—confound the fellow he promised to let me know every few days how he was
                getting on and has only written one letter in 2½ weeks. All well here had a big
                crowd of young folk at the house last evening (All-Hallow-E'en) telling fortunes,
                dancing &amp;c &amp;c great fun</p>
