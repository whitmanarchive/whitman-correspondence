                I am still very much occupied.
                Two doctors still sick and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one</span> sent me in place of them leaving me 
                1 doctor short—then
                there is one of the sick doctors upstairs to be looked after. I am 
                in the middle of my lectures to students, have just
                come from the lecture room where I spoke two hours on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Mania</span>—I have 4 more lectures to give
                and hope to be through by Xmas. If by that time I should have a full staff again I will try and get a little rest—possibly
                I may run down to Atlantic City for a couple of weeks and so could kill two birds with one stone, get a good rest and see you

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
                    see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

Bucke is referring
                    to the so-called "Baconian theory." Francis Bacon (1561–1626) was an
                    English philosopher, scientist, statesman, and author. Bacon's personal
                    notebooks and works came under scrutiny during the nineteenth-century because of
                    suspicions that he had written plays under the pen-name William Shakespeare in
                    order to protect his political office from material some might find
                    objectionable. For more on the Baconian theory, see Henry William Smith, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Was Lord Bacon The Author of Shakespeare's Plays?: A Letter to
                        Lord Ellesmere</span> (London: William Skeffington, 1856). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
