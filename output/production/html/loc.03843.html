            <p class="tei_p">Thank you—thank you! for several kind remembrences of you in periodicals and
                for your letter &amp; postal, all of which bridge over
                the great separating waters of the Atlantic. Our Alys
                will have before this seen you, I trust, and given us a picture of how you fare in
                these days. Having got through the murderous heats of the Camden summer, I greatly

                will have a cheerful winter. I would that I could look in on you now &amp; then in

                &amp; near—the hearty tribute of reverence and affection from those whose
                lives you have helped to illuminate &amp; cheer, yet I know that there must be mixed

                &amp; next our own, knows not one half the reasons why we smile or sigh"—and down in the depths of unrevealable consciousness, the problems are
                fought out—alas! with what small results of certitude. Not a few of us have
                met great audiences with bold words while the depths of purgatory were being stirred

            <p class="tei_p">In our country home at Haslemere—close, by the way, to Tennysons home—are many highly cultivated people who love you. Alys
                will tell you how like paradise our home there is—and how often we have wished
                that we might have you there to drive around the beautiful hills, two thirds in
                woods &amp; undergrowth for miles. I had hoped to guide you across the ocean, 
                but I fear that we may not now hope for that.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Logan is bravely &amp; industriously doing his work at
                Oxford. He shows clear signs of talent but is not in haste to use his pen for the
                public. Alys has the courage to go alone across the sea to finish her college course
                &amp; get B. A. added to her name. Mary is under a nervous
