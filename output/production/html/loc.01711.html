          <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Rudolf Schmidt:</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your note of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="January​ ">Jan.</span>​  5, acknowledging receipt of "papers," &amp; enclosing to me your
          photograph, is just received. I like your
        photograph &amp; thank you for it—&amp; I like indeed the good frank way of
        sending such pictures, where interested &amp; curious. I wish to know whether you
        have safely received the particular copy of the last edition of my poems, in One
        Vol., with some sheet photos. enclosed, which I sent you by Mr. Clausen. Mr. C. tells me that he put up the various matter I
        furnished in three parcels—if you have got the three it is all right.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I mailed you a letter of some length, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="January​ ">Jan.</span>​  16. I shall send you, probably by next
        mail, my latest piece, in a western magazine for February. Also a second
        copy of my pamphlet "Democratic Vistas"—If the first copy reached you, send
        the second to Mr. Bjornson—if not, not. Yes, I am sure
        I should like your friend Bjornson much.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am going next week to New York to stay there till April 10—my address there
        will be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">107 north Portland av. Brooklyn, New York, U. S.
          America</span>—about April 10, I shall return here again, &amp; my address
        will be—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this at my desk—as above, Treasury Building, middle of
        afternoon—From my great south window I can see a far-stretching &amp; noble
        view, many, many miles of open ground, the Potomac river, the hilly banks, the
        mountains of Virginia &amp;c. We are having a severe cold spell. Every thing is
        white with snow, but the sun has been clear &amp; dazzling all day—The hour of
        office-closing is nigh. And I too must close. I have much pleasure in writing to
        you, &amp; expecting yours.
      </p>
