                    Horace Tarr and Horace G. Tarr) (ca. 1844–1922), a native of Missouri, was
                    the nephew of the Brooklyn engineer Moses Lane (1823–1882). Tarr served in
                    the Civil War, enlisting with Company K 20th Regiment of the Connecticut
                    Infantry Volunteers in 1862, when he was still a teenager. After Gettysburg,
                    Tarr was promoted to first Lieutenant, and, during the Atlanta campaign, he
                    became the Captain of Company F. After the Civil War, Tarr worked as an engineer
                    and a business manager for two iron companies. He later married, and he and his
                    wife were the parents of six children. Tarr was mentioned in the correspondence
                    between Whitman and his brother, Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890) and
                    seems to have been a longtime friend of Jeff Whitman. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_uva.00616_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="uva.00616_n2"><span>See Tarr's letter to Whitman

                    William E. Worthen (1819–1897), an engineer and old friend, Tarr thought
                    that "a thousand of dollars or so could be cheerfully raised, or given" to
