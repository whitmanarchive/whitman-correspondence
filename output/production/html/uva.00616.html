                Y'rs just rec'd—I send photo of Jeff—If properly 
                handled ("processed" is the common way, for preparing for printing
                on the power press) it can be made a capital picture, 
                can be enlarged to any size. Is a good likeness 
                &amp; was taken eight or ten years ago—Yes I will 
                write a few lines to go with it—I shall want 
                some copies sent here by mail <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">without fail</span>. 
                My copies of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eng[ineering] Record</span> with 
                article have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> come—slips also not come—I hope 
                they will not be neglected—&amp; will ask you 
                if convenient to jog the editor's 
                memory—Horace, ab't the kind mention 
                &amp; offer ab't my dear niece
                (God bless you,
                Horace dear boy—and God bless the dear engineers)—I do not at 
                this moment know what to say definitely (for Jessie)—and 
                will write you further—also ab't the 
                sculptor—am unwell to–day—
