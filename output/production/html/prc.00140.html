            <p class="tei_p">Good comfort for me to get the letter rec'd from you today—(A
             fellow likes so to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">made much of</span>). Probably the word
                "finished" abt the L. of G. I sent is Horace's, not mine. As I go over the book two points
             satisfy me as well as any—those are the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">atmosphere</span> &amp; the notion
             of all, whatever it is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">being in process</span> (evolution) from first page to last.
            Of course I know its numberless deficiencies—but I hope I have provided for them.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Sit here alone in big chair this cool weather with big wolf-skin spread
                back ag't draughts—bad days &amp; nights, every hour its 
               suffering—inveterate gastric inertia &amp; bladder troubles all eventually started from and
               germinating from the Washington paralysis through and at end of war.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Am not in want of anything—y'r noble help (toward $900) from the 
                Phila. lecture has directly benefitted me &amp; does to–day, in ways w'd please
                you well if you c'd know.</p>
