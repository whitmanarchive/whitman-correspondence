                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    he also wanted to be able to present copies to his friends. A version of the
                    1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, often referred to as the
                    "deathbed edition," was bound in December of 1891 so that Whitman could give the
                    volume to friends at Christmas. The following year, the 1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Phildelphia publisher
                    David McKay. This volume reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex consisted of a long prefatory essay
                    entitled "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" and sixty-five poems; while the
                    second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection of thirty-one short poems taken
                    from the gathering of prose and poetry published under that title by McKay in
                    1891. For more information on this volume of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>, see

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    continue to worsen during the month of December 1891. On December 17, Whitman
                    came down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his right lung.
                    Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would never
                    recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel Longaker of
                    Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care during his
                    final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4c">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_prc.00140_n4 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="prc.00140_n4"><span>Whitman is referring to the
