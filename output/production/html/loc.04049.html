            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have had all the welcome papers with accounts of your doings,<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">1</a> and to-day a nice long letter from Mrs. Whitman,<a href="#n0368b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0368b">2</a> which I much enjoyed, giving me better account of your health again, &amp; of your great enjoyment of the water travel through Canada. So I hope, spite of drawbacks, you will return to Camden for the winter quite set up in body, as well as full of delightful memories. If only we were at 22nd St. to welcome you back &amp; talk it all over at tea! Ah, those evenings! My friends told me I looked ten years younger when I came back from America than when I went. And I am not yet quite re-acclimatized; &amp; what with missing the sunshine &amp; working a little too hard, was feeling quite knocked up: so Bee<a href="#n0260" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0260">3</a> insisted on my coming down, or rather up, here to stay with some very kind &amp; dear friends. The house stands all alone on a great heath-covered hill, and below &amp; around are endless coppices, so that you step from the lawn into [a] winding wood-path, along which I wander by the hour: and from my window I look over much such a view as we had at Round Hill Hotel, Northampton, this time two years, only that with the soft haze that is so often spread over our landscape, the distant hill looks more ghostly in the moonlight. My friend is a noble, large-hearted, capable woman, who devotes all her life and energies to keeping alive an invalid husband; and he well deserves her care, for he has a beautiful nature, too, &amp; their mutual affection is unbounded. He is just ordered by the doctors to leave the home they have made for themselves up here—which is as lovely as it can be—&amp; to spend two years at least in Italy. So it is a sorrowful time with them—they have no children, but have adopted a little niece. Our new house is just ready &amp; we are daily expecting our furniture from America. Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">4</a> has been working as usual, making good progress &amp; has just done a beautiful little drawing for the new edition of his father's book. Bee, you will be glad to hear, has decided to continue her medical studies &amp; is going to be assistant to a lady doctor at Edinburgh, who is to pay her sufficient salary to cover all remaining expenses. Meanwhile we have got her at home for a few weeks to help us through with the move in, and a sad pinch it will be to part with her again. Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">5</a> has been paying a delightful visit to some friends of Carpenter's<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">6</a> near Leeds—a Quaker family—the daughter very lovable &amp; admirable. We do not forget the Staffords<a href="#n1009" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1009">7</a> nor they us. Mont. often sends Herby a magazine or a token. Love to them when you see them, &amp; to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Whitman &amp; Hattie<a href="#n0911" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0911">8</a> &amp; Jessie<a href="#n1055" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1055">9</a> &amp; kindest remembrance to Dr. Bucke.<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">10</a> Send me a line soon, dear Friend—I think of you continually &amp; know that somewhere &amp; somehow we are to meet again, &amp; that there is a tie of love between us that time &amp; change &amp; death itself cannot touch.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    family of Harry Lamb Stafford (1858–1918), a young man who Whitman
                    befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's parents, George (1827–1892) and
                    Susan Stafford (1833–1910), were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
                    Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. In the
                    1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby Glendale. For more on

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
