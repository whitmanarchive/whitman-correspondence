                <span class="tei_salute">My Dearest Friend:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have had all the welcome papers with accounts of your doings, and to-day a nice long letter from Mrs. Whitman, which I much enjoyed, giving me better account of your health again, &amp; of your great enjoyment of the water travel through Canada. So I hope, spite of drawbacks, you will return to Camden for the winter quite set up in body, as well as full of delightful memories. If only we were at 22nd St. to welcome you back &amp; talk it all over at tea! Ah, those evenings! My friends told me I looked ten years younger when I came back from America than when I went. And I am not yet quite re-acclimatized; &amp; what with missing the sunshine &amp; working a little too hard, was feeling quite knocked up: so Bee insisted on my coming down, or rather up, here to stay with some very kind &amp; dear friends. The house stands all alone on a great heath-covered hill, and below &amp; around are endless coppices, so that you step from the lawn into [a] winding wood-path, along which I wander by the hour: and from my window I look over much such a view as we had at Round Hill Hotel, Northampton, this time two years, only that with the soft haze that is so often spread over our landscape, the distant hill looks more ghostly in the moonlight. My friend is a noble, large-hearted, capable woman, who devotes all her life and energies to keeping alive an invalid husband; and he well deserves her care, for he has a beautiful nature, too, &amp; their mutual affection is unbounded. He is just ordered by the doctors to leave the home they have made for themselves up here—which is as lovely as it can be—&amp; to spend two years at least in Italy. So it is a sorrowful time with them—they have no children, but have adopted a little niece. Our new house is just ready &amp; we are daily expecting our furniture from America. Herby has been working as usual, making good progress &amp; has just done a beautiful little drawing for the new edition of his father's book. Bee, you will be glad to hear, has decided to continue her medical studies &amp; is going to be assistant to a lady doctor at Edinburgh, who is to pay her sufficient salary to cover all remaining expenses. Meanwhile we have got her at home for a few weeks to help us through with the move in, and a sad pinch it will be to part with her again. Giddy has been paying a delightful visit to some friends of Carpenter's near Leeds—a Quaker family—the daughter very lovable &amp; admirable. We do not forget the Staffords nor they us. Mont. often sends Herby a magazine or a token. Love to them when you see them, &amp; to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Whitman &amp; Hattie &amp; Jessie &amp; kindest remembrance to Dr. Bucke. Send me a line soon, dear Friend—I think of you continually &amp; know that somewhere &amp; somehow we are to meet again, &amp; that there is a tie of love between us that time &amp; change &amp; death itself cannot touch.</p>
