                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    clarified by recalling Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's political sympathies. Her
                    loyalties were in part to Walt Whitman's employ in Washington under Republican
                    presidential administrations, but she performed a complex act of mimicry. She
                    dramatized for Walt in monologue form Edward "Eddy" Whitman's exchange (and his
                    report of the exchange) with the unnamed Democrat. Eddy reported that the
                    Democrat said, "the radicals were all down," a statement which apparently
                    excited Eddy. Louisa repeated Eddy's report of the Democrat's words, and then
                    she interrupted Eddy to seek clarification because she found Eddy's exasperation
                    to be humorous. So "i how doo you know he is clear he said" could be rendered
                    with formal punctuation and explanatory insertions as follows: "I [said], 'how
                    do you know?' Eddy is clear [the democrat] said, 'it was in the eagle. . . .' It
                    [Eddy's reaction] was quite amusing. . . ." Louisa derided often the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>'s boosterism for the Democratic
                    party. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">13. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00425_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
