            <p class="tei_p">i
                received your letter and
                money and the chigacago news
                all safe and
                sound on tuesday
                i suppose you see in the papers of the
                suspension of roberts the postmaster his being short
                in his returns
                i believe is the cause of his suspension
                it seems hard to get honest people in the post offices
                the very place of all others that ought to be honest
                men but i have been very luckey lately have
                not lost any letter or money since the 5) sometimes
                i think they must have wrote to me from st lo<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">us</span>
                
                and the letter has been taken but i dont know
                that they have written to me i have sent two
                letters to matty since i have got any from her
                mr Lane
                received one from Jeff last week i believ
                it was saying he was just about leaving for
                kentucky but i suppose he is home long before
                this) i must write to han again so as to stir
                up mr Heyde
                see if i get any more of his
                inteligent letters i should think it was almost
                time he blowed off again) well walt you
                washingtonians aint settled the president
                question
                yet i wish it was settled one

                came up stairs yesterday
                towards evening before the eagle
                came the eagle
                came down stairs and the man i think is a
                democ<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">rat</span> 
                he said to Edd the radicals were all down
                or something to that affect so eddy came up
                like mad saying they had cleared the bugge<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">rs</span>
                and he would never have any thing more
                to doo withe them i how doo

                be better to have no congress at all than to doo
                as they had it was quite amusing to see eddy is
                such a gale but when i got the paper i
                see how things were) well walt its storming

                gets the most wages their time goes on george
                hasent been very well it is kind of bad work
                not reall work but it has been so wet and he     
                has to get down in the pit to see to the cementing
                and he gets all mud sometimes and he dont
                favor himself much) well walter dear my

            <p class="tei_p">i have since i wrote this letter got one from
                Jeff and one from Matty Jeff sent me a letter
                on the 28th on his return home with 10 dollars
                which i have never received
                
                and the letter
                man says i never will get it now he had
                a letter with him and read it to me that jeff
                had sent to the post office he said it made
                him feel very bad as it was on his rout
                but if the letter ever came to the brooklyn
                post office it was taken before it came
                to him i think it is too bad i dont think
                but what the carrier is perfectly honest he
                has carried letters for 10 years) he said to day
                their is lots of theiving somewhere

                he said if my son to st louis had sent
                a money order he would have got it
                for me with my signing my name
                i am very sorry i dident tell jeff
                to not send it in a letter he said he
                should send me some money when he
                returned i cant get it without any
                from the post office i wish they could have
                took it from somebody that dident want
                a new dress it was to get mamma a new
                gown never mind it might have been
                worse but its very provoking</p>
