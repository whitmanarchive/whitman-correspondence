            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Since I last wrote to you my illness has been gradually alleviated, until now I go about pretty much the same as usual—I keep pretty old-fashioned hours, rise early, dine at 1, &amp; go to bed before 10—My head feels clear &amp; comfortable, &amp; my strength has returned almost, but not quite up to what it was. I rec'd Nelly's letter, I could not get over to New York that afternoon—Nelly, my dear friend, you must excuse me—I wished much to see you, too<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—I hope you are having a good time &amp; feeling well physically &amp; in good spirits—&amp; the little one, little Jenny, this line is for you, my dear. I hope you too are well—William, I rec'd the volume of Navy Reports, transactions of iron clads, fights, &amp;c. for '62 &amp; '3<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—it will probably give me material for some pieces, thumb-nail sketches, for my "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum Taps</span>"—I take it you had that in view in sending it to me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am trying to make arrangements to publish my volume—I shall probably try to bring [it] out myself, stereotype it, &amp; print an edition of 500—I could sell that number by my own exertions in Brooklyn &amp; New York in three weeks.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd Charles Eldridge's last letter—so he is to go down to front again —how I wish I was in Washington to go with him &amp; Major—I should try it as I am, &amp; be glad of the chance—O I almost forgot the big raid—it is already a thing of the past, I find by my own thoughts &amp; memory, but I suppose it would not do to write a letter to Washington so soon &amp; not mention it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have heard from my brother George up to the 18th inst.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—he was living &amp; well up to that time—At home here all well as usual—Mother's age I think begins to just show—in a few weeks, she will commence her 70th year—still she does most of her light housework—My sister &amp; her children are well—(Nelly, I write these particulars for you)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, William, about the war I have to inform you that I remain hopeful &amp; confident yet<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—I still think Grant will go into Richmond—My brother describes the spirit of the troops as confident &amp; sanguine under all their trials—I wish you to enclose this in your next letter to Nelly—I wish you to give my remembrance &amp; love to the Howells,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> to Miss Howard<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> &amp; to Arnold Johnson<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>—Write soon &amp; tell me all the news—tell me how is Ashton—Good bye &amp; God bless you, my dear friend—</p>
