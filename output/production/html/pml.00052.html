                    Washington, D.C.). Herbert referred to the book on October (?) 20, and Anne

                    David McKay, successor to Rees Welsh &amp; Co. as Whitman's publisher, are now
                    in the University of Pennsylvania Library, exact figures on sales are available
                    until the poet's death. As of December 1, 1882, 4,900 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> had been printed, of which 3,118 were
                    sold. Whitman's royalty was $1,091.30. Only 1,000 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> were printed and 925 copies sold; the
                    return to Whitman was $203.50—a total of $1,294.80. Because
                    Whitman owed McKay money, the actual return was $1,230.78 (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
