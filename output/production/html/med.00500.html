                I tried several magazines, but they were already made up
                for their May numbers. It is the habit of literary folk to leave London during
                Easter, and in order that they might do so this year the editors had their magazines
                for May fixed early in April. But in any case I could hardly hope to get an article
                in here unless I had it three months beforehand—for it takes so much time to
                get it from one editor to another before it gets to the man who wants it. I shall be
                very glad to serve you always, and regret that I have failed in this case.</p>

                    and asked Conway to help place the piece in an English magazine (See Whitman's <a href="loc.01570">March 18,

                    the essay. But "Personalism" was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> magazine in May of 1868;
                    the essay was a sequel to Whitman's essay "Democracy" which had been published in that magazine in December 1867. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n0522">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0522 note" id="n0522"><span>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                        Walt Whitman</a></span> that John Camden Hotten published in 1868. About half of
                    the poems from the 1867 American edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> were removed for the British edition. In his twenty-seven
                    page "Prefatory Notice," Rossetti justified his editorial decisions, which
                    included editing potentially objectionable content and removing entire poems:
                    "My choice has proceeded upon two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every
                    poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings
                    of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include
                    every remaining poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest."
