                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    copy of the final <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> before his death, and
                    he also wanted to be able to present copies to his friends. A version of the
                    1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, often referred to as the
                    "deathbed edition," was bound in December of 1891 so that Whitman could give the
                    volume to friends at Christmas. The following year, the 1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Phildelphia publisher
                    David McKay. This volume reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex consisted of a long prefatory essay
                    entitled "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" and sixty-five poems; while the
                    second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection of thirty-one short poems taken
                    from the gathering of prose and poetry published under that title by McKay in
                    1891. For more information on this volume of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>, see

                    came down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his right lung.
                    Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would never
                    recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel Longaker of
                    Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care during his
                    final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4c">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08039_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08039_n2"><span>Daniel Longaker

                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
