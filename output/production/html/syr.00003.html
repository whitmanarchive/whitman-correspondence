                <span class="tei_salute">My <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear</span> Walt.</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">You do not know me—have never heard of me even—yet you have done more for
                me than all others.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Born and bred in the midst of Puritanical orthodoxy I was early <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">entombed</span> in the church and never had a breath of the pure, free air of
                heaven till I was thirty-five years old. Swedenborg first
                opened the sepulchre and let in the heavenly light so that I saw myself a living
                soul, but it remained for you to breathe upon the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">dry bones</span>
                and make <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">them</span> live. To you alone I owe the discovery that
                "Divine am I inside and out"—that the "body is not
                less sacred than the
                soul."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hours of depression come even upon you. This I know. Therefore, perhaps, it may cheer
                you in some such hour to know how you have lifted up and made happy a brother. This
                is my apology for this intrusion.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I would I could grasp your hand, look in your eyes and have you look in mine. Then
                you should see how much you have done for me.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Yours with a brother's love</span>
