                opened the sepulchre and let in the heavenly light so that I saw myself a living

                and make <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">them</span> live. To you alone I owe the discovery that

                you in some such hour to know how you have lifted up and made happy a brother. This
                is my apology for this intrusion.</p>

                    theologian and mystic who claimed himself as a divinely inspired Christian
                    reformer, rejecting the concepts of the Trinity and salvation through faith
                    alone. Swedenborg is best known for his 1758 book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Heaven and
                        Hell</span>, in which he describes his vision of the afterlife as divided into
                    three parts: Heaven, Hell, and a middle World of Spirits, where the recently
                    deceased first awaken into the afterlife. Swedenborgians established the New
                    Church in England after Swedenborg's death, a movement that spread to the U.S.
                    in the early nineteenth century. </span></span> [<a href="#r0609">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_syr.00003_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="syr.00003_n1"><span>Hawley is quoting from
