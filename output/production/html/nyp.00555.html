            <p class="tei_p">The box (Oranges) has just come, (the letter came two hours ago) &amp; I hasten to
                acknowledge them, without opening the box, but I thank you heartily &amp; know I
                shall enjoy the fruit. I am here not much different from usual late years, but
                older, more broken &amp; paralyzed—I have a little old cottage of my own in
                which I live, &amp; have a good young woman, a widow, for cook &amp;
                housekeeper—I am fearfully disabled, yet retain good spirits—have just
                been out for a drive—Often think of Helen (dear Helen) and you &amp; all—Is this letter address'd
                right?—I should occasionally send H. a letter or paper, but am doubtful ab't
                the address—</p>
