                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter last week a couple of hours after I sent mine. I have written to
                Hannah. Well, mother, we have had a spell of warm weather here—&amp; last
                night &amp; this morning we are having quite a rain—I can see the difference
                this morning already—the grass &amp; trees are beginning to look
                green—they have made a large flower garden right in front of my window at the
                office.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wm O'Connor is coming on to New York to stop three days—he goes on
                to-night—he may call on Jeff at the City Hall—but may-be not—H.
                J. Raymond wants him to come to New York &amp; write for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> &amp;c—but I don't know as he will go<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I went to a concert last night—Brignoli &amp; Parepa<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—nothing very
                great—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new at the office—I went up to the Supreme Court last Friday,
                &amp; heard the Attorney General Mr. Stanbery make quite a great speech—he is
                a good speaker—you would have liked it.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I was down at the hospital Sunday—there was one poor young man, a Maryland
                    boy<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>, very bad from delirium
                tremens—(such cases are getting quite common)—this young man saw such
                sights &amp; terrible things, he took it into his head that the Almighty was in a
                rage, &amp; punishing him—&amp; he just got on his knees, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">remained so for over 12 hours</span>, praying away for
                mercy—so the wardmaster told me—I sat by him some time—he told
                me, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they</span>" went away while I was with him—he said he
                could hear "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">them</span>," a good ways off—but they wouldn't
                come near him while I was there—he got into quite a little nap while I
                remained—you know if the delirium tremens patients can only get a few hours
                good sleep the worst is over—they are rational on most things—One of
                these men, in the hospital, had an idea there was a great cat gnawing at his arm,
                &amp; eating it—he had this idea for days &amp; days, &amp; of course suffered
                awfully—One of the watchmen of the Treasury, (formerly a Captain in the army,
                in an Ohio reg't,) is there in the hospital, with delirium tremens—So you see
                what troubles there are in the world, of one kind &amp; another—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We are quite busy at the office—have a good many people coming—so it is
                quite lively—We had a clerk here, who was a great nuisance to every body, a
                young sprig of a Virginian—he has cleared out, forced to resign—we are
                all very glad—it makes a great relief—all the rest of us get along like
                brothers—I like them all, &amp; they like me.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">If Mary &amp; the girls come, you must give them my love, &amp; tell Mary I shall
                    send her a small package of books soon—I will send word before.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Tell Hattie she must behave like a lady &amp; try to learn—Uncle Walt is
                    coming home soon, to see her<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a>—</p>
