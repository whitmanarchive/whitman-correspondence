            <p class="tei_p">We all arrived safely at Pittsburgh abt 2 oclk to-day—Mattie and the children stood the journey first-rate—and Mat seems to feel fully as well as in Brooklyn  I find I shall probably have to stay here longer than I anticipated—possibly shall not get away tomorrow but hope to—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had quite a pleasant time in coming on—Mrs Rice<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—(with child and nurse) met us at the Depot—I succeeded in getting a state room in the sleeping car—and was particularly fortunate in doing so—as many were left out or rather had to get along without sleep</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I write this merely to tell you that we got through so far all right—and also to send you this [t?]<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—Mat has worried about my not giving it to you ever since we came away—you must thank her for it not me—for to tell you the truth, dear old Mamma I have so much to think about that I do not remember you as often as I ought to.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mattie sends love to you and all—I ditto—and the young ones likewise, will write again from St Louis as soon as we get there</p>

                    Christmas visit to Brooklyn on December 18, 1867, and by early January 1868 had
                    convinced Mattie to move the entire family west. Mattie's earliest letter to
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from St. Louis (February 1, 1868) implies that the
                    family had been there for over a week (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New York:
                    New York Univ. Press, 1977], pp. 44-46); it therefore seems likely that Jeff
                    wrote this letter en route on the third Friday of January. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00446_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00446_n2"><span>Mr. and Mrs. Rice lived
                    in St. Louis at this time, but they seem to have been old acquaintances of the
