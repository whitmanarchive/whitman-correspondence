            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">We all arrived safely at Pittsburgh abt 2 oclk to-day—Mattie and the children stood the journey first-rate—and Mat seems to feel fully as well as in Brooklyn  I find I shall probably have to stay here longer than I anticipated—possibly shall not get away tomorrow but hope to—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had quite a pleasant time in coming on—Mrs Rice—(with child and nurse) met us at the Depot—I succeeded in getting a state room in the sleeping car—and was particularly fortunate in doing so—as many were left out or rather had to get along without sleep</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I write this merely to tell you that we got through so far all right—and also to send you this [t?]—Mat has worried about my not giving it to you ever since we came away—you must thank her for it not me—for to tell you the truth, dear old Mamma I have so much to think about that I do not remember you as often as I ought to.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mattie sends love to you and all—I ditto—and the young ones likewise, will write again from St Louis as soon as we get there</p>
