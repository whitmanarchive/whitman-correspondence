            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I was very ill after my arrival here—&amp; made worse by the heat—but
                have recovered<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—&amp; to-day, Monday, feel about the same as formerly.
                Mother is well, &amp; sends her love to you all—mother asked a great deal
                about Nelly, and also about Jenny—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My brother George is remarkably well &amp; robust this summer—he was out in all
                the excessive heat of the three latter days of last week, &amp; came home every
                evening to his supper, unflagging, &amp; full of strength &amp; fun—I quite
                envied &amp; admired him—especially as I felt deathly weak—indeed
                despicable—but, as before said, I think I am all right again now—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have not been out yet—havn't heard any news of special interest, literary or
                other—havn't seen Mrs. Price—but shall begin to explore, this
                week—&amp; will report in my next—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, I had an unusually pleasant journey that afternoon &amp; evening in the
                cars—felt quite well—enjoyed my lunch, the cold tea, &amp;c—got
                in at Jersey City a few minutes after 10, not a bit tired—Nothing very new
                from my sisters Mat or Hannah—Eddy is as usual—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Jenny, my darling, I must not forget to put in a line for you too, &amp; send my
                love—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> do you see how Mrs.
                    Stowe &amp; the Atlanticites are getting cuffed &amp; smitten front &amp; rear,
                anent of the Byron resurrectionism? The papers are all having articles about
                it—&amp; all condemn the Atlantic article.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a></p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Harriet Beecher Stowe entered the Byron controversy with a vigorous article
                        in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, 24 (September 1869),
                        295–313. "The True Story of Lady Byron's Life" was based on an
                        interview and some notes that Lady Byron, critically ill at the time, gave
                        to her in 1856. She attacked the biographical studies of Thomas Moore and
                        Countess Guiccioli, and almost deified "the most remarkable woman that
                        England has produced in the century."</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Though O'Connor's reply to Whitman is lost, he expressed his opinion of the
                        article with his usual vigor to William Michael Rossetti on August 28, 1869:
                        "One would fancy Mrs Stowe demented to issue this old foul romance, without
                        one scrap of evidence, and pregnable on every side" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span> [New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1903], 460).
