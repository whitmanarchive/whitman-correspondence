                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I was very ill after my arrival here—&amp; made worse by the heat—but
                have recovered—&amp; to-day, Monday, feel about the same as formerly.
                Mother is well, &amp; sends her love to you all—mother asked a great deal
                about Nelly, and also about Jenny—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My brother George is remarkably well &amp; robust this summer—he was out in all
                the excessive heat of the three latter days of last week, &amp; came home every
                evening to his supper, unflagging, &amp; full of strength &amp; fun—I quite
                envied &amp; admired him—especially as I felt deathly weak—indeed
                despicable—but, as before said, I think I am all right again now—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have not been out yet—havn't heard any news of special interest, literary or
                other—havn't seen Mrs. Price—but shall begin to explore, this
                week—&amp; will report in my next—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, I had an unusually pleasant journey that afternoon &amp; evening in the
                cars—felt quite well—enjoyed my lunch, the cold tea, &amp;c—got
                in at Jersey City a few minutes after 10, not a bit tired—Nothing very new
                from my sisters Mat or Hannah—Eddy is as usual—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Jenny, my darling, I must not forget to put in a line for you too, &amp; send my
                love—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William, do you see how Mrs.
                    Stowe &amp; the Atlanticites are getting cuffed &amp; smitten front &amp; rear,
                anent of the Byron resurrectionism? The papers are all having articles about
                it—&amp; all condemn the Atlantic article.</p>
