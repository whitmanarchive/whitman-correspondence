            <p class="tei_p">i received your letter yesterday
            was glad to hear you was as well
            in regard to your lame thumb as you
            are
            i feel quite smart to day and
            yesterday it is much cooler the hot
            days does seem to take me down
            it has been some pretty hot days here
            but is quite comfortable to day)
            i had a letter from han last week
            she seems pretty well wants me
            to come there very much indeed
            i wrote to her that i dident know
                how to undertake the journeey
            in my condition being at times so very
            lame i dont think i could go any how if
            i wasent lame i have got a dress and
                a few things to send her but i cant go
                there this summer
            i suppose Charley heyde
            wrote he had paid all for his house          
            if he was a decent man they might live
            quite comfortable but that will never be
            </p>
