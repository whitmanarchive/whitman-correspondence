                    consistent with President Ulysses S. Grant's expected appointment of Amos T.

                    Massachusetts, from 1870 to 1871. Davis took a degree in civil engineering at
                    Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn
                    Water Works until 1861. He was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to
                    1865, after which he returned to Brooklyn. He would later serve as the city
                    engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and as chief engineer of the American
                    Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). A lifelong friend of Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman, Davis shared the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman, her son Edward, and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's family before

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    (1821–1880) was born in New Hampshire, attended Dartmouth College, and
                    spent his early adulthood as a teacher before studying law in Georgia. Though he
                    opposed secession, he served in the Confederate army under General Robert
                    Toombs. After the Civil War, he served in Georgia's state constitutional
                    convention and was named U.S. district attorney. President Ulysses S. Grant
                    appointed Ackerman to the office of attorney general after the resignation of
                    Ebenezer R. Hoar on June 23, 1870 (see Mark Grossman and ABC-CLIO Information
                    Service, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Encyclopedia of the United States Cabinet</span> [Santa

                    appointment of the attorney general closely because Walt served as a clerk in
                    that office. The "awfull things said" about Ackerman, aside from his being an
                    ex-rebel, may refer to an article that mocked him as an unknown: "The Senate
