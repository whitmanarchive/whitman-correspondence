               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was glad to hear—from your letter to mother—that you had received my letters—containing the $10. &amp;c.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—Everything is all right with us,—the same as ever. Mary and Louisa<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> are down with us. Came on Friday—will probably stay till Wednesday, down shopping  They are all well. Ancel<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> is down on the coast fishing. George<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> is still on the cars. The rest are all the same.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> We have quite a joke on Mother which I bring forward almost every time she asks me if I have heard from you, which is everytime she sees me  'tis this. during the time that we were so long without hearing from you Mother really got very much worried about you and when I went home to dinner on the day before we got your letter, she asked me as usual if I had heard and when I told her no she said "well I cannot imagine what is the matter with Walt. I feel very much worried indeed. one thing is sure he is either sick or else he is coming home"  You can readily imagine how mother looked when I poked fun at her and repeated it to her. She says that she didnt say it so it sounded like I say it, &amp;c  Dear Mother, she would be mighty glad to see [you] I know, but I love to plague her  she will then take Hattie and say that sis is the only one of us that has got any sense, and if it wasnt for you and George she should not have much to live for &amp;c, &amp;c  I hope you will be able to get me a copy of Capt. Mullens' report<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>  also I hope you will give him a letter to Mr Lane.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I like to know such men  I can learn from them. I spend quite a good deal of time lately with Dr Ruggles.<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> He comes in the office quite often and I call at his house and see him. There are a good many things about him to like, I think and he seems to like me. I still continue to go to the Opera once in a while. To night is said to be the last night of the season but I hardly think that they will leave.<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> it seems to me to be paying to well. The houses are generally full. We have not heard from Han since I wrote you last. Mother thinks that she will get Mary to go on for her pretty soon. I suppose it is best that Han should come home but I fear for Mother. I fear that she will undertake in her usual way to do too much  I was awful mad at Heydes last letter. If I had been in his neighborhood I should certainly have booted him. He is a damn fool. Hattie is in first rate condition  she reminds me more of a young colt or dog than a child. It seems to be perfect pleasure for her just to get out into the open air. She dont seem to care to go any where, only outdoors. Yesterday Mother locked the front basement door while she went to some other part of the house a moment—to keep Hattie in. Hattie went in the front basement and shoved the window and was out and away leaving her Opandmouth in amazement abt how she got out. But altogether she is as affectionate and good as it seems to me for a human being (and I dont suppose there is anything better) to be.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> Mattie sends her love.</p>

                    [Washington, D.C.: A. O. P. Nicholson, 1860]). When Whitman met Mullan, Mullan
                    was about to publish his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Report on the Construction of a
                        Military Road From Fort Walla-Walla to Fort Benton</span> (Washington, D.C.:
                    Government Publications Office, 1863). In a notebook entry for April 1863
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #76), Whitman referred to both of these reports. In a letter to his
                    mother from <a href="loc.00765">March 31, 1863</a>, Walt had praised
                    "Capt. Mullin, U.S. Army (engineer), who has been six years out in the Rocky
                    Mt's, making a gov't road, 650 miles from Ft. Benton to Walla Walla—very,
                    very interesting to know such men intimately, and talk freely with them." A
                    transcontinental railroad had long fascinated Whitman; he later wrote an
                    editorial on the subject in 1858 while he was editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</span> (see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Solitary Singer</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1955], 213). Walt
                    celebrated the completion of the railroad in his poem, "Passage to
