                    private in Company I of the 120th New York Infantry, was wounded at the Battle
                    of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. Whitman noted that Vandemark was placed in
                    "bed 39-Ward B" at Armory Square Hospital, and Whitman may have written a letter
                    to Vandemark's sister Sarah in Accord, New York (Edward F. Grier, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1984], 2:644). Vandemark returned home on furlough
                    and was briefly transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps during the summer of
                    1864 before returning to his regiment. He was killed on a skirmish line during
                    the charge on Fort Davis at Petersburg, Virginia, on September 28, 1864. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
