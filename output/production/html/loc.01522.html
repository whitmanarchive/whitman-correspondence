                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete—dear son,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter of the 8th to-day—all your letters have come
                safe—four altogether. This is the third I have sent you (besides that one by
                Adams' Express, Aug. 23d.)
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete, you say my sickness must be worse than I described in my letters—&amp;
                ask me to write precisely how I am. No, dearest boy, I wrote just as it really was.
                But, Pete, you will now be truly happy to learn that I am feeling all right, &amp;
                have been mainly so for the last four days—&amp; have had no bad spells all
                that time. Yesterday I thought I felt as strong &amp; well as ever in my
                life—in fact real young &amp; jolly. I loafed around New York most all
                day—had a first-rate good time. All along Broadway hundreds of rich flags
                &amp; streamers at half-mast for Gen. Rawlins'
                funeral—From the tall buildings, they waved out in a stiff west wind all
                across Broadway—late in the afternoon I rode up from the Battery to look at
                them, as the sun struck through them—I thought I had never seen any thing so
                curious &amp; beautiful—On all the shipping, ferry boats, public buildings
                &amp;c. flags at half mast too. This is the style here. No black drapery, for
                mourning—only thousands of flags at half mast, on the water as well as
                land—for any big bug's funeral.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">To-day I am all right too. It is now towards 3—Mother &amp; I have just had our
                dinner, (my mammy's own cooking mostly.) I have been out all the forenoon knocking
                around—the water is my favorite recreation—I could spend two or three
                hours every day of my life here, &amp; never get tired—Some of the pilots are
                dear personal friends of mine—some, when we meet, we kiss each other (I am an
                exception to all their customs with others)—some of their boys have grown up
                since I have known them, &amp; they too know me &amp; are very friendly.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete, the fourth week of my vacation is most ended. I shall return the middle of next
                week.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to Johnny Lee—let him read this letter, &amp; then return it to you. Dear
                Jack, I rec'd your affectionate letter of Sept. 5th.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete, I have seen Tom Haslett—he is well—he is working extra on Broadway &amp;
                42d st. RR. He does not think of going home till Christmas. Jimmy Foy has not got work yet.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got "Kenilworth" I sent.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, boy, I shall now take a bath, dress myself &amp; go out, cross the river, put
                this letter in the p. o. &amp; then ramble &amp; ride around the City, awhile, as I
                think we are going to have a fine evening &amp; moonlight &amp;c.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Good bye, dear son—We will soon be together again.</p>
