            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">You say it is a pleasure to you to get my letters—well, boy, it is a real pleasure 
                to me to write to you—I just write off-hand, whatever comes up, and, 
                as I said before, mostly about myself &amp; my own doings. [There have been some] 
                tremendous fires—the one [in] Brooklyn—eight or ten first-class steam 
                engines—Tell Harry on No 11, he would see quite a change in the 
                Fire Dep't. Pete, if you see Pittsburgh either tell him the following, 
                or let him have this letter, &amp; then return it to you. Write how David Stevens 
                is, &amp; write how he is getting along.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have more than I can attend to here. I find myself surrounded by friends, 
                many old ones, some new ones, some young &amp; attractive, &amp; plenty of invitations 
                &amp; amusements. I have received an invitation from a gentleman &amp; wife, friends 
                of mine, at Providence, R. I., and shall go there &amp; spend a few days latter 
                part of October. How about the cold? I hope it is well. Dear Pete, with all my 
                kind friends here &amp; invitations, &amp;c., though I love them all, &amp; gratefully 
                reciprocate their kindness, I finally turn to you, &amp; think of you there.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I guess I have written enough for this time. Dear Pete, I will now bid you 
                good bye for the present. Take care of yourself, &amp; God bless you, my loving comrade. 
                I will write again soon.
            </p>
