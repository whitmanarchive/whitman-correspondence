    <div class="editorial_notes"><hr/><p><em>Correspondent:</em><br/><span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0305 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0305"><span>Richard J. Hinton (1830–1901)
                    was born in London and came to the United States in 1851. He trained as a printer, and,
                    like James Redpath (with whom Whitman corresponded on <a href="loc.00778">August 6, 1863</a>), went to Kansas and joined John
                    Brown's militant group of abolitionists. In fact, but for an accident he would
                    have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was hanged.
                    With Redpath, Hinton was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hand-book to Kansas
                        Territory and the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</span> (1859). Later he wrote
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rebel Invasion of Missouri and Kansas</span> (1865) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Brown and His Men</span> (1894). Apparently Hinton had
                    suggested that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>; see the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Voice</span>, 16 (4 February 1899),
                    2. Hinton served in the Union Army from 1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while
                    lying wounded in a hospital, a scene which he described in the Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span> on August 26, 1871. After the war Hinton wrote
                    for many newspapers. He defended William D. O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Good Gray Poet</span> in the Milwaukee <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel</span> on
                    February 9, 1866. Hinton's article in the Rochester <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening
                        Express</span> on March 7, 1868, was a lengthy account of Whitman's "Fame
                    and Fortunes in England and America," with quotations from O'Connor and
                    the naturalist John Burroughs. Obviously pleased, Whitman sent it to friends, including Rossetti,
                    who acknowledged it on <a href="loc.01879">April 12, 1868</a>. See Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.76.html">Friday, September 28, 1888</a>; William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of a Book for the World</span> (West Yarmouth, MA: Stonecroft

                    birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
                    the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
                    (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
                    dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
                    addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
                    arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
