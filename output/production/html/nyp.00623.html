            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for the letter giving me word abt Wm's present cond'n &amp; hope indeed it will
                improve soon—Two months ago I was in a woful &amp; horrible plight, bladder trouble,
                gastric malady &amp; weak as a rag—&amp; I have comparatively got over all &amp; comparatively
                easier &amp; freer—(tho' bad enough yet)—I expect Dr B[ucke] here next week but not
                certain—Best love &amp; cheer to both.</p>
