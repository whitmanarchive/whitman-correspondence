                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
                    chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
                    St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
                    to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
                    educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
                    Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith

"Nelly" O'Connor (1830–1913) was the
                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

                    Whitman sent a cluster of poems entitled "Old Age's Echoes" to Henry Mills Alden
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's New Monthly Magazine</span> and asked $100

                    October 24, Alden rejected the work: "It is too much of an improvisation for our
                    use. I had it set up, hoping that, seeing it in type, I might come to a more
                    favorable impression of its form. The thought is worthy of a more careful
                    texture in its parts &amp; of a more shapely embodiment as a whole. I am not
                    critisizing. Criticism has no place in the poet's world. I am writing only as a
                    Magazine editor with reference to Magazine requirements." Alden's letter cannot
                    be located. On November 2, 1889, Whitman sent the piece, now called "Old Age
