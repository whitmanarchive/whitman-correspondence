                here last evn'g, (a beautiful holly branch with red berries &amp; green leaves),
                a nice long visit—Mary C not at all well as c'd be expected—(her letter to me enclosed)—She is going off to Spain and France on a
                half-jaunt half-racket (by advice of the doctor)—also rec'd a good letter
                from Ernest Rhys (wh I will send you)—by this time E R is back in

                    I think it must have been my guardian angel that gave thee the "impalpable nudge" to write to me. Thy card has 
                    come to cheer me just at a time when I am feeling unusually low in spirits &amp; discouraged. I have been quite ill all
                    summer—"over-work," "nervous prostration," the rest—&amp; in

                    spite of many weeks of tedious "absolute rest," I am worse &amp; not better, &amp; now I have to go off for I don't know
                    how long to the Pyrennees, leaving my husband &amp; the two little ones in England. I start tomorrow. The one bright
                    spot is that mother is going with me. But thy letter has really cheered me—it reminds me that absence is not the
                    end of everything

                    &amp; it sings, without the definite words, the "Song of the Open Road." My road has seemed so shut up—I am laid 
                    aside in the midst of all the work I care for—fit for nothing—and oh! the horror of feeling one's
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mind</span>, as well as one's physical powers, under an eclipse. I have not been able to read
