                    was the son of John B. Pratt
                (1820–1906), a cooper and laborer in the wood products industry, and Nancy
                Pratt (1826–1912). Alfred Pratt was a farmer and a Union soldier during the Civil War; he served as
                a private in the 8th Regiment, New York Cavalry and was recovering from an
                illness when he met Whitman at Armory Square Hospital in Washington, D. C.
                Whitman communicated with Pratt's parents about their son's condition.

Grant defeated Democratic nominee Horatio 
                    Seymour with a 214–80 electoral advantage (Grant received 400,000 more popular votes); incumbent Andrew Johnson did not receive the Democratic Party's
                    nomination after his impeachment and general unpopularity while in office. The
                    race was marked by a close popular vote, although Grant's success as a Union
                    general during the Civil War is widely acknowledged as significant to his
                    presidential victory. After Pennsylvania went Republican in the elections held
