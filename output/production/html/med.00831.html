            <p class="tei_p">I am illustrating E. C. Stedman's Poets of America, and in it I
                find mention made of a portrait of Walt Whitman; the one which was in his Leaves of
                Grass, first edition, and also, I think, in the two volume Centennial edition. I am
                anxious to get a copy of this portrait, and Mr. Stedman suggests that I may do so
                through you. Will you kindly inform me whether or no a copy is obtainable, and, if
                obtainable, the price?</p>
