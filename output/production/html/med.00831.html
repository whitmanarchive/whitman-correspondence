            <p class="tei_p">I am illustrating E. C. Stedman's<a href="#n1043" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1043">1</a> Poets of America, and in it I
                find mention made of a portrait of Walt Whitman; the one which was in his Leaves of
                Grass, first edition, and also, I think, in the two volume Centennial edition. I am
                anxious to get a copy of this portrait, and Mr. Stedman suggests that I may do so
                through you. Will you kindly inform me whether or no a copy is obtainable, and, if
                obtainable, the price?</p>

                    (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mountain County Herald</span> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served

                    In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
                    until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
                    next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
                    and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poets of America</span>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
