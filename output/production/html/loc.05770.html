                <span class="tei_salute"> Dearest Friend:
                </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> At last I have extracted a little bit of news about you from friend Carpenter, who never comes to see us and is [as] reluctant to write
                letters as—somebody else that I know. That you have a comfortable, elderly
                couple to keep house for you was a good hearing—for "the old shanty" had risen
                before my eyes as somewhat lonely, &amp; perhaps the cooking, &amp;c., not well
                attended to.—There seems a curious kind of ebb and flow about the recognition
                of you in England—just now there are signs of the flow—of a steadily
                gathering great wave, one indication of which is the little pamphlet just published
                in Edinburgh—one of the "Round Table" Series—no doubt a copy has been
                sent you. If not and you would care to see it, I will send you one. On the whole I
                like it (barring one or two stupidities)—at any rate, as compared with what
                has hitherto been written. My poor article has so far been rejected by
                editors—so I have laid it by for a little, to come with a fresh eye &amp; see
                if I can make it in any way more likely to win a hearing—though I often say to
                myself, "If they have not ears to hear you, how is it likely one can unstop their
                ears?" But on the other hand there is always the chance of leading some to read the
                Poems who had not else done so.—Percy &amp; Norah and Archie, now grown a very sturdy active little fellow, are coming to
                spend Xmas with us, which is a great pleasure. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am deep in Froude's last volumes of "Carlyle's Life in London". Folks are grumbling that they have had enough &amp; too
                much of Carlyle &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his</span> grumblings and sarcasms. But he is an inexhaustibly
                interesting figure to me, &amp; will remain so in the long run to the world, I am
                persuaded. It grieves me that he should have been so cruelly unjust to himself as a
                husband—that remorse, those bitter self-reproaches, were undeserved, were
                altogether morbid: he was not only an infinitely better husband than she was wife:
                he was wonderfully affectionate &amp; tender &amp; just—&amp; as to his temper
                &amp; irritable nerves, she knew what she was about when she married him. Herby was
                walking through the British Museum the other day with a friend when a group, a
                ready-made picture, struck him—it was a young student-sculptress, a graceful
                girl high on a pile of boxes modelling in clay a copy of an antique statue, &amp;
                standing below, looking up at her, was a young sculptor in his blouse, criticising
                her work with much animation &amp; gesture; the background of the group, a part of
                the Elgin Marbles. So this is what Herby is painting &amp; I
                think he will make a very jolly little picture out of it. I have been much a
                prisoner to the house with bad colds ever since I returned from Wolverhampton, but
                am beginning to get out again—which puts new life into me. I have never envied
                anything in this world but a man's strong legs &amp; powers of tramping, tramping,
                over hill &amp; dale as long as he pleases—legs would content me and a sound
                breathing apparatus! I am in no hurry for wings. Giddy's voice, too, is just now
                eclipsed by cold. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I hope you have escaped this evil and are able to jaunt to &amp; fro on the ferries as freely as
                ever. And I hope the pleasant Quaker friends are well—and Mr. &amp; Mrs.
                    Whitman and Hattie &amp; Jessie—there is a fellow student of Giddy's
                at the Guild Hall music school who so reminds her of Hattie. </p>

                <span class="tei_salute">Love from us all, dear friend. Most from me.</span>
