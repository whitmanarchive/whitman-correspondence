                    Your card of 24<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span> Dec. came two days ago, not a little
                    to my relief. I was beginning to fear lest you were
                    not so well again. This year ought to treat you well, 
                    &amp; give you the wind &amp; weather &amp; everything that you love,
                    seeing that in it you attain three score &amp; ten. If good
                    wishes of friends were of any direct use, physically, I
                    mean, as well as in other ways, it would be the happiest
                    year of your life. It seems very right &amp; fit that in it
                    you should publish the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Édition Définitive</span> in this vol. of

                    The last few weeks have brought nothing perhaps that
                    is very remarkable on the surface here. I have been
                    jogging along quietly enough, but absorbing always a
                    great deal humanly from the endlessly wonderful life
                    of this great London. One of the most striking episodes
                    I have lately had any share in was the Midnight Meeting
                    of the unemployed of London on Christmas Eve. It
                    was held at the foot of Cleopatra's Needle, round the base
                    of which the various speakers were grouped, faced by the

                    motley throng of men, who cheered hoarsely with
                    hungry throats as the speechifying went on. Through the
                    day it had been wet &amp; foggy in turn, but now the sky
                    was of an American clearness, the half-moon shining
                    bright behind the shaft of Cleopatra's Needle, contrasting
                    strangely with the red torches held to light the orators.
                    All together an impressive scene; &amp; when the Christmas Bells
                    rang out, and one of the speakers called out —"Peace on
                    Earth, Goodwill towards Men! If Jesus were in London
                    to-day, would he be in those churches?"—and the
                    crowd shouted back, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"No! he'd be here!—here with
                    us!"</span>—the effect was dramatic in the extreme.

                <p class="tei_p">
                    When I had been standing in the crowd for some time,
                    I discovered Jo. Pennell,<a href="#n4322" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4322">3</a> the artist, standing near me
                    and we presently went home together. He lives in the next
                    street to Cowley St. from which by the way I may have to
                    move shortly as my sister Edith (whom you know) is coming
                    up to town to study music at the Academy.

                    I am writing this at the Reading Room of British Museum,

                    off to meet my brother Percy (who is an actor) at
                    Euston Station. Don't let me forget to tell you that
                    that [sic] last night I saw Edward Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">4</a>—first time
                    these three years—at a meeting of Fabian Socy., where

                    lines in his face. As he is staying in town we shall probably
                    meet again.

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
