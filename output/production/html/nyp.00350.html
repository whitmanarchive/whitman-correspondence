                    <p class="tei_p">This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South bet 4½ &amp;
                        6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Philadelphia | Jul | 31(?)| 12 M

                    <p class="tei_p">The dating of this postcard as well as the notes and letters to Doyle on
                        August <a href="nyp.00351">7</a>, <a href="loc.01658">14</a>,

                        1874, depends in part on Whitman's habit of writing on Fridays. However, as
                        evidenced in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00353">August 5, 1874</a> letter
                        to Ellen O'Connor and his <a href="nyp.00354">August 18, 1874</a>
                        letter to John and Ursula Burroughs, both of which were conclusively written
                        in 1874, Whitman's "alternations" were especially marked during the summer
                        of this year, and despite his "natural buoyancy" he was frequently depressed
                        by the inability of his once healthy body to triumph over his
                    ailments.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
