            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to hear from you. The letter came promptly last Friday with one from Wm. &amp; I wrote him yesterday, &amp; sent the book review. I think it is an admirable criticism, almost the best of Leaves of Grass that I have ever seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William tells me that in the letter Curtis promises to do all he can, &amp; is very much interested, but most likely he has written you all about it.

I was more pained than I can tell you to learn that she was ill, and with one of those dreadful fevers. The poor little thing! Isn't it s pitiful thing to see a child sick? To me far more appealing than the sickness of a grown person.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The critical time was Sunday last you said, now it is Tuesday, I hope she is better. Try to send me a line to say how she is.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sorry for your sake, dear Walt, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00948.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00948.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00948.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>that your mother is away. I know how you would miss her. But perhaps by this time you have gone for her. I hope you will go, &amp; will have a pleasant journey and visit.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have delayed writing that I might give you the latest news of Mrs. Ashton &amp; baby, but Charley went in there &amp; Ashton had gone home to see them. Speed had returned, I think he was gone for a week. Mr. Pleasants said they were well when Ashton left for Philadelphia.

            <p class="tei_p">Miss Howard's sister Sallie is very sick, I think typhoid fever, &amp; I have been out to-day trying to get a nurse for her. So far Garaphelia has taken care of her night &amp; day, &amp; she looks worn out.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are well, so is Charley. Jeannie sends love. She was very sorry &amp; sympathizing about little California. I trust the little thing is better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My sister Jeannie's little Mary is very sick with typhoid <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00948.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00948.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00948.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>fever too, but they hope not dangerously so.</p>
