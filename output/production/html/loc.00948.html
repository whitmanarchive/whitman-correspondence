         <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to hear from you.<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> The letter came promptly last Friday with one from Wm. &amp; I wrote him yesterday, &amp; sent the book review. I think it is an admirable criticism, almost the best of Leaves of Grass that I have ever seen.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William tells me that in the letter Curtis promises to do all he can, &amp; is very much interested, but most likely he has written you all about it.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>

To me far more appealing than the sickness of a grown person.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The critical time was Sunday last you said, now it is Tuesday, I hope she is better. Try to send me a line to say how she is.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have delayed writing that I might give you the latest news of Mrs. Ashton &amp; baby, but Charley went in there &amp; Ashton had gone home to see them.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Speed had returned, I think he was gone for a week.

                    with William and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William O'Connor
                    (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an
                    abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
                    O'Connor, William O'Connor's wife, had a close personal relationship with
                    Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William Douglas
                    O'Connor over the Fifteenth Ammendement, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor
                    supported. Ellen O'Connor defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William
                    O'Connor established a separate residence. The correspondence between Whitman
                    and Ellen O'Connor is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with
                    William.

                    who in 1865 proposed to William O'Connor that he write to George W. Carleton, a

                    assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Whitman's affairs,
                    and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan fracas. In
                    December 1862, on his way to visit George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman
                    stopped in Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk
                    in the office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George
                    had not been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his
                    home until 1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major
                    Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00948_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00948_n4"><span>Matthew F. Pleasants, who

                    Howard as "a good, tender girl—true as steel." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
