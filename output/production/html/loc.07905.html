            <p class="tei_p">Pleasant sunny day out &amp; I am getting on fairly considering—the long
                fearful obstinate <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bowel-block</span> seems to be edged upon, even
                started, (or suspicion of it)— have pretty good nights—must have five or
                six hours sleep—no vehement pain night or day that I make acc't
                of—bladder trouble not pronounced at present—use the catheter most every
                day—eat my two meals daily or something of them, farina, roast apple, rare
                fried egg, mutton &amp; rice, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Dr Longaker, (652 north 8th st: Philadelphia) comes every 2d day,
                &amp; I like him &amp; his doings—there has been some little correspondence
                bet'n him &amp; Dr Bucke—the latter is well—I got
                letter to-day. Wish you to pass this scrawl to J W W[allace],
                as he may like to know particulars—the Nat[ional] Review comes to-day &amp; I
                have been looking at W Sharp's piece—(all guessing
                ab't future American National Literature seems to me guessing on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the weather</span> of years f'm now)—the proofs of "Good-Bye My Fancy" are
                slowly getting along—have sent back 31 pp: to be corrected—(there may
                be ab't 45)—don't you look out for anything stirring—it is small any
                how, &amp; mostly to untune (let down) clinch what I have said before, pass the
                fingers again carelessly over the strings &amp; probably some parrot-like
                repetitions &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">to close the book</span> avoiding any thing like
                trumpet blasts or attempts at them—intend it to be bound in with "November
                Boughs" &amp; make it supplementary part.</p>

                matters are going along satisfactorily—Dark glum day—&amp; I am too, but
                it is blessed to be no worse, &amp; even indication of turning better—am
                sitting here same way in big chair alone &amp;c:—drizzling out—God
                bless you &amp; all—</p>
