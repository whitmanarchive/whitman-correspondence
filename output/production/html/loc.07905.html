                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
