            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Postal of 18th just <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ , &amp; glad enough to hear from you all—the interval has been a long one—I supposed you were off some where—</p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special with me—After I returned from N Y middle of June, went down to my Jersey farm friends a couple of weeks—but they have moved into a new place, superior for their purposes, but to me the attraction had ceased, &amp; I left—Otherwise have been here in Camden all summer (I feel now as though I ought to have gone up &amp; room'd in your house &amp; boarded with Smith the last two months)—I still keep well—about the same as when you last saw me—may be a trifle ruggeder yet—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">All here well—I enclose you two letters from Mrs Gilchrist in England, &amp; one from my friend Mrs Botta, may interest you—I shall send you papers to-morrow—Weather fine yesterday &amp; to-day here—&amp; I am out enjoying it—(after fair days of pouring rain)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I often see your name, &amp; extracts, (sometimes quite long ones) in the papers hereabouts—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Love to 'Sula—</p>
