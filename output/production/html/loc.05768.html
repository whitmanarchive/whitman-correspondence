            <p class="tei_p"> The notion one is going to write a nice long letter is fatal to writing at all. And so I mean to scribble something, somehow, a little oftener
                &amp; make up in quantity for quality! For after all the great thing, the thing one
                wants, is to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">meet</span>—if not in the flesh—then in the spirit. A word will do
                it. I am getting on—my heart is in my work—&amp; though I have been long
                about it, it won't be long—but I think &amp; hope it will be strong. Quite a
                sprinkling of American friends—some new ones this spring—among them Mr.
                &amp; Mrs. Pennell<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> from Philadelphia—whom you
                know—we like them well—hope to see them again &amp; again. Also Miss
                Keyse (her sister married Emerson's son) from Concord, and the Lesleys—Mary
                Lesley has married &amp; gone to the West—St. Paul—has just got a little
                    son.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p"> How does the "little shanty" answer, I wonder? Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">3</a> has been
                painting some charming little bits in an old terraced garden here. I do wish you
                could hear Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">4</a> sing now; I am sure her voice would "go to the

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
