            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> The notion one is going to write a nice long letter is fatal to writing at all. And so I mean to scribble something, somehow, a little oftener
                &amp; make up in quantity for quality! For after all the great thing, the thing one
                wants, is to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">meet</span>—if not in the flesh—then in the spirit. A word will do
                it. I am getting on—my heart is in my work—&amp; though I have been long
                about it, it won't be long—but I think &amp; hope it will be strong. Quite a
                sprinkling of American friends—some new ones this spring—among them Mr.
                &amp; Mrs. Pennell from Philadelphia—whom you
                know—we like them well—hope to see them again &amp; again. Also Miss
                Keyse (her sister married Emerson's son) from Concord, and the Lesleys—Mary
                Lesley has married &amp; gone to the West—St. Paul—has just got a little
                    son.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> How does the "little shanty" answer, I wonder? Herby has been
                painting some charming little bits in an old terraced garden here. I do wish you
                could hear Giddy sing now; I am sure her voice would "go to the
                right spot," as you used to say. Good-bye, dearest friend. Love from all &amp; most
                from </p>
