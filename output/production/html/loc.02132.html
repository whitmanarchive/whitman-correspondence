                them will now read your works carefully and understandingly. I told them to come at

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse

                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
