                you. She has read yr books &amp; Bucke's ever since she has
                returned. She was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">finally</span> converted by the impression made
                by your personal presence. Says she felt that strange thrill (caused by yr great
                magnetism) that so many others have felt. She wrote to-day a tremendous arraingment
                of the Leslie <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb">Nutler</span> I told you of. She hauled him over the coals finely. I rubbed
                my hands in glee after quoting some of the good great fellows (in England &amp;
                America) who stand up for W. W. &amp; love him she says, "Thoreau thinks he is a great fellow, &amp; I think so, too." She says, "I saw
                with my own eyes, his nobility &amp; manners," &amp;c. She thoroughly understands and
                approves yr Children of Adam poems, too!

                always been a liberated spirit. Her father &amp; grandfather were deists.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I tell you she's a rare little soul, I wish you knew how keenly she pierces to the
                heart of shams &amp; humbugs.
                Yet generous enough to forgive everybody. Tears spring to her eyes at the recital of
                some noble heroic deed. All unfortunates flock to her.</p>
