                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
                    published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
