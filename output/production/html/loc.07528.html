            <p class="tei_p">Some days now since I have written—but nothing notable or
                different—rather a bad dull time the last two days—indigestion—bad
                weather—muggy warm, the air a sort of diluted tar—a promise of better
                weather hence, this evening—Herbert Gilchrist here quite
                a long while this afternoon—talks well—says his price for that portrait
                of me is 300 pounds—studio (&amp; address) 1708 Chestnut St. Phila—Harry
                    Stafford here too to-day, he is hard at work (printing
                &amp; his RR position)—looks well—physique—Horace regular—the books proceeding—Baker comes
                occasionally—no news yet of Ostler here—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-09-19">Wednesday noon Sept: 19 '88</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Feeling perceptibly better—fair bowel motion—(I take calomel
                powders)—has been dark moist bad forenoon but just now the sun is out
                good—the enclosed letter is from Logan Smith—&amp; the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> extract is from Habberton (staff H[erald])—I am sitting here in my big chair pretty
                comfortable considering—as I close—</p>
