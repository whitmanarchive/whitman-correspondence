                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
                    poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
                    with Whitman in 1919; see Philip W. Leon, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and Sir

                    dropped a line to the poet: "Herald wanted to do you a favor by early notice of
                    your new book. Sorry you didn't get the idea." On September 23, in an article
                    entitled "Walt Whitman's Words," a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> reporter,
                    probably John Habberton, quoted the following from his "notes of Whitman's
                    opinions, which were revised by him": "I am an old bachelor who never had a love
                    affair. Nature supplied the place of a bride, with suffering to be nursed and
                    scenes[?] to be poetically clothed." Walt Whitman denied that he had revised the
                    article (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

Despite the inaccuracies, the poet found
                    the piece "friendly"; (see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman
