                <span class="tei_salute">To Mr. Hotten,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to hear you are having Mr. Conways <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">potograph​ </span><span class="tei_corr">photograph​
        
      </span></span> engraved in place of the bad
                print now in the book. If a faithful presentation of
                that photograph can be given it will satisfy me well—of course it should be
                reproduced with all its shaggy, dappled, rough-skinned character &amp; not attempted
                to be smoothed, or prettyfied—(if in time I send the following
                hints)—let the costume be kept very simple &amp; broad, &amp; rather kept down
                too, little as there is of it—preserve the effect of the sweeping lines
                making all that fine free angle below the chin—I would suggest not to bring in
                so fully the shoulders &amp; bust as the photograph does—make only the
                    neck, the collar with the immediately
                neighboring part of the shirt delineated. You will see that the spot at the left
                side of the hair, near the temple, is a white blur, &amp; does not belong in the
                picture. The eyes part, and all around the eyes, try to re-produce fully &amp;
                faithfully, exactly as in the photograph.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hope you have a good artist at the work. It is perhaps worth your taking special
                pains about, both to achieve a successfull picture &amp; likeness, something
                characteristic, &amp; as certain to be a marked help to your edition of the book.
                Send me an early <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">proof of the engraving</span>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Thank you for the papers with notices in them—&amp; for your Academia criticism. Please continue to send any special notices. I receive them
                safely &amp; promptly. The London Review notice is reprinted here in Littell's
                Living Age. I should like to know who wrote the piece in the
                Morning Star—it flushed
                my friends &amp; myself too, like a sun-dash, brief, hot, &amp; dazzling.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have several things more to say, &amp; will write again soon—Also to Mr. Rossetti to whom,
                meantime, please offer my friendliest, truest regards.
            </p>
