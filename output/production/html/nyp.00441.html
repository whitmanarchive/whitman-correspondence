            <p class="tei_p">Ben Ticknor has just been here, to make a settlement of the L of G publication business between me and Osgood &amp; Co.—which settlement has been amicably effected—and O &amp; Co. have withdrawn &amp; given it up for good, &amp; made the plates &amp;c over to me—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What I write for is this:—Ben. tells me that the whole business originated from the State Attorney General Mr Marston, who (at the instance of certain parties) peremptorily instructed the Boston <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="District​ ">Dist.</span>​  Attorney Stevens to proceed against L of G. As I wrote you before, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">betes noir</span> were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">To a common prostitute</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A woman waits for me</span>. Unless those were left out he was instructed to indict and arrest to the law's extremity. (I believe I told you that Osgood &amp; Co. formally notified me that they would continue the publication if those were expurgated.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I do not myself feel any resentment toward O &amp; Co. for any thing done me or the book—They have acted with reference to conventional business &amp; other circumstances.
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Marston</span> is the target for you—If I learn more I will notify you—</p>
