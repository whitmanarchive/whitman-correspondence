                    still in the possession of Michael Doolady (a bookseller to whom Whitman wrote
                    on <a href="loc.01566">November 13, 1867</a>) on April 22, 1874. On
                    December 29, 1873, Walt Whitman withdrew his books from O'Kane, and also
                    dismissed Piper, the Boston outlet. At the same time he entrusted the whole
                    matter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Co., which went into bankruptcy in the following
                    year. Though Walt Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on <a href="loc.01717">April 22, 1874</a>, he later became hostile. Citing only the initials,
                    Richard Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (1883), in his
                    "official" biography (46), averred that O'Kane and Somerby, Butts's successor,
                    "took advantage of [Walt Whitman's] helplessness to embezzle the amounts
                    due—(they calculated that death would soon settle the score and rub it
                    out.)" This sounds like an interpolation composed by the poet himself; note also
                    Whitman's <a href="yal.00418">December 30, 1875</a>, letter to Jeannette
                    Gilder, in which he wrote, "every one of the three successive book agents I have
                    had in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds." In an address book (The Library of
                    Congress #108) Walt Whitman scrawled on a piece of O'Kane's stationery,
                    "rascal." </span></span> [<a href="#r0454">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01718_n2 note" id="loc.01718_n2"><span>Lee, Shepard, &amp; Dillingham,

                    In a letter on <a href="loc.01966">July 20, 1867</a>, John Townsend Trowbridge
                    wrote that William H. Piper &amp; Co. was willing to take 50 copies of the new
                    edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, and that he could personally
                    recommend the firm. The firm was advertised as Whitman's Boston agent in books
                    published in 1871 and 1872. </span></span> [<a href="#r0672">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">5. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01718_n3 note" id="loc.01718_n3"><span>Redfield sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic

                    Co., London booksellers. According to a statement dated December 31, 1872, the
                    firm had on hand at that time 48 copies of the prose tract and 41 copies of the
                    poetry (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Library of Congress).
                    According to a notation in his Commonplace Book, the account was closed in 1876,
                    when the firm sent $9 to Walt Whitman through William Michael Rossetti
                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In his <a href="duk.00668">December
                        27, 1873</a> letter, Whitman noted that Trübner also had
                    copies. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n0133">6. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0133 note" id="n0133"><span>Asa K. Butts was a New York bookseller at 39 Dey
                    Street. Walt Whitman was having difficulties— real or imaginary, as his
                    mother might have said—with booksellers. When Walt Whitman wrote this
                    letter, he had decided to let Butts, as he said, "have actual &amp; complete
                    control of the sales." Commenting on one of the letters of Butts, Walt Whitman
                    observed to Horace Traubel, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span> in 1889: "What a sweat I used to be in all the time . . . over
                    getting my damned books published! When I look back at it I wonder I didn't
                    somewhere or other on the road chuck the whole business into oblivion" (III,
                    561). Butts went bankrupt in 1874. </span></span> [<a href="#r0133">back</a>]</li><li id="n0356">7. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0356 note" id="n0356"><span>Lee, Shepard, &amp; Dillingham, publishers and

                    had recovered by February 1876, however, when they published S. B. Perry's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Manual of Bible Selections and Responsive Exercises</span>,

                    was Whitman's attempt to "celebrate in my own way, the modern engineering masterpieces
                    . . . the great modern material practical energy &amp; works," including
                    the completion of the Suez Canal (1869), the Union and Central Pacific transcontinental 
                    railroad (1869), and the completion of the Atlantic Cable (1866) (see Whitman's <a href="col.00002">April 22, 1870</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway). Although Whitman
                    submitted the poem to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Overland Monthly</span> on <a href="loc.01691">April 4, 1870</a>, it was rejected on <a href="loc.02301">April 13, 1870</a>, for being "too long and too

                        M.</span>" Conway, Walt Whitman's agent in England, was not able to sell the
                    poem to an English journal. John Burroughs observed in the second edition of his
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person</span> (1871),
                    123: "The manuscript of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Passage to India</span> was refused by
                    the monthly magazines successively in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and
                    London." The poem was eventually included in the final three editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, published in 1871, 1881, and 1891.
