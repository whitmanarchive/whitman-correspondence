      <p class="tei_p">Beyond O'Kane's copies of Leaves of Grass (200 or about), and the
        copies (27 was it?) of the '67 edition you got of Shephard, four
        or five weeks ago—with the remaining copies (if any) of the 25 sent by my order two
        months since to Piper &amp; Co.—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">there are, positively, no other
          copies in existence, &amp; of course none in the market</span>. There are no other copies in
        N.Y.—none in Boston—none in Washington—whatever you were "told"—none
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">anywhere</span> in America. A hundred copies were sent by me to England
        about a year &amp; a half ago. But these have certainly been
        mostly sold. I made &amp; exclusively own the plates, &amp; of course [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">indecipherable</span>]. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">What I told you in our interview, upon that subject, you must remember, &amp; can fully
        depend on &amp; act on. I have somewhere between 300 &amp; 350 of my little book of later
        poems, "As a Strong Bird on Pinions free," bound &amp; ready, I should like to furnish you
        with—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Should be willing—guaranteeing the just mentioned—to make over the whole of the
        copies L of G. and every thing to you on liberal terms, one half cash down, the remainder in
        three months—with a guarantee that no new edition of L of G. or any of these books
        shall be put out for at least six months. If you care to have the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sole
          &amp; exclusive</span> command of all my books in existence, take this offer. I am sick
        &amp; paralyzed—a tedious prospect still before me—&amp; should be glad to have
        the books off my hands. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">About Piper's debt, take <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this</span> note &amp; collect it when you go to
        Boston. The one I furnished you with, is for a wrong <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="amount​ ">am't</span>​ . Destroy it. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Please get the books from O'Kane, soon as convenient, &amp; send me receipt specifying
        number—also receipt for those of ed. '67. </p>
