                It is a mighty pretty little book, beautifully printed on first class paper and whatever may be said (from a literary standpoint) 
                about a falling off in verse or prose (which I neither disagree nor altogether agree with) I say now and will always maintain 
                that the little volume is exactly what it should be from a far higher and more important point of view. We have now (I think) 
                the whole man as far as he could be given in this way and (as far as I can see) there is no need of writing any more—still if 
                there should be more to come we shall be glad to have it.
                I am pretty busy putting things in shape for my two months absence.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> Weather &amp; grounds perfect here.

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as

                    and June 1891 both to Whitman and Horace Traubel make clear, he was going abroad
                    to establish a foreign market for his gas and fluid meter, a subject to which he
                    referred constantly in his communications but which the poet studiously
                    ignored. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
