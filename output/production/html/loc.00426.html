               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother received a letter from you yesterday  I got one the day before. Mother did not let me see her letter but Mat says that she understands that you say that you think about coming home. I hope dear Walt, that you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">will</span> come and that soon  I think if you should come just now you might be able to do Andrew considerable good  He is in a very bad way and I really fear, under the present circumstances that he will not last long. Dear Walt I wish that I could do something more for Andrew, but I have to work all the time, almost day and night and another thing I think he would be guided more by your advice than any one elses  That damed infernal robber the doctor that he has been with (Andrew has paid him $95 and been getting worse all the time) told Andrew yesterday that he must not come there again till he brought him $45 more. Only think of it. The infernal son of a bitch. I would like to hang him for a thousand years, ten times a second. I dont care anything about it for the good that I think that he could do Andrew but that he Andrew thinks that perhaps if he could pay him $45 he could do something for him. The very fact that the scoundrel wants the money in advance is enough  Dear Walt do come home if only for a short time  And unless you come quite soon you certainly will never see Andrew alive. Will you write me at once if you can come.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother Mat and Sis are all suffering from bad colds, Mother particularly I think is failing rapidly. I do so wish that I could see you and have a good talk abt family affairs  I am in an awful hurry or would write more. To day I have to go through the whole line of conduit</p>
