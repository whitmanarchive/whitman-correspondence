                        slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not reproduced here). Edwin
                        Haviland Miller assigned this letter the approximate date October 5, 1863 on
                        the basis of Walt Whitman's writing "Mother, you dont know how pleased I was
                        to read what you wrote about little sis," apparently in response to Louisa
                        Van Velsor Whitman's remark that Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha
                        Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's daughter Jessie Louisa was "well and fat" though
                        her older sister Manahatta was "obstropolous" (see Walt's <a href="loc.00794">October 6, 1863</a> letter to Louisa). Miller's
                        date is more accurate than Bucke's, but since Louisa wrote on a Friday, the
                        date proposed by Miller should be changed to the most recent Friday before
                        Walt's letter, October 2.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The letter may date to even a week earlier, September 25. Walt in his <a href="loc.00791">September 29, 1863</a> letter to Louisa reassured
                        her about Union generals Ambrose Burnside and George Gordon Meade, and Walt
                        may well have responded directly to Louisa's concern that "rebels will get
                        the better of Burny" and her wish that "mead was removed." However, Walt had
                        also discussed Burnside (but not Meade) in his <a href="loc.00789">September 15, 1863</a> letter to Louisa. He also yearned regularly
                        for news about Mattie and Jeff, their daughters, and Walt's brother Andrew
                        Jackson Whitman. The matter of Burnside and Meade is suggestive but not
                        conclusive. The earliest possible date for this letter derives from the
                        distance since Andrew's most recent acute episode of illness—Louisa's
                        remarks suggest some improvement in his eating—and the specificity of
                        Walt's many queries: whether soldiers remain on Fort Greene and whether she,
                        Louisa, could forward copies of the Brooklyn newspapers, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Union</span> and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span>. As
                        Andrew's acute episode of illness had passed and this letter addresses
                        neither of Walt's queries, this letter is unlikely to date to the Friday
                        immediately following Walt's September 15 letter or earlier. This letter may
                        follow Louisa's <a href="duk.00429">September 5–23, 1863</a>
                        letter to Walt, but that too is a matter of interpretation. The Friday
                        preceding the date proposed by Miller, October 2, 1863, is more probable,
                        but September 25, 1863 is also possible.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
