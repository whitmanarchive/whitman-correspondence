      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got my letter Monday 12th (written Sunday.) I am still improving—
        (I don't feel quite as well to-day as for some days past—
        but it is a great advance on what I have been)—&amp; am in good spirits—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Dear mother, I feel very anxious about you<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—it is very distressing to have the nervous system affected, 
        it always makes one feel so discouraged, that is the worst of it—Mother, 
        I am afraid you are more unwell than you say—I think about it night &amp; day—
        the enclosed letter came to me yesterday—Jeff sent it to me, by mistake 
        (may-be one for me has gone to you)—I got another letter from Jeff to-day<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—all are well—Jeff too is anxious about you—
        Mother, try to write a line soon after you get this—I am writing 
        this in the office—Mother, I shall come on—
      </p>

                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman explained that her "nervous system is very much out of

                    Collection, Duke University). She thought that she would improve if she got away
                    from Camden. Louisa, unknown to her mother-in-law, also wrote to Walt Whitman
                    about the same time (The Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00318_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00318_n2"><span>Writing on <a href="loc.00473">May 9, 1873</a>, Jeff was concerned about the situation
                    in Camden, Louisa's stinginess, George's failure "to make things good and happy"
                    for his mother, and the possibility of having her go to Washington (Charles E.
