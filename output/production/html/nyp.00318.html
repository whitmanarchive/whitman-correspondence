      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got my letter Monday 12th (written Sunday.) I am still improving—
        (I don't feel quite as well to-day as for some days past—
        but it is a great advance on what I have been)—&amp; am in good spirits—
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Dear mother, I feel very anxious about you—it is very distressing to have the nervous system affected, 
        it always makes one feel so discouraged, that is the worst of it—Mother, 
        I am afraid you are more unwell than you say—I think about it night &amp; day—
        the enclosed letter came to me yesterday—Jeff sent it to me, by mistake 
        (may-be one for me has gone to you)—I got another letter from Jeff to-day—all are well—Jeff too is anxious about you—
        Mother, try to write a line soon after you get this—I am writing 
        this in the office—Mother, I shall come on—
      </p>
