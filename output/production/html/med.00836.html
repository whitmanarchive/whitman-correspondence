            <p class="tei_p">Eakins' "pict." is ab't finished—It is a portrait of power
                and realism, ("a poor, old, blind, despised and dying king"). Things with me ab't
                the same. Mrs. D[avis] is well—is in the back room
                working. My canary is singin' away as I write.</p>
