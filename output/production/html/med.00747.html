                    (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
                    introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
                    the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
                    carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman, the Man</span> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see

                    (1869–1902?) was Whitman's young Camden friend, who drove the poet's horse
                    and buggy, lived for a while in Whitman's house, and accompanied Whitman on
                    numerous trips. Duckett later established a career in the telegraphy industry;
                    he lived and worked in Ohio and North Carolina before passing away in his native
                    Philadelphia as a result of alcoholism in about 1902. For more information on
