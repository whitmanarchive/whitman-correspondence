                        <a href="loc.01131">July 11</a>, Burroughs informed Whitman that "we
                    got our baby just as the heat began, July 1st, &amp; we have had our hands full.
                    . . . He is a bright little fellow &amp; I expect we shall 'set a store' by him
                    as the old women say." This adopted child was Julian Burroughs
                    (1878–1954), who later became a landscape painter, writer, and
                    photographer. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
