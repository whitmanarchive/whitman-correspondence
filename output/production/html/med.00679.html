            <p class="tei_p">I kept staying &amp; staying in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​ —but left yesterday in the 4 p m train, had a fine run to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​  &amp; here I am to-day in my regular den—all the better for my month's trip—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new—brother &amp; sister well as usual—my two nieces, Jeff's daughters, are here &amp; are a great comfort to me. Hot weather, awful—yet I am standing it well so far. I suppose you got the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> of July 4 with my letter in. And the box of Graham biscuits by Express—(Of course you know they must be soak'd half an hour or more in milk or water—I sweeten mine with sugar, but some dont like it)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">How are you getting along this hot weather? &amp; how is that baby?</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I eat my biscuits <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">for supper</span> only—have two or three of them in a bowl soak'd for an hour, &amp; the water pour'd off, &amp; then a little milk, &amp; plenty of sugar—they must be fixed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">just right</span>, or they ain't good—</p>
