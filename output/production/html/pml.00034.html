            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I will write you a line, to begin my letter, before I leave the office—I have been sitting here alone for a couple of hours, having a good time, all by myself, nobody in the building besides me, but the watchman—Mama dear, I suppose you got the order in my last—I have also sent you the old Franklin Almanac—write if it arrived safe. There is nothing new or special—I am well, &amp; only hope your cold is better—I sometimes think a bad cold is about as aggravating as any thing one can have—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I saw Grant to-day on the avenue walking by himself—(I always salute him, &amp; he does the same to me.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been hard at work all the forenoon—it is a cloudy day here, threatening rain—Mama dear, I don't seem to think of any thing to write about this morning—Love to you—&amp; to George &amp; Lou if they are there.</p>
