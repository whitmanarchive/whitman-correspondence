                    mentioned pseudonymously as Timothy Titcomb in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00268">September 27, 1867</a> letter to William D. O'Connor, was an editor of
                    the Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> from 1850 to 1862, and author
                    of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Titcomb's Letters to Young People, Simple and Married</span>
                    (New York: C. Scribner, 1858). While he was editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's Monthly</span> (1870–1881), Whitman submitted poems to him.
                    At this time Holland was also editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century
                        Magazine</span>. On two occasions Whitman recalled that he had sent poems to
                    Holland at the suggestion of John Swinton (Horace Traubel, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">1:184</a>; <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.50.html">4:326–327</a>). This letter was probably written in 1875, since one
                    of the poems was "Eidólons," which appeared in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> on <a href="per.00141">February 19,
                        1876</a>. The following year, Holland issued a hostile criticism in the
                    May 1876 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's Monthly</span>, 12 (1876),
                    123–125. Holland's lengthy (lost) reply "was offensive, low, bitter,
                    inexcusable" (Horace Traubel, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span> [1906–1996], <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.48.html">3:327</a>). In an interview in 1879, Whitman complained that many
                    American magazines were "in the hands of old fogies like Holland or fops like
                    Howells" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>, 14 [1942–43],
                    145–146). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
