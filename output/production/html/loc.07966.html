                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    designed an elaborate granite tomb, which P. Reinhalter &amp; Co. of

                    summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor,

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
