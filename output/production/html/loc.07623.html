            <p class="tei_p">Of course the main tho't has been yesterday, &amp; is to-day, the death of
                    O'C[onnor]—I enclose the letter of Mrs: O'C rec'd yesterday—</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">(Another death here, old Mrs: Mapes, buried this afternoon,)— Y'r letters come &amp; are welcom'd—(if you sent
                one with the calo[mel] prescription, however, it never reach'd me—it was but
                really rec'd two days since)—Am feeling sufficiently easy today—my
                out-door wheelchair has come &amp; is very satisfactory (both to Ed &amp; me) &amp;
                I intended to get out this forenoon, but I took a rather laborious bath at 10½,
                &amp; felt some exhausted, &amp; shall probably get out a little this
                afternoon—pleasant weather, not quite so warm to-day, but has been markedly
                warm—fair bowel action this forenoon—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Some of the friends here in Camden, (lawyers, a teacher or
                two, an editor, Tom Harned, &amp; others) have laid out
                a sort of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">commemoration formal dinner</span> for my arriving my
                70th year old terminus—a good dinner, tickets ($5), toasts, speeches,
                &amp;c.—no wine—you have probably rec'd the newspaper item f'm
                    Horace—I have let them go on their own way, as they
                have set their hearts upon it, &amp; they are all quite fellows of love &amp;
                respect—but I have definitely told them it is not certain I shall get there in
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">propria personae</span>—&amp; if so (wh' I will if
                practicable) w'd only show myself &amp; acknowledge the compliment wh' seems to be
                no more than decent—tho' the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">jamboree</span> does not
                present itself as appropriate, or particularly encouragable to my mind—Well
                we shall see—The pocket-bound ed'n is getting on smoothly, &amp; no mishap or hitch
                yet—the printed sheets are at the binder's—Horace sold a big book to-day &amp; McKay another—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well I went out in the wheel chair
                yesterday afternoon &amp; was probably out an hour &amp; a half—every thing
                work'd well—the chair is a success &amp; sits &amp; goes easy—Ed of course propell'd me—Shall go out again
                to-day—the weather continues fine, very mild—I sweat quite
                freely—had some good asparagus for my breakfast (sent f'm my brother's garden,
                Burlington)—Harry Stafford was here yesterday, he is
                pretty thin, is still working managing the RR station at Marlton, NJ—all the
                rest ab't as usual—Wm Ingram comes often.</p>
