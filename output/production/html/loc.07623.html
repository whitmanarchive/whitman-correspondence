                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
