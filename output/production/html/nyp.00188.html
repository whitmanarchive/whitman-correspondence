                    Washington on June 22, 1864. On July 5, 1864, Ellen O'Connor wrote: "It will be
                    two weeks to-morrow since you left us, and I have missed you terribly every
                    minute of the time. I think I never in my life felt so wholly blue and unhappy
                    about any one's going away as I did, and have since, about your going. I began
                    to be really superstitious I felt so badly. I did not think that you were going
                    to die, but I could not possibly overcome the feeling that our dear and pleasant
                    circle was broken, and it seemed to me that we four [the O'Connors, Charles
                    Eldridge, and Whitman] should not be together any more as we have been. . . .
                    Ah! Walt, I don't believe other people need you as much as we do. I am <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sure</span> they don't need you as much as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I</span> do" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
