                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Rossetti:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have just received, &amp; have considered your letter of November 17. In order that
                there be the frankest understanding with respect to my position, I hasten to write
                you that the authorization in my letter of November 1st to Mr. Conway, for you, to
                make verbal alterations, substitute words, &amp;c. was meant to be construed as an
                answer to the case presented in Mr. Conway's letter of October 12.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> Mr. Conway stated the case of a volume of selections in which it had been
                decided that the poems reprinted in London should appear verbatim, &amp; asking my
                authority to change certain words in the Preface to first edition of poems,
                    &amp;c.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I will be candid with you, &amp; say I had not the slightest idea of applying my
                authorization to a reprint of the full volume of my poems. As such a volume was not
                proposed, &amp; as your courteous &amp; honorable course &amp; attitude called &amp;
                call for no niggardly or hesitating response from me, I penned that authorization,
                &amp; did not feel to set limits to it. But abstractly &amp; standing alone, &amp;
                not read in connection with Mr. C's letter of October 12, I see now it is far too
                loose, &amp; needs distinct guarding.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I cannot &amp; will not consent of my own volition, to countenance an expurgated
                edition of my pieces. I have steadily refused to do so under seductive offers, here
                in my own country, &amp; must not do so in another country.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I feel it due to myself to write you explicitly thus, my dear Mr. Rossetti, though it
                may seem harsh &amp; perhaps ungenerous. Yet I rely on you to absolve me, sooner or
                later. Could you see Mr. Conway's letter of October 12, you would, I think, more
                fully comprehend the integrity of my explanation.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have to add that the points made in that letter in relation to the proposed
                reprint, as originally designed, exactly correspond with those, on the same subject,
                in your own late letter—&amp; that the kind &amp; appreciative tone of both
                letters is in the highest degree gratifying, &amp; is most cordially &amp;
                affectionately responded to by me—&amp; that the fault of sending so loose an
                authorization has surely been, to a large degree, my own.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">And now, my friend, having set myself right on that matter, I proceed to say, on the
                other hand, for you, &amp; for Mr. Hotten, that if, before the arrival of this
                letter, you have practically invested in, &amp; accomplished, or partially
                accomplished, any plan, even contrary to this letter, I do not expect you to abandon
                it, at loss of outlay, &amp;c. but shall <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bona fide</span> consider
                you blameless if you let it go on, &amp; be carried out, as you may have arranged.
                It is the question of the authorization of an expurgated edition proceeding from me,
                that deepest engages me. The facts of the different ways, one way or another way, in
                which the book may appear in England, out of influences not under the shelter of my
                umbrage, are of much less importance to me. After making the foregoing explanation,
                I shall, I think, accept kindly whatever happens. For I feel, indeed know, that I am
                in the hands of a friend, &amp; that my pieces will receive that truest, brightest
                of light &amp; perception coming from love. In that, all other &amp; lesser
                requisites become pale.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It would be better, in any Introduction, to make no allusion to me, as authorizing,
                or not prohibiting, &amp;c.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The whole affair is somewhat mixed—&amp; I write offhand<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> to catch to-morrow's New York steamer. But I guess you will
                pick out my meaning. Perhaps, indeed, Mr. Hotten has preferred to go on after the
                original plan—which, if so, saves all trouble.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have to add that I only wish you could know how deeply the beautiful personal tone
                &amp; passages of your letter of November 17, have penetrated and touched me.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
                It is such things that go to our hearts, and reward us, &amp; make up for all else,
                for years. Permit me to offer you my friendship.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent you hence Nov. 23d<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> a
                letter, through Mr. Conway. Also a copy of Mr. Burroughs's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes</span>, Mr. O'Connor's pamphlet, &amp; some papers containing criticisms on
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Also, later, a prose article of mine
                named <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span>, in a magazine.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Let me know how the work goes on, what shape it takes, &amp;c. Finally I charge you
                to construe all I have written, through my declared &amp; fervid realization of your
                goodness toward me, nobleness of intention, &amp;, I am fain to hope, personal, as,
                surely, literary &amp; moral sympathy &amp; attachment. And so, for the present,
                Farewell.</p>

                    disturbed by the following passage in Rossetti's letter: "But now, after your
                    letter [referring to Whitman's <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/tei/pri.00011.html">November 1, 1867</a> letter to Moncure D. Conway] it seems to me that all
                    or most of these poems, with some minimum of verbal modification or excision,
                    may very properly be included: &amp; indeed that there is nothing to prevent a
                    reprint of the revised copy of your complete poems (which you sent to Mr Conway)
                    coming out at once, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">instead</span> of the mere
                    selection—subject only to modification or excision here &amp; there as
                    above named" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.44.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996], 3:300).
                    However, in his next letter, on <a href="loc.01877">December 8, 1867</a>,
                    Rossetti informed Walt Whitman that the publisher was unwilling to substitute a
                    complete edition for the selections because printing was too far advanced. In
                    the same letter, Rossetti stated the "two rules" which he had followed in making
                    his selections: "1, to omit <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">entirely</span> every poem which
                    contains passages or words which modern squeamishness can raise an objection
                    to—&amp; 2, to include, from among the remaining poems, those which I most
                    entirely &amp; intensely admire." See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/rossetti.html">Poems by Walt Whitman</a></span> (London: John Camden Hotten, 1868),

                    of the truest &amp; most prized distinctions of my writing career to be
                    associated, in however modest a capacity, with the works of so great a poet
                    &amp; noble-hearted a man as you." And on <a href="loc.01878">December 16,
                        1867</a> he replied to Walt Whitman's offer of "friendship": "To be
                    honoured by your friendship is as great a satisfaction &amp; distinction as my
                    life has presented or ever can present. I respond to it with all warmth &amp;
                    reverence, &amp; the Atlantic seemed a very small space between us while I read
                    and re-read your letter." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pri.00013_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pri.00013_n5"><span>The letter was written on
