                    has slipped away since my last letter to you. I have now been here in North Wales
                    for nearly six weeks, having retreated to these mountains very soon after returning
                    from Paris. I am lodged very comfortably in the cottage of a
                    quarry-man,—William Davies,<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">12</a> who works at <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Festiniog​ </span></span>, 
                    5 or 6 miles from here. He is a very good type,—healthy,
                    well-built, good-natured, impulsive, with the over-carefulness of the average
                    Welshman tempered by his experiences of American life, for "he went to the states,"
                    as they say here, some years back, &amp; travelled far &amp; wide, working in mines &amp;
                    quarries. Even now he does not talk English very fluently, &amp; prefers his native
                    Welsh, in which he gives me lessons every night on his return from work. Many people
                    in the district speak no English at all. The Welsh are a peculiarly adhesive race, &amp;
                    stick to their language &amp; old customs, &amp;, it must be added, to their money, with a
                    somewhat dubious devotion. An infusion<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03338.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03338.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03338.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03338.002.jpg</span> of American generosity &amp; freedom would do them great good. As it
                    is, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Methodism &amp;
                        money-making</span> is the formula of the lives of most of them,—their
                    redeeming quality being their love of music &amp; oratory!</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I found the change here from Paris very striking. The French are exactly opposite in
                    every way,—those who live in Paris at any rate. There the sunshine &amp; the
                    gaiety &amp; general friendliness are very pleasantly in contrast with the grey skies &amp;
                    the somewhat
                    <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">montonous​ </span></span> routine of London. Paris is a sort of ideal New York,—a New York
                    touched with Romance &amp; the finer graces of the Past, but without the youthful
                    ardency that pulses in Mannahatta. Paris would delight you greatly, I know, though
                    you might have misgivings at last about a life so frivolously secular, so wanting
                    (as it seemed to me) in humane &amp; religious aims of the higher kind. But this
                    notwithstanding, the charm of those sunny streets, &amp; good-natured 
                    irresponsible faces, is something to
                    remember.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">The Exhibition, I daresay, you have heard enough of. What struck me most of
                    all—much more than the Eiffel Tower &amp; other nine-days wonders, was the endless
                    cosmopolitan ebb &amp; flow of the peoples of the world,—American, Arabian,
                    Japanese, Indian, Egyptian, English, Norse:—a wonderful, indescribable <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Concourse de Monde</span>!</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I must stop here to-day—Post-time!—hoping to take up the story at greater
                    length shortly. Luck has been dead against me of late. I suppose I shall have to
                    turn Quarry-man
                    presently,—Scottish Art Review &amp; other papers not paying up!</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,
