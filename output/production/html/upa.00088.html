                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Herbert Gilchrist</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of the 10th came to-day &amp; is welcome. Every thing goes on much the same
                here. Quite biting wintry cold to-day after a long stormy spell. I am ab't the same
                as when you were here—&amp; am sitting by the window in the big chair. Mrs.
                    D is well. We have been feasting on some nice stewed
                quinces and quince jelly—a triumph of Mrs. D's cookery—we wish you were
                here to have some—the very color goes beyond all description. I have no doubt
                the portrait fully justifies all encomiums there, and goes beyond them. —In a good light &amp; in a frame it must indeed
                appear well—having <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">neither</span> here, &amp; intentionally
                hung where it would be tested to the severest—Success to the painter of
                it—&amp; to it (the nobly carnal &amp; Shaksperian work)—I have rec'd a nice letter from Herbert Horne—have heard
                from Morgan Brown, who is well &amp; remains in N Y
                state—the Smiths are here, &amp; come to see me—Morse is here—has been here every day this week—Mrs. Stafford was here Wednesday, is well, as are all the family—But it
                is growing too dark to write—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Sunday forenoon early—Oct 23</span>—The sun is shining
                bright—I have had my breakfast (pann'd oysters toast &amp; coffee) &amp; in
                half an hour I shall start in my light wagon &amp; Nettie for Glendale—you ought to be here to accompany me—the air is full of
                sheen &amp; oxygen with a pleasant coolness—write soon again. Give my best
                regards to Ernest Rhys—a synopsis of his "New
                Poetry" lecture has been published here in the "Critic"—Well I must be off—</p>
