                quinces and quince jelly—a triumph of Mrs. D's cookery—we wish you were
                here to have some—the very color goes beyond all description. I have no doubt
                the portrait fully justifies all encomiums there, and goes beyond them.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> —In a good light &amp; in a frame it must indeed

                    this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the sect of
                    his orthodox family." An entry in Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 29 reads:
