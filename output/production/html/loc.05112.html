            <p class="tei_p">At last I find myself able to write to you, having got myself moored in a quiet nook
                after much hurried journeying. When I received your letter with the poems, I was
                staying with a married sister<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> in the county Wicklow.
                Then my father got very ill &amp; I had to go down &amp; see him (he is all right now.)
                Then business in London, tedious travelling half across Europe, &amp; now my wife and
                I are fixed in a little German valley for the summer. There are mineral springs and
                baths here; she was ordered <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01000_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01000_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01000_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01000_large.jpg</span> to come for her health, which has not been very good
                lately—but there is every likelihood of its mending now. This is a very
                pleasant place—a long, rather narrow valley with low hills, covered with
                pinewood, at each side—at one end of it stands the village of Elster, bowered
                in dense foliage, oak and chestnut; with highroofed houses, a few large hotels, a
                rather grand looking building,—the Bath House—surrounding the mineral
                springs. When you climb to the top of a hill you see leagues on leagues of grass
                country, no mountains, but low undulations with quaintly built villages set in their
                folds, and covered often with dark tracts of pine forest. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01001_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01001_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01001_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01001_large.jpg</span> There are few visitors here, for
                this is not one of the fashionable watering places; our countrymen &amp; women have
                not found it out and vulgarized it yet. These Germans I admire more and
                more—if they keep their present characteristics, what a nation they will be
                sometime! Their life is simple, friendly, humane, unembarrassed; the poor have
                leisure and use it well, the rich do not strive, (as periodically in England) to "do
                their duty to the lower classes" by subscribing to benevolent schemes &amp;
                inventing elaborate machinery for the reclamation of criminals,—they meet
                their labourers, servants, &amp;c in a perfectly natural manner, as man with man and
                other bonds are established than
                those which unite the payer and the payee. As a nation, high and low, they have
                intelligence, and what is more, spirituality—life is not measured by its
                value in £.s.d.</p>

                foreigners, even aristocratic Germans, can little know—without complaint, or
                resent it only in a petty, spiteful way. And they have an innate dread and respect
                for an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">official</span>—anyone in a uniform—they
                surround him with something of the divinity that used to hedge kings when
                Shakespeare wrote. They are a people whom I love to mix with. I mean the common
                folk, the others I rarely meet with, for I scarcely see anyone, being buried a good

            <p class="tei_p">In Dublin I came across a man I had heard much of but never seen before, one Standish
                O'Grady, a barrister who drifted into authorship, has written part of a History of
                Ireland, collecting, translating, piecing together, Homeric fashion, old bardic lays
                preserved from pagan times, of Irish heroes and gods. He is going to bring the
                history down to the present day.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I met him at Dowden's
                    first, often afterwards, &amp; we
                arranged for a walk on the Wicklow mountains, Dowden, O'Grady, two others &amp;
                myself. When the day came only O'Grady and I appeared at the rendezvous, &amp; we
                had a splendid day of it. I never met anyone, I think, whose mind answered so well
                to mine. We had been travelling on parallel roads of thought for some time—now

                together. Each had help to give and each needed
                help; above all we helped each other to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">realize</span>. I love
                many persons, but him with that nearest, most contented love—him and one
                other. That other is now a schoolmaster in South Africa.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>

                the clouds! I send you some stanzas about my day's walk with O'Grady (I found out
                shortly that he was a lover and disciple of yours, and we talked much of you).</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Thank you very much for the two poems.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I have put them in
                the Passage to India. It was very kind of you to try to get 'Calvin Harlowe'
                published, but I fear it is too rough. I could mend it a good deal. It was written
                quickly, the subject filled me and I hammered out the verses &amp; left them without
                a touch of the file. So too with those I send you—but I don't think I ever

                    Standish O'Grady (1846–1928) were an inspiration to the great Irish
                    Literary Revival. He has often been referred to as the father of this movement.
                    Between 1878 and 1880, he published the two volumes of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History
