                presenting the bill so soon Jeffy
                told him we wanted A little time
                but i paid it) it was 52 dollars
                every thing about it was conducted
                with the utmost quietness and
                respect with no bussell nor
                confusion if i could have had

                out in A black frock coat
                of Georges and vest and shirt
                looked as if he was asleep i
                never in all my life saw any

                and he said he would come
                up in an hour it was late in

                i said well perhaps it would
                be best) but in the mean time
                some of nances acquaintences
                came there and made a great
                time said they would go and
                get frank stryker<a href="#n19" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r19">15</a>

                over so she came round with
                a great adue so i got Jeffy
                to go down again and he came
                up and was brought round
                and put in mrs brown s<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">16</a>

                too the next morning she went

                a great adieu said we had
                taken him away from her and
                so that evening cornell came

                time i had the children here
                2 days and her too after

                    <p class="tei_p">This letter dates to December 16 or December 17, 1863. Richard Maurice Bucke
                        dated this letter to mid-December on an accompanying slip of paper held in
                        the Trent Collection (not reproduced here). Edwin Haviland Miller estimated
                        December 15?, 1863, a Tuesday (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                        1961–77], 1:189, n. 75).Based on inferences from contextual clues in
                        Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters from sons George Washington Whitman,
                        Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and Walt during the same week, this letter
                        should be assigned to Wednesday or Thursday, not the Tuesday proposed by
                        Miller.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This letter is the second that Louisa wrote to Walt following Andrew Jackson
                        Whitman's death on December 3. In it, she reports receiving two letters on
                        the day she is writing, one from Walt and one from his brother George.
                        Because she quotes almost verbatim from George's letter in her own letter,
                        she had received his <a href="duk.00348">December 9, 1863</a> letter
                        from Camp Pittman in Kentucky. Given typical mail times, Walt's <a href="loc.00805">December 15, 1863</a> letter to Louisa (from
                        Washington, D.C.) arrived in Brooklyn on the same day as George's December 9
                        letter.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Jeff's letter on Jesse Whitman's disturbing outburst after Andrew Whitman's
                        death provides further corroborating detail. According to Louisa, Jeff
                        departed for Springfield, Massachusetts on Monday "this week," and he was
                        expected back before the end of the week. Jeff informed Walt that he arrived
                        back at Springfield "on Monday—yesterday" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> letter to Walt). Jeff's date
                        and Louisa's date for Jeff's departure for Springfield are identical. Jeff
                        in his letter described Jesse's outburst toward his wife and daughter
                        Manahatta just after Andrew's death. Because Louisa does not mention Jesse's
                        outburst at all, she was responding to Walt's December 15, 1863 letter, in
                        which he sought more details about Andrew's funeral. Louisa did not know
                        that Walt would soon receive the harrowing account of Jesse's outburst in
                        Jeff's letter: Louisa had downplayed the seriousness of Jesse's threats
                        toward Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman and daughter Manahatta
                        in her <a href="duk.00431">December 4–5, 1863</a> letter to
                        Walt. That this letter dates within a week or two of Andrew's December 1863
                        death is indisputable. Since Louisa has received Walt's December 15 letter
                        on the day she wrote this letter, since George's letter probably arrived on
                        the same day, and since her date for Jeff's departure is consistent with
                        Jeff's December 15 letter from Springfield, this letter dates either to
                        December 16 (Wednesday) or December 17, 1863.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00467_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00467_n1"><span>Hannah Louisa (Whitman)

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
