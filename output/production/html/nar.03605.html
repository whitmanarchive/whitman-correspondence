                <span class="tei_salute">Attorney General.</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I hereby respectfully make application for the office of Pardon Clerk, now vacant in
                the Department of Justice.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have served in the Department under Attorney Generals Speed, Stanbery, Browning, Evarts, Hoar, &amp; yourself—am familiar
                with the general routine of the office (am the oldest in continuous service of any
                of the present clerks)—think I could soon learn the special duties of the
                pardon desk—and hope I should conscientiously seek to perform them, both with
                regard to their great official, and still greater moral obligations.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I would refer to Mr. Speed and Mr. Stanbery, Attorneys General, &amp; Mr.
                Ashton, Assistant Attorney General, under whom I have acted as clerk,
                some of them for several years—and to Mr. Pleasants, late Chief Clerk—and if
                agreeable to you, or desirable, would bring written testimonials from them.</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Very respectfully,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>

            

                <p class="tei_p">Should it not be convenient to grant the foregoing application I respectfully ask
                    to be promoted to a fourth-class clerkship, to date from 1st. of February,
                    1871.
                </p>
