                breakfast &amp; had a pleasant time, I saw Emerson &amp; spoke with him. He seemed

                fearful chasm in his mind &amp; he is hardly able to bridge it over, in conversation.
                He does not remember the name of his own State. Whittier<a href="#n1029" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1029">3</a> was standing by him &amp;

                then spoke to Whittier: he seemed to know me well &amp; said he had read all I had
                published &amp; was complimentary. Emerson is thin &amp; sharp &amp; his hair is

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting

                    Burroughs. Holmes remained ambivalent about Whitman's poetry. He married Amelia
                    Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later Supreme

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
