            <p class="tei_p">I send you some papers to while away the time—Was out yesterday driving in the
                country—never did the spring impress me more—it was just the right
                temperature—the very sun &amp; wind and grass with sort o' human
                relations—(what a beautiful object is a young wheat field! what
                color!)—Had a good supper, oysters &amp; champagne, at my friends the

                day—</p>
