                    Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), one of the most influential British writers of

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we

                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His

                    (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
                    rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.

                    Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
                    although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
                    When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01837">August 13,
                        1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another

                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the

                    He informed Whitman in the <a href="loc.01837">August 13, 1874</a>, letter
                    that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                    Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                    that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                    Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                    profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                    after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
