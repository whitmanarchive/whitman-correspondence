            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The old war refrain—"All's quiet on the Potomac"—seems 
                to have a new
                rendering in my thought as I go about my daily work: "All silent in Camden." I hear
                nothing &amp; see nothing in the public prints. But I dare say if I could cross the
                old ferry &amp; stop at "328"—I suppose you still insist on your own
                number—I should find life enough vocal &amp; contented.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I frequently chance upon your friends here in this city. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03203.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> One such wrote a 2 column article for
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Evening Journal</span> of May 31. He allows me to send it to
                you on condition that I will charge you to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">return it</span>, as
                it is the only copy he owns, &amp; wishes it for his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">scrap
                    book.</span> He is an Englishman—knows George Elliot,
                    Tennyson, Carpenter, I believe &amp;
                others. Prof Dowden of Somersham—one of your English
                friends, is his friend. He detests Swinburn, &amp; will have an
                article in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> Sunday on Gladstone's saying that .S would be next poet-laureate.

                He asked how you took Swinburn's "apostacy." I answered,—"Serenely." But he is
                a bit mad, &amp; says he has long been so knowing the "sham" that Swinburn is.</p> 

            <p class="tei_p">This man's name is Henry Latchford. He was sent to me the other
                day by Mr Dalton, the Ethical preacher here. He seems a man of ideas &amp; good
                sympathies—is a journalist—independent; that is, not attached to one
                journal, but writing for several on topics of his own selection. He came and chatted
                with me an hour or so, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03203.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                and, on departing, asked permission to write a paragraph for the journal about my
                work. I enclose the "paragraph." He got some things mixed &amp; not as I would have
                had it stand, had I seen the proof—or knowing he was going to "report" at such
                length. One thing, I would not have spoken of your Georgia friend as a "nuisance." Nor did I <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">imply</span>. I recall just what I said. "He stayed some time
                &amp; almost came to be a nuisance, but made up for

              it in part at least, by the bright things he would say, &amp; then told "old varmint"
                    story. I have always kept green a kind feeling for
                the old man, for there was something rather poetic in his leaving his home &amp;
                journeying so far to see the man whose poems had so much interested him. Peace be to
                him, any way, &amp; may he not see this half-unkind printed word of mine.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nor did I quite say that you get "tired &amp; sleepy." I think I said something about
                your sitting silently <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03203.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                museing—or something like that. I don't remember that he asked me the question
                he puts in print at all. But it fitted in for him to report that <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_bbb">"property" recital</span>.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But he made the worst mess about the Holmes talk, &amp; my
                contempt for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">facts</span>. I was only arguing as to what the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fact</span> is, in any portraiture, &amp; against reliance on the
                merely critical faculty—the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">conscious</span>
                criticism—or fault-finding, tinkering criticism. That was where "brains" got
                in the way. Holmes never cried, "Hold on!" &amp;c, but told the little story
                accidentally one <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03203.007_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.007_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                day.</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">But—its all in a life time. All sores heal now-a-days inside a week.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I mean to send some George Elliot plaques to Camden when I get them out—The
                original is done—&amp; waits only for duplicates.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Latchford likes the Whitman bust as represented in front of Horace's book. He laughed out—"Its more like Walt than anything
                I've ever seen."</p> 

            <p class="tei_p">Well, I am here yet in <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03203.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03203.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                the toils—trying to sing cheerily—"Blessed be poverty." I have many
                friends—more friends than money, &amp; I suppose that is as it should be. If
                they could not forever be taking me for a millionaire! Its awkward when your pennies
                are few to have it expected that thus you will easily enough spend time &amp;
                dollars for their good pleasure. I manage after a fashion to either conquer or
                disgust them.
