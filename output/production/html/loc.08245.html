                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1861–1934) was a writer and politician who served twice in the UK House
                    of Commons. Born in Australia to an Irish father and Scottish mother, Lynch was
                    educated at the University of Melbourne and worked as a civil engineer before
                    relocating to Galway, Ireland. During the Second Boer War, he raised an Irish
                    brigade that fought against the Crown; as a result, he was convicted of treason,
                    sentenced to death, and subsequently pardoned. Upon his release, Lynch attended
                    St. Mary's Hospital Medical School and became a general practitioner. Lynch
                    wrote prolifically in several genres, including fiction, poetry, and philosophy;

                    Downey, 1891). The book devotes much attention to Whitman, and Lynch writes that
                    Whitman "has the true poet's largeness of soul" but "lacks a little the singing
                    faculty, though the divine afflatus at his best carries him safely along" (41).
