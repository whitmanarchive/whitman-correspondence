                    mentioned receiving Schmidt's book in a letter to Whitman on <a href="loc.05143">October 11</a>. In this letter he summed up his
                    reactions to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> in a passage which Whitman
                    marked with red ink: "As to S. D. it is a suitable finish up to your work, it is
                    what we (those who know something of you) have been wanting for a long time and
                    what the future will want still more and will prize far more even than we can
                    prize it now—it is all on a low key (as it ought to be) no fine writing
                    but plain prose giving the <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_1 tei_gap_extent_word">[illegible]</span> just the
                    insight that we wanted into your common every day life, and your ordinary every
                    day manner of looking at things—I think you may now say that your work is
                    done, I do not see any more for you to do at all events though perhaps you will
                    see something, when you have had time to look about again a bit." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
