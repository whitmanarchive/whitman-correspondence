            <p class="tei_p">I have just rec'd your letter. To make the matter certain won't you take thirty or forty minutes &amp; go down to the St. Cloud—look at the rooms, &amp; pick out one for me?—positively engaging it—You know what is good as well as I do, (I mean for me)—I shall want a room at least for a few weeks—&amp; perhaps for the winter—&amp; for that season one is not so particular about the location—(But perhaps you have already engaged for me at St. C. a specific room.)</p>

                    reported that Whitman now supported the French, liked and defended Grant, and
