        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your good letter came all right—it is pretty much "the same subject continued"—with my health &amp; feelings—very grave depressions, alternated with more favorable spells—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">To-day, as I write, I am in good spirits &amp; comparatively comfortable—after a painful attack last night—So it goes—What will be the finale remains to be seen.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I await your further letters with some curiosity—(for strange as it may seem, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">men</span> have that weakness as well 
        as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">your sect</span>)—I have to-day dispatched dear Mrs. Johnson's 
        picture by mail—(It is intended to be put in a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">square gray or white mat with oval top</span>, 
        &amp; then in a plain black walnut rustic square frame, with thin strip of gilt inside, 
        &amp; good plate glass)—I shall look for Charles Eldridge—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">My sister is spending a few weeks at Atlantic City—I am <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span>, (declining several invitations) muchly but pleasantly, 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">alone</span>—We have a fine old Irish woman, (an old maid, not so very old either) who cooks nicely &amp; runs the domestic 
        machinery, for brothers George &amp; Eddy, &amp; self—She little knows how much good she does me with her great splendid 
        coarse face &amp; stout figure &amp; warm-blooded &amp; quaint &amp; simple &amp; affectionate ways—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Write soon, Nelly dear—</span>
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt.</span>
