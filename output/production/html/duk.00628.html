                    uncertain, but the most probable date is April 5, 1873. Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's letter acknowledges one from Walt Whitman, probably his <a href="tex.00338">April 4, 1873</a> letter, and Edwin Haviland Miller
                    dated this letter April 5?, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:208, n. 47; 2:370). Louisa responded to Walt that he "should certainly get a
                    place for you and edd and me": the word "certainly" echoes Walt's remark on
                    acquiring a house in Washington from his letter, that he "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">shall certainly do so</span>." Walt had also mentioned a house in his <a href="owu.00020">March 28, 1873</a> letter to Louisa. Louisa's statement
                    on the house is consistent also with the timing of George Washington Whitman's
                    new house on 431 Stevens Street: in this letter, she wrote that "george has
                    commenced his house the cellar is being dug." A week later she reported that
                    George's "house is begun the cellar dug and the foundation laid" (see her <a href="duk.00624">April 8, 1873</a> letter to Walt). Therefore, April 5,
                    1873 is the most probable date for this letter. However, Louisa also wrote, "i
                    told you saturday i would give you an account of our affairs," a statement that
                    cannot be reconciled with Louisa's <a href="duk.00617">March 29, 1873</a>
                    (Saturday) letter to Walt, which has no such promise. Despite that
                    inconsistency, Louisa's discussion of the prospective house that they could
                    share in Washington echoes Walt's April 4, 1873 letter, and her account of
                    George's progress on his new Camden house is in accord with her April 8 letter
                    to Walt. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_hyb.00002_n11 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="hyb.00002_n11"><span>Helen Price was the
                    daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
                    daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
                    movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
                    the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
                    1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's

                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
