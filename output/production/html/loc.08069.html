                also picts. Horace T resumes his old routine. 
                (He is bank clerk you know)—I heard this mn'g f'm Dr B[ucke] 
                Canada—Almost cool (sudden change) now f'm 
                the fearful unprecedented three days hot spell. It pull'd me down like a pack of hounds, 
                but I believe am emerging as before. 
                Am sitting here in the big chair by window—two dear little boys with their 
                delicious chatter just in to visit me—
