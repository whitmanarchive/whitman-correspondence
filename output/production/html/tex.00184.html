                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter of Wednesday evening last—I thought it would be very
                blustering &amp; cold there on the hill this winter, &amp; I know you must have
                freezing times, especially in the west rooms—We have had a great deal of snow
                here, &amp; very cold weather. I get along very well, considering.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I have to inform you that poor Mrs. Grayson has gone at last. I wrote in my last letter that I had met her son Willy
                in the street, Monday Jan. 7, &amp; he told me she was somewhat better—well,
                it was that very night, she died, &amp; was buried the next Wednesday—they
                sent me word that the funeral was to be at ½ past 2—but the man didn't
                tell me any thing about it till 4—so I was not at the funeral—poor
                woman, she is at rest, &amp; it is a blessed thing for her—she had an easy
                &amp; peaceful death, I hear—But that devil, old Grayson, it is he that was
                the cause of her dying—about three days before her death, he had a fight in
                the house, with his son-in-law—there was great excitement, &amp; Old Grayson
                put them all out of the house, son-in-law, children, &amp;c—I suppose that
                hastened Mrs. Grayson's death—I have not been there, but shall go &amp; see
                poor old Mrs. Mix—She will not last long now—Old Aunt Kitty, the washwoman, says
                that Mrs. Grayson spoke much about me, &amp; wanted me to come &amp; see
                her—but I never knew any thing of it—(Mother, I believe there can be a
                greater nuisance &amp; devil even than Heyde.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, we are having pretty serious times here, in Congress, &amp;c—I rather
                think they are going to impeach Johnson &amp; bring him to trial—it is a
                serious business—I cannot tell how it will turn out—only I know both
                sides seem determined, &amp; neither will give an inch—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There have been several died in the hospital, that I was with a good deal, since I
                last wrote—one of consumption—one of abscess on the liver, very
                bad—I was down there Sunday afternoon, carried a great big 12 pound cake, for
                the men's supper—there was a piece for all, &amp; very acceptable—as
                the supper consisted of plain bread, a thin wash they called tea, &amp; some
                miserable apple sauce—that was all—I carry a big cake often of Sunday
                afternoons—I have it made for me by an old mulatto woman, cook, that keeps a
                stand in the market—it is sort of molasses pound cake, common but good.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have received a letter from old Uncle Otis Parker, the old man that I got pardoned down at Cape Cod, Mass. He
                is very grateful.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Every thing in the office here goes on as usual. I have a little more work to do than
                I have had. One of the clerks, the youngest, was dismissed, (or suspended,) lately
                for selling some information about pardons to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>—the Attorney Gen'l was very mad about it, &amp; gave him a sharp
                talking to. We are having quite good sleighing here to-day.
                
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well good bye, dear mother—&amp; give my love to George, &amp; Jeff, &amp;
                Matty, &amp; all.</p>
