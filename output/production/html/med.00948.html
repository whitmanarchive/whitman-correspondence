                    (1852–1928) was the eldest son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. Hallam
                    was educated at Marlborough College and Trinity College, Cambridge. He served as
                    the personal secretary and biographer of his father, and he was made the
                    Governor of South Australia in 1899. Four years later, he began serving as the
                    second Governor-General of Australia, a position he held until 1904. He spent
                    the last years of his life in Farringford, serving as the deputy Governor of the
                    Isle of Wight from 1913. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00948_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00948_n1"><span>Tennyson sent this letter to

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                    birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
                    the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
                    (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
                    dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
                    addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
                    arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks and give a speech. The notes
                    and addresses, as well as Whitman's speech, were collected and edited by Horace
                    Traubel. The volume was titled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden's Compliment to Walt
                        Whitman</span>, and it included a photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of
                    Whitman as the frontispiece. The book was published in 1889 by Philadelphia
                    publisher David McKay. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
