                you.—No, that will never be.—I often recall your visits to me, and your
                goodness.—I think profoundly of my friends—though I cannot write to them

                me.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I spent an evening with Mr. Arnold<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">3</a> and Mrs. Price<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> lately.—Mrs. Price and Helen<a href="#n4167" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4167">5</a>

                great day's work—as much, one of the Beecher ladies said, as a sempstress
                could have got through with in six months.—Mrs. P and Helen had engagements
                for a fortnight ahead, to go out among families and take the sewing
                machine.—What a revolution this little piece of furniture is
                producing.—Isn't it quite an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">encouragement</span>.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I got into quite a talk with Mr. Arnold about Mrs. Hatch.<a href="#n1b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1b">7</a>—He says the pervading thought of her speeches is that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> exists the spirituality of any thing, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> gives existence to things, the earth, plants, animals, men,
                women.—But that Andrew Jackson Davis<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">8</a> puts <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">matter</span> as the subject of his homilies, and the primary
                source of all results—I suppose the soul among the rest.—Both are quite
                determined in their theories.—Perhaps when they know much more, both of them
                will be much less determined.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A minister, Rev. Mr. Porter,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">9</a> was introduced to me this
                morning,—a Dutch Reformed minister, and editor of the "Christian

                Grass," and wanted <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">more</span>?—He said he hoped I retained

                faith in all sects, and was not inclined to reject one single one—but believed
                each to be about as far advanced as it could be, considering what had preceded
                it—and moreover that every one was the needed representative of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">its</span> truth—or of something needed as much as
                truth.—I had quite a good hour with Mr. Porter—we grew friends—and
                I am to go dine with the head man of the head congregation of Dutch Presbyterians in
                Brooklyn, Eastern District!</p>

                willing to give up the plates—they want the thing off their hands.—In
                the forthcoming vol. I shall have, as I said, a hundred poems, and no other matter
                but poems—(no letters to or from Emerson—no notices, or any thing of
                that sort.)—I know well enough, that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> must be
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">true</span> Leaves of Grass—I think it (the new vol.)
                has an aspect of completeness, and makes its case clearer.—The old poems are
                all retained.—The difference is in the new character given to the mass, by the
                additions.—</p>

                promised visit.—How it is I know not, but I hang back more and more from

                    merchant and importer like his father. During the Civil War, he played a significant role at
                    the Battle of Antietam and rose to the rank of brigadier general in the Union

                    impression on Tyndale. Whitman wrote to his mother that Tyndale "has been to see me
                    again—always talks about you" (see Whitman's <a href="duk.00382">June 29,

                    Whitman frequently argued without "the slightest irritation between them"

                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of

                    (1811–1896) and Orson Squire Fowler (1809–1887) were brothers from
                    Cohocton, New York, and well-known phrenologists. They established a
                    Phrenological Cabinet in Clinton Hall in New York City in 1842, where Whitman
                    received a phrenological examination in 1849. The Fowlers' brother-in-law Samuel
                    R. Wells also joined the firm, which later came to be known as Fowler and Wells.
                    The firm published numerous books and magazines on phrenology, reform, and
                    self-help topics, and anonymously published Whitman's second edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1856. For more information, see
