                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Friend,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Do not suppose, because I have delayed writing to you, that I have forgotten
                you.—No, that will never be.—I often recall your visits to me, and your
                goodness.—I think profoundly of my friends—though I cannot write to them
                by the post office.—I write to them more to my satisfaction, through my
                poems.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tell Hector I thank him heartily for his invitation and
                letter—O it is not from any mind to slight him that I have not answered it, or
                accepted the friendly call.—I am so non–polite—so habitually
                wanting in my responses and ceremonies.—That is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span>—much that is bad, harsh, an undutiful person, a thriftless debtor, is
                me.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I spent an evening with Mr. Arnold and Mrs. Price lately.—Mrs. Price and Helen
                had been out all day with the sewing machine, at Mr. Beecher's—either Henry Ward's, or his father's. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fhun.00046.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fhun.00046.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fhun.00046.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> They had done a
                great day's work—as much, one of the Beecher ladies said, as a sempstress
                could have got through with in six months.—Mrs. P and Helen had engagements
                for a fortnight ahead, to go out among families and take the sewing
                machine.—What a revolution this little piece of furniture is
                producing.—Isn't it quite an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">encouragement</span>.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I got into quite a talk with Mr. Arnold about Mrs. Hatch.—He says the pervading thought of her speeches is that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> exists the spirituality of any thing, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> gives existence to things, the earth, plants, animals, men,
                women.—But that Andrew Jackson Davis puts <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">matter</span> as the subject of his homilies, and the primary
                source of all results—I suppose the soul among the rest.—Both are quite
                determined in their theories.—Perhaps when they know much more, both of them
                will be much less determined.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A minister, Rev. Mr. Porter, was introduced to me this
                morning,—a Dutch Reformed minister, and editor of the "Christian
                Intelligencer," N.Y.—Would you believe it—he had been reading "Leaves of
                Grass," and wanted <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">more</span>?—He said he hoped I retained
                the true Reformed faith which I must have inherited from my mother's Dutch
                ancestry.—I <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fhun.00046.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fhun.00046.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fhun.00046.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> not only assured him of my retaining faith in that sect, but that I had perfect
                faith in all sects, and was not inclined to reject one single one—but believed
                each to be about as far advanced as it could be, considering what had preceded
                it—and moreover that every one was the needed representative of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">its</span> truth—or of something needed as much as
                truth.—I had quite a good hour with Mr. Porter—we grew friends—and
                I am to go dine with the head man of the head congregation of Dutch Presbyterians in
                Brooklyn, Eastern District!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Mrs. Walton once or twice since you left
                Brooklyn,—I dined there.—I feel great sympathy with her, on some
                accounts.—Certainly, she is not happy.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Fowler &amp; Wells are bad persons for me.—They
                retard my book very much.—It is worse than ever.—I wish now to bring out
                a third edition—I have now <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a hundred</span> poems ready
                (the last edition had thirty–two.)—and shall endeavor to make an
                arrangement with some publisher here to take the plates <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fhun.00046.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fhun.00046.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fhun.00046.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> from F. &amp; W. and make the
                additions needed, and so bring out the third edition.—F. &amp; W. are very
                willing to give up the plates—they want the thing off their hands.—In
                the forthcoming vol. I shall have, as I said, a hundred poems, and no other matter
                but poems—(no letters to or from Emerson—no notices, or any thing of
                that sort.)—I know well enough, that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> must be
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">true</span> Leaves of Grass—I think it (the new vol.)
                has an aspect of completeness, and makes its case clearer.—The old poems are
                all retained.—The difference is in the new character given to the mass, by the
                additions.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, I do not feel like fixing a day on which I will come and make my
                promised visit.—How it is I know not, but I hang back more and more from
                making visits even to those I have much happiness in being with.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is well—all are well.—Mother often
                speaks about you.—We shall all of us remember you always with more affection
                than you perhaps suppose.—Before I come to Philadelphia, I shall send you or
                Hector a line.—</p>
