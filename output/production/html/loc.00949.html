               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Your letter was very welcome, and I have not forgotten you one day, though I have not written you. But I have been very much occupied in thought, as well as much of my time in going daily, &amp; some days twice to see Miss Howard. Her sister Sallie has the worst form of typhoid fever. She has been very ill for three weeks, &amp; alarmingly so for over ten days. Her mother <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00949.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00949.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00949.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>was sent for more than a week ago, and two doctors have come twice a day to see her for many days. I don't suppose there is any hope at all. She is wild with delirium all the time. Poor Garrie is worn, but she bears up like a hero under it, does not leave her sister night or day. I got a good nurse for them, as their nurse had to leave.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is very sad, &amp; I have not given up hoping till to-day, but she has no encouraging symptoms.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00949.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00949.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00949.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was so glad to hear that your little pet was better, and that your mother had got home! Has the little girl continued to improve? I hope so.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was good too, to hear that your mother was so well, &amp; George, &amp; all of you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are all well now. I trust the little girl is picking up fast.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You ask about William. His letters have been "few and far between", four in five weeks,— but now I look a little for him to-morrow, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00949.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00949.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00949.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>Saturday, and shall surely expect him on Sunday.  I guess he has had a good time, &amp; he sent the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">MSS.</span> to Curtis.  You may see him in New York to-morrow.  He will see Curtis, I suppose.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When you come back what <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lots</span> of things we shall have to talk about.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I saw in the Tribune of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Wednesday</span> the advertisement of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum Taps</span>.  Glad we were to see it, Charley &amp; I.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, will you see in New York Mr. Howells? I don't even know his address, &amp; it is necessary that I should write him a business letter. I wonder how they are. Give him my love if you see him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeannie is well, &amp; sends love. I am well, so is Charley, &amp; he too, sends love. We all want to see you back.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Ashton is well, but
<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very busy,</span>
&amp; looks worn. His wife is well, &amp; I guess they will come soon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to your mother, &amp; with much love to you - hoping soon to see you.</p>
