I got a good nurse for them, as their nurse had to leave.</p>

                    with William D. and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
                    to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>,
                    an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
                    O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
                    1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
                    Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
                    Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
                    correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
                    correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00949_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00949_n2"><span>Probably Garaphelia

                    letter to Ellen O'Connor, Whitman describes Garaphelia Howard as "a good, tender
