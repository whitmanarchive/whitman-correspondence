            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a check for ten dollars payable to your order—the money comes from
               Chaphe who wants you to send him copies of your various books so far as it will pay 
               for them—particularly he desires to get Dr Bucke's book—You will remember that you sent him a copy of the "Author's Edition" of Leaves of Grass—so I suppose that may be left out—If you express the books (which I suppose would be the best way) direct them to me and we will pay the express charges at this end.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is no particular hurry for this; you of course will leave it till you are feeling all right—and the hot weather has lifted a little. In depositing this check or getting the money for it you will just write your name on the back below mine</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well have had a terrible <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">seige​ </span><span class="tei_corr">siege​
        
      </span></span> of hot weather—yesterday—they say the heat was greater on the street level than it has been since 1838—it was 102 in the shade at my office</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We were all very glad to hear from you—the telegram came all right—as did the postal—I hope you are having cool weather now—and that you will have no more of the bad spells—We had a fine shower last night—and to-day it has dropped some 18 degrees—so that we are comparatively comfortable—I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> want another day like yesterday</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All send love—and sincerely hope you are all right. I am trying to arrange to get on and pay you a visit some time this fall—if I can make it, I want to do it—</p>
