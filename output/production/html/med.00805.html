                    Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
                    (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
                    and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
                    Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
                    advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and

                    George Stafford (1827–1892) were the parents of Whitman's young friend,
                    Harry Stafford. Whitman often visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek
                    in Laurel Springs (near Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by
                    Herbert Gilchrist; in the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby
                    Glendale. For more, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Ford sisters was enclosed in a (lost) letter from Edward Carpenter which Whitman
                    received on July 11 (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
                    William Sloane Kennedy noted on his transcription that Whitman wrote "on back of
                    O'Connor's last letter fr California, as he was setting out to return to
                    Washington." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
