               <span class="tei_salute">Dear son &amp; comrade,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote a few lines about five days ago &amp; sent on to Armory Square, but as I have not heard from it I suppose you have gone on to Michigan. I got your letter of Nov 10th, &amp; it gave me much comfort. Douglass, I shall return to Washington about the 24th, so when you write direct to care of Major Hapgood, paymaster U S A, Washington D. C.—Dearest comrade, I only write this, lest the one I wrote five days ago may not reach you from the hospital. I am still here at my mother's, &amp; feel as if [I] have had enough of going around New York—enough of amusements, suppers, drinking, &amp; what is called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pleasure</span>—Dearest son, it would be more pleasure if we could be together just in quiet, in some plain way of living, with some good employment &amp; reasonable income, where I could have you often with me, than all the dissipations &amp; amusements of this great city—O I hope things may work so that we can yet have each other's society—for I cannot bear the thought of being separated from you—I know I am a great fool about such things, but I tell you the truth, dear son. I do not think one night has passed in New York or Brooklyn when I have been at the theatre or opera or afterward to some supper party or carouse made by the young fellows for me, but what amid the play or the singing, I would perhaps suddenly think of you—&amp; the same at the gayest supper party, of men, where all was fun &amp; noise &amp; laughing &amp; drinking, of a dozen young men, &amp; I among them, I would see your face before me in my thought as I have seen it so often there in Ward G, &amp; my amusement or drink would be all turned to nothing, &amp; I would realize how happy it would be if I could leave all the fun &amp; noise &amp; the crowd &amp; be with you—I don't wish to disparage my dear friends &amp; acquaintances here, there are so many of them &amp; all so good, many so educated, traveled, &amp;c., some so handsome &amp; witty, some rich &amp;c., some among the literary class—many young men—all good—many of them educated &amp; polished, &amp; brilliant in conversation, &amp;c—&amp; I thought I valued their society &amp; friendship—&amp; I do, for it is worth valuing—But, Douglass, I will tell you the truth, you are so much closer to me than any of them that there is no comparison—there has never passed so much between them &amp; me as we have—besides there is something that takes down all artificial accomplishments, &amp; that is a manly &amp; loving soul—My dearest comrade, I am sitting here writing to you very late at night—I have been reading—it is indeed after 12, &amp; my mother &amp; all the rest have gone to bed two hours ago, &amp; I am here alone writing to you, &amp; I enjoy it too, although it is not much, yet I know it will please you, dear boy—If you get this, you must write &amp; tell me where &amp; how you are. I hope you are quite well, &amp; with your dear wife, for I know you have long wished to be with her, &amp; I wish you to give her my best respects &amp; love too.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Douglass, I haven't written any news, for there is nothing particular I have to write. Well, it is now past midnight, pretty well on to 1 o'clock, &amp; my sheet is most written out—so, my dear darling boy, I must bid you good night, or rather good morning &amp; I hope it may be God's will we shall yet be with each other—but I must indeed bid you good night, my dear loving comrade, &amp; the blessing of God on you by night &amp; day, my darling boy.
