                    of the Light Brigade," and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam A.H.H.</span>. In 1850,
                    the same year <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span> was published, Tennyson was
                    chosen as the new poet laureate of England, succeeding William Wordsworth. The

                    Tennyson wrote after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly
                    influenced Walt Whitman's poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman
