                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    Harry Stafford. Whitman often visited the family at their farm at Timber Creek
                    in Laurel Springs (near Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by
                    Herbert Gilchrist; in the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
