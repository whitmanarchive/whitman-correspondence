               <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother George</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I send you draft on New York no. 5104, for five hundred and ten dollars<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—the ten you will please give to Mother as a present from Mattie</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are getting along abt the same as usual. Mat still has a bad cough—yet I hardly think it as bad as it was a few weeks ago. I should'nt wonder if she and Jessie made you a visit in the course of a month or so<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>  The doctor told Mat yesterday that he thought a visit east would do her cough more good than anything else—and if that is the case I am anxious that she should go. Tell Mammy not to commence to worry about it yet though for perhaps she may not be afflicted.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How are you getting along with your new house<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—well I hope  Is there much building in B[rooklyn] this year—in St. Louis there are more houses going up this year than ever before—some 2500 dwelling houses are reported in process of construction.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What is the news about the water works office—I find every body there as tight as a bottle in the way of writing  I suppose they must take their cue from Mr Lane<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—I wish you would drop me a line telling me what news there is—did you go to Phillipsburgh<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—and if so what did you see</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see by the papers that you have had some pretty bad rain storms in Brooklyn—we have lately had two storms that has put us back on the work very much indeed—the contractors were not prepared for them and so were damaged a good deal  We have had a pretty severe storm this morning—but nothing like the others.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I understand you were down to Woods at Florence<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>  did you see our 36" pipe and if so what did you think of them—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Do you think you will continue to live in Atlantic street this winter—or do you think you will "move" as mother has been talking about for the last year or two—and by the way when do you expect Walt home—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How are political matters about Brooklyn—Seymour<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I suppose will be ahead just in and about New York City but will he carry the state do you think—The only thing that will save this state to Grant—if it is saved—will be the "iron clad oath"<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>  The rebs are, I judge, in the majority here—but they dont allow many of them to register and when they do do it they have to do some pretty tall swearing. I took the oath 'tother day—as I want to vote for Grant—all the other questions though I think I shall leave out<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>  Write me and tell me all the news in and about Brooklyn—Love to Mother and all—</p>

                    sugggested a change of air, Mattie went to Brooklyn with her two daughters on
                    October 14 and lived with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman until mid-December. Jeff
                    joined his family around November 20 (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1977], p. 60). Despite her poor health, Mattie did little to
                    ease the strain on her throat. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman informed Walt Whitman
                    on November 11 that the doctor had "performed two moderate operations on her
                    throat  but O dear if you could hear her talk  it would make me hoarse to talk a
                    steady stream as she does when any one comes in to see her" (Trent Collection of
                    Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections

                    constitution of 1865 required that all citizens take a stringent loyalty oath
                    before they could register to vote, thus effectively disfranchising many
                    ex-Confederates and their sympathizers. This controversial oath, one of the
                    strictest in the nation, was repealed in 1870. Despite Jeff's fears, Grant
                    carried Missiouri by a wide margin. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00450_n9 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00450_n9"><span>One of these
