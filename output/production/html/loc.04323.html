            <p class="tei_p"> Probably you have forgotten me by this time. In the long "times gone by" you may
                remember me with some other lads who used to sit in your room in Myrtle <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_if">ave</span> &amp;
                hear you tell stories &amp; help you drink coffee. There was Joe Heyer, Bill
                    Devoe, your brother Jeff, &amp;
                others. I remember well the first time I ever saw President Lincoln. You &amp; I
                stood talking on G St. (I think it was) near Secretary Chase's residence Washington.
                You said to me "There goes <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00068_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00068_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00068_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Uncle Abe, I shall never forget <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_quantity_1 tei_gap_unit_word">[cut away]</span> impression it made on me at the time. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I saw an article in the Sunday Eagle giving an account of an interview with you at
                your home in Camden which interested me very much. Joe Heyer loaned me the paper to
                read it &amp; by the by Joe works for us &amp; we often in speaking of old times,
                mention the days &amp; times we passed with our old friend Walt Whitman. I am
                collecting Photos of distinguished Americans &amp; would be glad to get one of
                yours, if it can be got. Joe has an Engraving of you which he prizes highly. If
                there is any published will you let me know. I suppose your time is occupied but I
                should dearly love to hear form you &amp; believe me to be</p>
