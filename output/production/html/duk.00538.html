                called "Little Mitch," was a Union soldier who served with the Michigan Cavalry during the 
                American Civil War. Farwell met Walt Whitman in Armory
                Square Hospital early in 1864; upon his release from the hospital he
                corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
                1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence
                was renewed when Whitman sent a post card (now lost) on February 5, 1875. In Farwell's last letter, on <a href="duk.00539">August 16,
                    1875</a>, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California.
                Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection, Duke University. He is
                mentioned in <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/memoranda.html"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During the War</span></a> (1875–1876). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n5005">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_xml:id_n5005 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n5005"><span>It is uncertain which letter is
