                <span class="tei_salute"/>Dear Mont</span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have come on here (about 500 miles further) &amp; am stopping in this city for a few
                days situated very comfortably &amp; feeling pretty well—the journey is doing
                me good, for I lay quite sick in London about three weeks. I am better, &amp;
                enjoying everything. I am traveling mostly by water,—and spent several days in
                "the Lakes of the Thousand Islands"—that is what they call a part of the St
                Lawrence river, some 50 miles long, &amp; 10 to 20 wide, filled with the prettiest
                islands you ever see, all sizes, some quite big with fine farms on them, &amp; some
                very moderate—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00261_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00261_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00261_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>others rocky hills like, of an acre or two covered with
                cedars—but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the water</span> every where I travel in this
                country is the best part,—it is more beautiful and bright than you can conceive,
                very clean &amp; pure, of a sky-blue color &amp; there seems no end of it—I
                travel for days &amp; days over it, from Lake Huron on through Lake Erie and Ontario
                &amp; down the St Lawrence to here (700 miles) &amp; it is just as fascinating to me
                now as ever—I have been in sight of it or traveling on it ever since I have been in
                Canada—I never get tired of it—(We have nothing like it our way, so
                grand &amp; bright &amp; clear.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—This is a large &amp; busy city, the most
                important in Canada, ships and steamboats &amp; immense numbers of
                emigrants—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00260_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00260_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00260_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>This is in general 
                quite a great farming country—the land not near so rich &amp; good as out west in the United States,—
                dont raise such corn &amp;c—but it is a healthy &amp; 
                beautiful country here, good climate—pretty good for wheat—they raise a good deal of barley here, 
                (perhaps more than any other grain)—but a fair show of wheat—first rate for grass—ditto for 
                apples—then there is so good a chance for a farmer to have his farm run down to the water—As I travel I see
                hundreds and hundreds of farms, seems to me a majority of them along the banks,—they set a little up, &amp;
                sprinkled with trees—looks as though the folks ought to be happy—(but I suppose they are just like all
                the rest of us)—It is very different from what I saw out in Kansas last fall—no water <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">there</span></p>

            <p class="tei_p">I often think of you all, I wish your father could be out here, &amp; travel through
                it once see the country &amp; the water &amp; farming &amp; everything—he
                would enjoy seeing it all, &amp; would understand many things about it better than I
                do—But <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> ought to take some such trip Mont boy,
                it would make you open your eyes—(Only I must say I like the smell of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">salt and sedge</span> along the water, it is what I was born to,
                like Long Island or Old Jersey—but it is all <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fresh</span>
                here)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I am going on some 400 miles further—north east to the river Saguenay, (you will see it on
                the map of Canada toward north east)—then back again to stay awhile in the old
                city of Quebec—give my love to your parents—tell your mother I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  her letter—love to Debby, I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  her letter too—love to Ed and Harry &amp; Jo and Van, and Ruthey
