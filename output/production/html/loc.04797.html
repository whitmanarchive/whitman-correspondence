                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For
                    more information, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    (1837–1901), a Canadian physician and psychiatrist, was the Head of the
                    Asylum for the Insane in Ontario, Canada, and a close friend of Whitman. In
                    1867, Bucke read Whitman's poetry for the first time and became a devoted
                    follower; he visited Whitman in Camden in 1877. Bucke became the poet's first
                    biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
                    1883) and was one of Whitman's literary executors after Whitman's death in 1892.
                    Bucke also provided a date (usually the year) for many of Hannah's letters to
                    Whitman. For more information, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice (1837–1901)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
