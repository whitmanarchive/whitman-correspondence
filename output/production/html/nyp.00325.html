                    Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
                    Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
                    and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
                    and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
                    William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
                    as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
                    relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r0450">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00325_n2 note" id="nyp.00325_n2"><span>Whitman refers here to his nephew, Walter

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"
