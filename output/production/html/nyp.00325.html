        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here alone in the front room—a cold, gusty, wintry day outside, but
        bright &amp; sunshiny—have just read your good letter of the 22d—Nothing special
        or different about my sickness or condition—I keep on much in the same
        way—gastric &amp; liver trouble pretty grave, &amp; (as a resultant) head distress
        more than half the time—go about though—The baby is
        getting along well—though there are better, &amp; fatter, &amp; handsomer babies, this
        one is fine enough for all practicable purposes, is well formed, &amp; has (I think) an
        especially fine pair of eyes—Knows me, &amp; seems to like to be tended to
        occasionally held by me—begins to laugh, &amp; [<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>] [not at] all nervous or
          scareable—[<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>] though (cant [<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>] altogether satis[factory] [<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>] [de?]formed one, has been [<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>] foot, but is now nearly [<span class="teispace">[no handwritten text supplied here]</span>] been steady—I have tended it—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My sister and brother <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="George​ ">Geo:</span>​  are well—My other sisters, nieces, &amp; brother Jeff, were well at last
        accounts. I am glad you wrote me about your mother. John Burroughs visited me some weeks since, on his way home from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash'n</span>​ . Miss Kate Hillard wrote me she is to be in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila.</span>​  on her way to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ "><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash'n</span>​ </span>​  26th to 29th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="February​ ">Feb.</span>​  in Clinton <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Street​ ">st.</span>​  near 10th, &amp; I am going over, 27th, to spend a couple of hours, as I know the
        folks. (Mrs. and Prof. and Miss Lesley.) As Hector Tyndale lives only two or three doors from there, I shall look in on him,
        or at least make some inquiry—&amp; will send you word. The N.Y. Tribune of last
        Saturday (19th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="February​ ">Feb.</span>​ ) had the 2½ column synopsis of my new book, pretty full &amp; fair—I suppose the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span> extracts you mention must have come from it—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">M. D. Conway has not yet gone back to London—goes on two
        or three weeks—How about Chas: Eldridge? Remembrance to Mrs. Brownell, Mrs. Huntington, Mrs. Johnson &amp; Miss Donaldson, &amp; best love to you, Nelly
        dear—</p>
