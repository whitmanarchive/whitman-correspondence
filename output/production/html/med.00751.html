            <p class="tei_p">I have been somewhat <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">down</span> for days, even weeks past, but am
                better now—have been out a little to-day, driven in the phaeton. Come over
                very soon &amp; see me. Nothing particular, but it will cheer me up. Bring anybody
                you like with you.</p>
