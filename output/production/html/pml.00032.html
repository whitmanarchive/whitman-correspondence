            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, New Year has begun—it is the funniest one yet—there is
                a fog as dark as Egypt here, sometimes you cant see a rod before you—it has
                been so for two days steady—very muddy, &amp; spells of drizzling rain—I
                am well &amp; hearty—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am just informed that I am to be transferred over to the Treasury Building, into
                the Solicitor of the Treasury's office (it is in the Department of Justice—is
                a branch of it)—Mr.
                Williams, the new boss, wishes to bring some
                friend of his here—I do not know that I shall dislike the change—I can
                tell better all about it in a week or two—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have applied for a good long leave of absence, to commence about Feb. 1st—I
                shall probably get it, but without pay, (or with only a small part pay)—I am
                willing to take a leave without pay—I want to come home for a while, both to
                be home, &amp; to see about the new edition of my books—I am real well &amp;
                fat &amp; hearty this winter—but I believe I have got a little set against one
                thing &amp; another here, (especially the grub,) &amp; I want a change for a couple
                of months very much—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I want to hear about your last week—&amp; George &amp; Lou—I
                sent three letters to you last week, &amp; papers—I knew that policeman
                Doyle that was shot dead here—he was Peter Doyle's
                brother—I was at the funeral yesterday—it was in the papers I sent
                you—love to you, dear mama—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I forgot to say Arthur Price is here, on the iron-clad <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mahopac</span>—the vessel is at the navy-yard—expects to sail
                    soon—I am going down this afternoon to go on board the ship &amp; see
                    him—he is well &amp; hearty.</p>
