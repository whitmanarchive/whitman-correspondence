            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, New Year has begun—it is the funniest one yet—there is
                a fog as dark as Egypt here, sometimes you cant see a rod before you—it has
                been so for two days steady—very muddy, &amp; spells of drizzling rain—I
                am well &amp; hearty—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am just informed that I am to be transferred over to the Treasury Building, into
                the Solicitor of the Treasury's office (it is in the Department of Justice—is
                a branch of it)<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—Mr.
                Williams,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> the new boss, wishes to bring some
                friend of his here—I do not know that I shall dislike the change—I can
                tell better all about it in a week or two—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have applied for a good long leave of absence, to commence about Feb. 1st—I
                shall probably get it, but without pay, (or with only a small part pay)—I am
                willing to take a leave without pay—I want to come home for a while, both to
                be home, &amp; to see about the new edition of my books—I am real well &amp;
                fat &amp; hearty this winter—but I believe I have got a little set against one
                thing &amp; another here, (especially the grub,) &amp; I want a change for a couple
                of months very much—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I want to hear about your last week—&amp; George &amp; Lou—I
                sent three letters to you last week, &amp; papers—I knew that policeman
                Doyle<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> that was shot dead here—he was Peter Doyle's
                brother—I was at the funeral yesterday—it was in the papers I sent
                you—love to you, dear mama—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I forgot to say Arthur Price<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> is here, on the iron-clad <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mahopac</span>—the vessel is at the navy-yard—expects to sail
                    soon—I am going down this afternoon to go on board the ship &amp; see
                    him—he is well &amp; hearty.</p>

                    Velsor Whitman, saying, "I like this place just as well as the other" but
                    bemoaning the overcrowded nature of the office. The official transfer was not
                    prepared until March 10, 1873 (National Archives). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00032_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="pml.00032_n2"><span>George Henry Williams
                    (1820–1910), U.S. Senator from Oregon, served as Attorney General from
                    1871 to 1875. Williams dismissed Walt Whitman on June 30, 1874; Whitman
                    "respectfully acknowledged" his dismissal in his <a href="nar.00006">July 1,

                    murdered on December 29, 1871, by Maria Shea, known as "Queen of Louse Alley,"
                    when he went to her home to recover a stolen watch and chain. According to the
                    Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Morning Chronicle</span>, Doyle, a native of
                    Ireland, was 38, had a wife and three children, and lived at 340 K Street. He
                    had been on the police force for four or five years, and had served during the
                    War for three years as a fireman on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">U.S. Wabash</span>.
                    Among the manuscripts at Yale is a draft of an article which Whitman prepared
                    for a Washington newspaper to answer criticisms of Doyle for his "arrest of a
                    little boy, for theft." Whitman doubted that "the true interests" of the public
                    were "aided by this attempt to make martyrs and heroes of the steadily
                    increasing swarms of juvenile thieves &amp; vagabonds who infest the streets of
                    Washington." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00032_n4 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="pml.00032_n4"><span>Whitman refers to Abby
