The trouble has been as before, bad spells of weakness with heavy aching head—I think the throat is no worse, but it is not well yet—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William, I rec'd your letter to-day, also one from Charles Eldridge, with one in envelope—as to the future, &amp; as to our meeting again, I have no doubt we shall meet again &amp; have good times<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—if Nelly has not gone when this reaches you, I wish her to consider it just the same as if written to her—I do not write much, nor do any thing hardly, but keep as quiet as possible—my physician thinks that time, with the change of locality, &amp; my own latent recuperative power, will make me well, but says my system is probably saturated with the virus of the hospitals &amp;c which eludes ordinary treatment—&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have nothing new or interesting to write you. I intend to move heaven &amp; earth to publish my "Drum-Taps" as soon as I am able to go around.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">So Eldridge is down at Petersburgh<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—if I were there at Washington &amp; well I should want no better fun than accompanying them—When you see Count<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> tell him I sent him my love—also Ashton—I will write should there be any change in my condition—</p>

                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
                    Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
                    intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
                    clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
                    however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
                    on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman wrote on <a href="loc.00415">June 13, 1863</a>: "I am
                    real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
                    in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
                    twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
                    there are still people of that kind left."In his letter of <a href="med.00323">July 2, 1864</a>, O'Connor was deeply moved by
                    Whitman's departure from Washington: "Many thoughts of you have come to me since
                    you went away, and sometimes it has been lonely and a little like death.
                    Particularly at evening when you used to come in . . . I wonder what the future
                    for us is to be. Shall we triumph over obscurities and obstacles and emerge to
                    start the Pathfinder, or whatever the name of it is to be? . . . Or shall we
                    never meet, never work together, never start any Pathfinder, never do anything
                    but fade out into death, frustrated, lost in oblivion? . . . I hardly believe
                    you will come back here. But I hope you
                    will." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00189_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00189_n3"><span>According to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor's letter of <a href="loc.00943">July 5, 1864</a>, Eldridge had
                    gone to pay the staff officers of the Fifth Corps. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00189_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00189_n4"><span>Count Adam Gurowski
                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
                    (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
                    partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
                    covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
                    powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York, Rowman
                    and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
                    translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
                    O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Walt Whitman, on <a href="med.00324">August 13, 1864</a>, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he
                    had attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
                    pistol."
                    Walt Whitman maintained to Traubel, in 1888, that "he was truly a remarkable,
                    almost phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very
                    sane" (3:79, 340). O'Connor related in a letter on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
                    I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
                    trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
                    Diary, Gurowski placed Walt Whitman's name in the first category of his
                    threefold evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and
                    Half," and "Blame." The Count referred in his entry for April 18, 1864, to Walt
                    Whitman as among "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds"
                    (187). In a footnote (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski
                    abused Harlan, who had "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of
                    narrow-minded persecution that would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman
                    inquisitor." Gurowski was praised by Robert Penn Warren, in Malcolm Cowley, ed.,

O'Connor asked Whitman what
                    she should do with "Mrs. Beach's notes." Mrs. Juliette H. Beach was one of those
                    enigmatic women associated with Whitman about whom imaginative biographers have
                    spun ingenious theories. Mrs. Beach was to have reviewed the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday
                        Press</span>, but when her husband's unfavorable review was published instead,
                    the journal had to take public note of matrimonial discord in order to correct
                    the error (Gay Wilson Allen, The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt
                    Whitman [New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967],
                    260–262). Mrs. O'Connor contributed her bit to the theory that Mrs. Beach
                    and Whitman had a love affair when she asserted that "Out of the Rolling Ocean,
                    the Crowd," published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, was composed for "a
                    certain lady" who had angered her husband because of her correspondence with the
                    poet (Emory Holloway, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of
                        Walt Whitman</span> [Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921], 1:lviii).
                    "Mrs. Beach's notes" may be the letters to Whitman, which later Burroughs vainly
                    asked Mrs. Beach to print; see Clara Barrus, Whitman and
                    Burroughs—Comrades (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life and Letters of John Burroughs</span> (Boston: Houghton
                    Mifflin Co., 1925), 1:120. If these were love letters, Whitman hardly treated
                    Mrs. Beach's heart-stirrings discreetly. See also Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
