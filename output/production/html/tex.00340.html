                    Louisa's letter. Because Louisa was generally prompt about forwarding letters to
                    Walt Whitman, this letter dates to between November 11 and November 14,

                    a French-born landscape painter. The reason that Hannah's letter is "strangely

                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
