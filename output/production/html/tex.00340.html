            <p class="tei_p">i
                dont want to worry
                you but i thought i would send you
                hanna s
                letter it is rather a strangely
                connected letter
                
                but god only knows
                what will be the end of her troubles
                i have got one from him one of his
                ranting ones
                i cant tell what an awful
                letter it is) i wish she could be got here
                if matty and jeff
                does go back she could
                take that room till spring) The erysiplus
                generally affects the head so i think probably
                she will be quite smart) as she gets strenght
                doo you think she gets your letters walter
                perhaps she does i was thinking maybee
                it would be as well to send her one
                to the care of Dr. Thayer
                as i suppose he
                has a box at the post office but doo
                as you think best walter dear)
                i am pretty well matty is about as usual
                Jeffy will come in a few weeks</p>
            <p class="tei_p">dontbe worried no more than you can help walter
                i know the nature of the disease george
                would get
                something in his head and worry as she does about
                the letter if heyd was kind to her she would get well</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i wish you had went there walter when you was home</p>
