                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
                    published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

                    doctor, owes to you entirely his spiritual enfranchisement and deliverance from
                    soul-be-numbing scepticism, into which—not without pain—he had
                    gradually fallen. Your books are his constant companions, his spiritual
