            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I found your letter and Mrs Gilchrists and Mr Carpenters on my return, and we were
                much alarmed at first by reports, that you were very sick, but <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">yesterdays​ </span><span class="tei_corr">yesterday's​

                hope by this time you are on the mend, and will be able to make your trip. I have
                had such a delightful time, no

                trip, every thing passed along pleasantly. It seems to me that if one were to travel
                the world over one could not find anything to compare with the Falls. Watkins Glen
                is wonderful too, we were fortunate in Hotels, and every thing, I brought home some views of the Glen and Falls. Aunt Libbie is here
                still. Geo is well, in fact I never saw him look better, busy as ever, no time to
                ride much. Mrs Berry and family, have gone to

Mrs
                Wetherbee is away in Boston, <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_quantity_3 tei_unclear_unit_words tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_crl">Wht Marian Pains</span>, so our place is quiet. Mrs
                Wilson's infant is getting well. When I came home and found that the report was that
                you were very sick, I said that if I had known that, I would have gone to Canada,
                but the next day it was put in a milder way. I saw Mr Scovel in a street car the
                other day, I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">beleive​ </span><span class="tei_corr">believe​
        
      </span></span> there is nothing else new. I can hardly tell about my trip, but when you
                return, it will be as well, and you have passed over so much of the same country.</p>
