                    Whitman to Ernest Rhys of <a href="bms.00001">October 13, 1886</a>. Walt
                    Whitman had sent the copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> on February 2
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On <a href="pml.00086">February 15</a> Rhys wrote: "I must not decide off-hand
                    about the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>,—that is, whether to make
                    two vols. as you suggest, or to try &amp; get the whole into one. In the latter
                    case, the book would be rather crowded. . . No! I would not think of putting the
                    copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> with your corrections into the
                    printers' hands and will get copies from Wilson of Glasgow, carefully following
                    all your deletions &amp; so on. It is one of the greatest prizes I possess,
                    &amp; someday a sense of its value will inspire me, I'm afraid, to beg you to
                    send me a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> too with your name in
                    it, (&amp; mine, as proof of ownership,) &amp; some further inscription as
                    well." On <a href="loc.03316">January 19</a> Rhys wrote at length about a
                    kind of epiphany which he had experienced at the seashore; Walt Whitman termed
                    it "a wonderful letter." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
