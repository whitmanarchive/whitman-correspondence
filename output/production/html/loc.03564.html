                Rivulets," and "Democratic Vistas" since the books came, and am impelled to say to
                you that I rejoice greatly that my country has given birth to one who has placed on
                record so grand a presentation of her case!
            Entering upon the New Year, let me then, my dear Walt Whitman, send you warm greeting
                from the Tropic world, and wish you all things good and happy! I too have ventured a
                little upon verse, (of which I will send you an unbound copy, having at present none
                other) and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hope</span> I am a "live American." The prose 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> of
