                    (1819–97) graduated from Harvard in 1838 and soon became a leading civil
                    and hydraulic engineer. He designed and built many dams and mills in New
                    England, some of which still operate. Originally from Massachusetts, he settled
                    in New York in 1849 and served as sanitary engineer of the Metropolitan Board of
                    Health of New York City, 1866–69. He became noted for designing and
                    testing pumping engines, including some for James P. Kirkwood during the early
                    stages of the new St. Louis Water Works, and developed a major reputation as a
                    consultant. He published several books on engineering and served as president of
                    the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1887. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00443_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00443_n2"><span>Jeff probably wanted to

                    (1823–82) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917) took a degree in
                    civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856 and then helped
                    build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He was a topographical engineer in
                    Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend
                    of Jeff's, he became city engineer of Boston (1871–80) and completed his
                    distinguished career as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph
                    Company (1880–1908). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00443_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00443_n4"><span>Probably either John or
