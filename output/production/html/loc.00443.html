            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Sent letter to Worthen—as soon as received  Mother received letter and book—by the way can I get one of the books to present to Ruggles  The $31 was made up as follows  Moses Lane $5.  Davis $5.  self $5.  McNamee, Brower, Story, Bergen, Ward, Lewis, Clapp and Van Buren (all young men employed in our office) each $2. Hope you wont be disappointed in the smallness of the amount—but Davis had to go away and did'nt have time to see if he could collect any at his office.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother Mat and the children are all quite well—but have rather a hard time to keep warm—wish when you write Mother you would always say something abt Hattie's learning to read and play &amp;c  it sets her ahead wonderfully—you know how such things please children—should like to have you write me that long letter—I hope also to be able to pay you a short visit this winter—soon after the Holidays—everything is going abt as usual with us at home</p>
