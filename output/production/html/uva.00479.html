                    (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's
                        Monthly</span> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Century</span>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
                    Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
                    Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
                    one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
                    delirium" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
