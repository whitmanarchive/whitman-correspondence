                    née Pearsons, was a socialite and active member of various reform movements
                    and women's clubs. She served as the President of the Home Club of East Boston
                    and was a member of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union. She married
                    Ebenezer Spaulding, an Assistant Surgeon during the Civil War, and, later, a
                    homeopathic physician and surgeon who practiced in Boston. Ada Spaulding read
                    and admired Whitman's poetry, visited the poet, and wrote a number of letters to
                    him in his final years. For more on Spaulding, see Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="https://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol9/iss3/4/">Women's Letters to Walt
