            <p class="tei_p">The picture arrived this morning—it is a splendid piece of work &amp; I feel
                sure a good likeness—At any rate it is that rare bird a perfect photo—&amp; I am mighty glad to get it—it leans against the wall before me
                this moment with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the Bacon</span>—(I am ashamed to say never
                before acknowledged—but it is in my little sitting room &amp; before my eyes
                every day—more than half the time is taken for Shakspere)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am about as well as usual in general health—full as well—but laid by
                with lameness—added to by a fall two months ago &amp; turning my ankle in. I
                hear from Dr Bucke and John Burroughs—both well—Doctor busy as a
                bee—both vehement in hospitable invitations to me which I should be most glad
                to accept—but I find it best not to stray too far from my own chair &amp;
                    bed—Mrs Gilchrist has a strong article abt L.
                of G. &amp;c printed in the "To-day," cheap radical English magazine for
                June—I shall probably have some soon &amp; will send you one—It is equal
                to the 1872 piece—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How are you? Any prospect of decapitation? How is Nelly?
                Give my best love &amp; remembrances to her? I am comfortable here in my shanty. I
                suppose you get the papers &amp; pieces I send—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">So long</span>, dear friend—</p>
