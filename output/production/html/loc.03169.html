            <p class="tei_p">Every emendation of yrs is good. I rather doubted at first yr sub-head. But I guess
                it's better than mine, (wh' was too big-headed for the main structure). Your other
                touches give accuracy to my over-statements. Really I was unfit to treat
                    subject Howsomever, we've <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">together</span> hammered out a bit of wrought-iron work of some value. I never
                said anything just like it for fact-iness. The thing grew upon both of us, as we
                went on. Somebody ought to write a scholarly-picturesque thorough &amp; exhaustive
                history of the Dutch-Americans. I wish I were rich enough. I wd. go to Albany &amp;
                the pastoral horse-raising regions of New York State, &amp; to N.Y. City &amp; L.
                Island, &amp; study the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Dutch</span> people at first hand. I
                remember years ago I had a splendid <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">clean</span> young Dutch
                commercial fellow as a pupil in Brooklyn, N.Y. I taught him English through the
                medium chiefly of German.</p>

                    like that of an old Scotchman I heard of who was opposed to having water closets
                    in the middle of a house.</p>
