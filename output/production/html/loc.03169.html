                it's better than mine, (wh' was too big-headed for the main structure). Your other
                touches give accuracy to my over-statements. Really I was unfit to treat
                    subject<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Howsomever, we've <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">together</span> hammered out a bit of wrought-iron work of some value. I never
                said anything just like it for fact-iness. The thing grew upon both of us, as we
                went on. Somebody ought to write a scholarly-picturesque thorough &amp; exhaustive
                history of the Dutch-Americans. I wish I were rich enough. I wd. go to Albany &amp;
                the pastoral horse-raising regions of New York State, &amp; to N.Y. City &amp; L.
                Island, &amp; study the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Dutch</span> people at first hand. I
                remember years ago I had a splendid <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">clean</span> young Dutch
                commercial fellow as a pupil in Brooklyn, N.Y. I taught him English through the
                medium chiefly of German.</p>

                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
