            <p class="tei_p">A bad spell again—Wednesday was the worst—the light indeed was faintly
                fluctuating several times—but here I am yet—poor enough now but less <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">non</span>-myself—Osler<a href="#n4302" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4302">2</a> was here last
                evening—He does not apparently think any thing serious—at least nothing
                new—nothing but we knew before—The worst is this inveterate horrible
                costiveness—then the water works give me great annoyance &amp;
                trouble—my strength, equilibrium, power to stand up of my own volition &amp;
                mastery are quite gone—Ed<a href="#n4319" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4319">3</a> is very good—I gave him
                your little message<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a>—he has just helped me to the
                closet, where I tried an injection of soaped warm water but no result at
                all—One thing is I have not eaten any thing for three days—to day three
                or four mouthfuls &amp; a cup of coffee for breakfast—At present moment I am
                sitting in the big chair at the stove alone writing—weather cloudy
                half-&amp;-half—not cold—</p>

                covered in paper &amp; I will send you one, (perhaps two or three) at once—as
                there is some delay ab't the permanent binding—Yes I shall be hard to suit
                with the binding of the b[ig] b[ook]—As I finish the sun bursts out as if it
                meant to stay awhile strong &amp; clear—I am going to stretch out on the bed

                sleepless—up forty to fifty times—water-works irritation,
                scalding—I have been lying on the bed most of the time, but am now sitting
                here by the stove—declining light—rather pleasant weather—not

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,
