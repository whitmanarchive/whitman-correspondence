            <p class="tei_p">A bad spell again—Wednesday was the worst—the light indeed was faintly
                fluctuating several times—but here I am yet—poor enough now but less <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">non</span>-myself—Osler was here last
                evening—He does not apparently think any thing serious—at least nothing
                new—nothing but we knew before—The worst is this inveterate horrible
                costiveness—then the water works give me great annoyance &amp;
                trouble—my strength, equilibrium, power to stand up of my own volition &amp;
                mastery are quite gone—Ed is very good—I gave him
                your little message—he has just helped me to the
                closet, where I tried an injection of soaped warm water but no result at
                all—One thing is I have not eaten any thing for three days—to day three
                or four mouthfuls &amp; a cup of coffee for breakfast—At present moment I am
                sitting in the big chair at the stove alone writing—weather cloudy
                half-&amp;-half—not cold—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your good letter came this morning—I am having some copies of the big book
                covered in paper &amp; I will send you one, (perhaps two or three) at once—as
                there is some delay ab't the permanent binding—Yes I shall be hard to suit
                with the binding of the b[ig] b[ook]—As I finish the sun bursts out as if it
                meant to stay awhile strong &amp; clear—I am going to stretch out on the bed
                (rest, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tide over</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lay fallow</span>, &amp;
                such—are probably my best remedies to meet these spells)—</p>

                sleepless—up forty to fifty times—water-works irritation,
                scalding—I have been lying on the bed most of the time, but am now sitting
                here by the stove—declining light—rather pleasant weather—not
                cold—no word of O'C[onnor]—</p>
