               <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed $25 is from Joseph P. Davis<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> making with the $25 sent you last Tuesday $50 from Jo. Now I will give you a statement of the whole affair  Last Monday I received a letter from W. S. Davis,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Jo's brother [at?] Worcester, Mass. saying that he had received a letter from Joe directing him to send me $70. $50 to be sent to you and $20 to be expended in buying a present for young "Joe Probasco."<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> The $25 I sent you on Tuesday I borrowed of Mr Lane<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> so that I might send it immediately and to day I received a check for the $70. I have paid Mr Lane the $25 and according to Jo's direction send you the remaind[er] of the $50.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jo's brother, W. S. Davis, is a lawer, in Worcester,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> with a large number of acquaintances and I think liberal. I wrote him a note acknowledging the recipt of the money and telling him that you would write him a long letter,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> detailing the manner, style, &amp;c &amp;c of your dispensing the money (like those you used to write us)  ask him to show it to his friends and get them to give what they can and have him send it to you  He writes me that he wants you to acknowledge the receipt of the money, and also that he would much like to hear from you. I consider it an opportunity for you to make this $50 the father of 100's without in the least seeming like one asking for it</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I certainly think Mother is following a mistaken notion of ecomony.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I think the only decent meals that any of them have had for three months is what they have eaten with Mat and I. As regards Mother I am perfectly willing she should live with us all [the time?] (that is to eat, I mean) but Ed and Jess I cant stand entirely. Dont understand me that they do eat with us, for they dont as much perhaps as they used to. Mother certainly does not, not as much as we wish her to, for we always call her. I notice however that when Jess does eat with us that he does not throw up his victuals. And Andrew too, his trouble comes as much from his mode of living and sleeping  His room for sleeping is without ventilation. the window is coverd with posiness tress. He has no nice little things, [or] all nourishment fixed for him to eat, such as I intended Mat should fix for him. I dont think myself that we have any thing to do with Nancy, she is able enough to make a good living both for herself and the children, if she wasnt so dam'd lazy.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt I wish you was home for awhile. I think you would see and think as I do. I have scribbled this to you just as I have thought for a day or two. Ruggles<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> says that Andrew cannot be a well man in this town, to be sure even going away may not help him, but he thinks and is almost certain that it will. I wish if you dont come on you would write me also write Andrew. Oh you dont know how down spirited he is</p>

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend of Jeff Whitman's, he became city engineer of
                    Boston (1871–80) and completed his distinguished career as chief engineer
                    of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). For his work
                    with Jeff in St. Louis, see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's letters to Walt Whitman

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27,
                        1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in
                    the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman
                    wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of
                    money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
                    (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
                    Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00423_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00423_n5"><span>Someone, probably Walt

                    in the Whitman household at this time. Jeff thought that his mother's frugality
                    was endangering the health of his brothers; the mother felt that Jeff and Mattie
                    had themselves been stingy regarding Andrew. On September 15 (?), 1863, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman complained in a letter to Walt that Andrew and his wife Nancy
                    expected her to pay their rent: "i suppose martha has told nancy i have got 2 or
                    3 hundred dollars in the bank  they never gave him one cents worth when he went
                    away not even a shirt....i said to mat the other day in a joke if they had
                    another young one they would be so stingey we wouldent know what to doo but i
                    got the same old retort that it was me that was stingey with my bank book....i
                    told her the other day becaus i had 2 or 3 hu dolla if i used it all i might go

                    Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
                    especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
                    practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
