      <p class="tei_p">Your letter is rec'd, having been sent on to me from Washington.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> My address
        still remains Solicitor's office, Treasury there. I am moving about a good deal the past
        year, &amp; shall be for the ensuing year—I am to start for northern New England,
        &amp; remain awhile<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—am also arranging for a trip afterward
        to California—a journey I have had in contemplation for several years, &amp; which has
        been two or three times fixed, but postponed, during that time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been stopping for two months, (Feb. &amp; March,) home with my Mother<a href="#n0705" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0705">4</a>, &amp; am
        writing this home. Mother is towards eighty—has had an active domestic &amp; maternal
        life—has had eight children—has brought them all up—has been healthy &amp;
        strong, always worked hard—now shows the infirmities of age (indeed rapidly advancing)
        but looks finely, &amp; is cheerful hearted—will probably soon give up her
        housekeeping &amp; go to live with one of my brothers, who is married<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a>—My father died seventeen years since.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, I am quite sure that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">every one</span> of your letters has
        safely reached me—sometimes after delays &amp; circuits, (as you will now understand
        better) on account of my more &amp; more frequent
        wanderings—The
        letter with the photographs gave me great pleasure—&amp; was acknowledged by a letter
        I sent you<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a>—Have you not received it?</p>

        <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, let me warn you somewhat about myself—&amp; yourself also. You must
          not construct such an unauthorized &amp; imaginary ideal Figure, &amp; call it W. W. and
          so devotedly invest your loving nature in it. The actual W. W. is a very plain personage,
          &amp; entirely unworthy such devotion.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">7</a></p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                        1872</a>, Gilchrist objected to this warning: "it hurts so, as seeming to
                    distrust my love. . . . O, I could not live if I did not believe that sooner or
                    later you will not be able to help stretching out your arms towards me &amp;
                    saying 'Come, my Darling.'" On <a href="loc.02862">June 3, 1872</a>,
                    Gilchrist begged for a longer letter, "for I sorely need it." Though she
                    declared that she would be satisfied with a gossipy letter about his affairs,
                    she really wanted more: "And if you say 'Read my books, &amp; be
                    content—you have me in them'—I say, it is because I read them so
                    that I am not content." Toward the conclusion of the letter she spoke of coming
                    to America. On <a href="loc.02867">July 14, 1872</a>, she acknowledged his
                    gift of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free</span> and wrote again
                    of the effect of Whitman's poems on her: "Had I died the following year 1870, it
                    would have been the simple truth to say I died of joy." Gilchrist wrote again on
                        <a href="loc.02868">November 12, 1872</a>—Walt Whitman had been
                    silent—"I must write not because I have anything to tell you—but
                    because I want so, by help of a few loving words, to come into your presence as
                    it were—into your remembrance." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
