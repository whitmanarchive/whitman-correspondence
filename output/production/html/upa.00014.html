        <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter is rec'd, having been sent on to me from Washington. My address
        still remains Solicitor's office, Treasury there. I am moving about a good deal the past
        year, &amp; shall be for the ensuing year—I am to start for northern New England,
        &amp; remain awhile—am also arranging for a trip afterward
        to California—a journey I have had in contemplation for several years, &amp; which has
        been two or three times fixed, but postponed, during that time.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been stopping for two months, (Feb. &amp; March,) home with my Mother, &amp; am
        writing this home. Mother is towards eighty—has had an active domestic &amp; maternal
        life—has had eight children—has brought them all up—has been healthy &amp;
        strong, always worked hard—now shows the infirmities of age (indeed rapidly advancing)
        but looks finely, &amp; is cheerful hearted—will probably soon give up her
        housekeeping &amp; go to live with one of my brothers, who is married—My father died seventeen years since.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, I am quite sure that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">every one</span> of your letters has
        safely reached me—sometimes after delays &amp; circuits, (as you will now understand
        better) on account of my more &amp; more frequent
        wanderings—The
        letter with the photographs gave me great pleasure—&amp; was acknowledged by a letter
        I sent you—Have you not received it?</p>

        <p class="tei_p">Dear friend, let me warn you somewhat about myself—&amp; yourself also. You must
          not construct such an unauthorized &amp; imaginary ideal Figure, &amp; call it W. W. and
          so devotedly invest your loving nature in it. The actual W. W. is a very plain personage,
          &amp; entirely unworthy such devotion.</p>
