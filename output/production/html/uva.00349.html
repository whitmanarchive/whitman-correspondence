            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got Jeff's letter sending the money toward the soldiers' dinner—it was more than I asked for, &amp; was very good of them all<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I have not had any trouble myself, worth mentioning—the dinner has been got up at my instigation—I have contributed handsomely—but they, (the Hospital steward, &amp;c.) have done the work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I sent Han a handsome little volume of "Florence Percy's Poems,"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; $5 for a Christmas present. Sent it to-day. Poor Han—I suppose every such thing does her so much good—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Don't you believe that fool Heyde lately wrote a long letter to Mr. Raymond,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> editor of the N. Y. Times—in it he said "Walt was a good fellow <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">enough</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but</span>"—&amp; then he went on to run down Leaves of Grass, like the rest of 'em—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The way I know is, Wm. O'Connor was invited by Raymond to come &amp; see him—&amp; he told O'Connor he had received a number of letters about that piece in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> of Dec. 2, which I sent you. He said they all praised the piece, &amp; thanked him (Raymond) for printing it, except one he got from a fellow in Vermont who called himself Walt Whitman's relation—a brother in law, he believed—quite a good deal of stuff. Raymond seemed to think the man was either crazy or a fool, &amp; he treated the letter with contempt.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I dont want you to write any thing about it, to Han, of course—only if she was here, we would tell her. The puppy thought I suppose that he could get his letter printed, &amp; injure me &amp; my book.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are likely to have a pleasant day for Christmas—when I next write I will tell you about the dinner—I must inform you that I have had a present of a beautiful knife, a real Rogers' steel, to-day from the Attorney General—Mother, $2 is for Nance<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—you can give it to her in money, or any way you like—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, dear mother, this is Christmas eve, &amp; I am writing it in the office by gas light, so as it will be ready to go to-morrow—I have not heard since from Mrs. Grayson. Good night, mother dear.</p>

                    from employees at the Water Works: "Hope you wont be disappointed in the
                    smallness of the amount." Evidently Walt Whitman had also written to William E.
                    Worthen for funds (see Whitman's letter to his brother Jeff of <a href="loc.00829">May 23, 1864</a>

                    noted that he had "sent letter to Worthen." See also Whitman's letter of <a href="loc.00846">December 29,
