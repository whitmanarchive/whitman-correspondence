            <p class="tei_p">Pleasant weather—partial depression to-day—just finish'd my
                supper—some stew'd cherries, Graham bread, tea &amp; very small bit of broil'd
                meat—rec'd y'r letter—then you are going off on the Britannic on the
                8th—no doubt you will have a good trip—("hold your horses")—will prepare &amp; send you forthwith the
                introductory note to Tennyson (you can use it or not as
                convenient)—forthcoming L[ippincott's] mag not out
                yet, but I suppose it is all right—Dr L[ongaker]
                here yesterday—he aids the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">coleur de rose</span> view, (as a
                doctor doubtless should)—H T[raubel] is well—will
                write again Saturday, if not before. </p>
