                    5, 1871. The executors did not date this letter, and Edwin Haviland Miller did
                    not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:369). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "Oct 5," and based on her
                    statements that she had visitors and that she planned to make a long-delayed
                    trip to the post office tomorrow, the letter dates to 1871. A week earlier,
                    Louisa had noted her irritation at the arrival of her daughter Mary Van Nostrand
                    and family with "bag and baggage" just as she planned to go out to the post
                    office (see her <a href="duk.00584">September 28, 1871</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). According to this letter, "our company is here yet," but Louisa
                    planned to take her delayed trip to the post office tomorrow. Louisa's daughter
                    Mary came to Brooklyn with husband Ansel and her two daughters Louisa and Mary
                    Isadore "Minnie." Mary had requested a week-long visit for shopping in
                    preparation for her daughter Minnie's approaching marriage in mid-October (see
                    Louisa's <a href="tex.00172">September 15–26, 1871</a> letter to

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
                    George, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n14">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_tex.00180_n14 note" id="tex.00180_n14"><span>Adams Express, founded in
                    the northeast in the 1840s, was a packet and letter service that spread
                    nationally as a reliable alternative to the United States Post Office. Adams
                    Express was noted for its trustworthiness and its guarantee of privacy for
                    shippers, which made it a favorite for conveying material that was deemed
                    valuable or otherwise called for discretion. The Whitmans used Adams Express to
                    transfer larger sums of money both during and after the Civil War, but Walt
                    Whitman generally sent Louisa Van Velsor Whitman smaller sums via the postal
                    service. For the trust accorded to Adams Express, see Hollis Robbins, "Fugitive
                    Mail: The Deliverance of Henry 'Box' Brown and Antebellum Postal Politics," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Studies</span> 50.1/2 (2009), 12–13. </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_tex.00180_n3 note" id="tex.00180_n3"><span>The company that is "here
                    yet" is Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Mary Elizabeth Van Nostrand
                    (1821–1899), her husband Ansel Van Nostrand, and their daughters Louisa
                    and Mary Isadore "Minnie." The four used Louisa's Brooklyn residence as a home
                    base for a full week of shopping in preparation for Minnie's upcoming marriage.
                    For Louisa's anxiety regarding the Van Nostrands' planned visit, see her <a href="tex.00172">September 15–26, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman.
                    For her irritation at their arrival with "bag and baggage," see her <a href="duk.00584">September 28, 1871</a> letter to Walt. Minnie married
                    Leander Jay Young (1846–1937) on October 18, 1871. For the date of the
