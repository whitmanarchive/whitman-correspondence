                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    reference to the Irish Home Rule movement that advocated for self-government for
                    Ireland within the United Kingdom. Charles Stewart Parnell (1846–1891) was
                    an Irish Nationalist Politician, Leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and a
                    Member of Parliament. The First Home Rule Bill, to which Parnell reacted with a
                    mix of support and critique, was defeated in the House of Commons in 1886. For
