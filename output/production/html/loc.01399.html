            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thy postal card of ten days ago has just come. It is so good of thee to write. I am
                ashamed when I think how long a silence I have kept—yet I have thought of thee
                very often I have been so busy—"facilis decensus"—into
                politics!—and when once there, it is hard to get out.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01399.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01399.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01399.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Of course the one miserable thing
                occupying the political field is Parnell's incredible meanness. He has dealt the
                death blow to Home Rule in this generation, I am afraid. I feel so sorry for the
                many Liberals whose one cry and interest has been Home Rule. It is not so unhappy
                for me, because for several years <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> my work has been
                given to what seems to me infinitely more interesting than the machinery of
                politics—the reform of existing social abuses, such as the<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01399.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01399.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01399.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> overwork &amp;
                underpay &amp; the generally wretched conditions under which the poor live—The
                collapse of Home Rule will bring <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">these</span> questions much more
                to the front, but I think it means a Liberal defeat at the next election, as the
                Party is not prepared.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I feel quite in the vein of writing a volume of newspaper "leaders" on the subject,
