            <p class="tei_p">I went to N.Y. yesterday afternoon<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; took a car to Union Square. Johnston<a href="#n0336" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0336">3</a> was just leaving

            been asking to be taken soon to see uncle Walt. And it was very evident from her whole speech
