                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">A few lines to you before going out.—A better morning than yesterday &amp; rather
            promising.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went to N.Y. yesterday afternoon &amp; took a car to Union Square. Johnston was just leaving
            the shop when I arrived, on a pressing business engagement, but gave me a most cordial reception,
            invited me to come again today &amp; introduced me to his daughter May.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01016_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01016_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01016_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I talked with her for 10 or 15 minutes, &amp; was very much pleased with the cordial affectionate
            way in which she spoke of "uncle Walt." Only that morning she said, her youngest brother (aged 9) had
            been asking to be taken soon to see uncle Walt. And it was very evident from her whole speech
            &amp; manner that they all regard you with genuine human affection. And when I left she commissioned
            me to give her best love to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I then went to Walker St. to see Williamson &amp; spent 15 minutes with him. He is
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01017_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01017_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01017_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            living out of town just now &amp; had a train to catch. But he was as friendly as could be &amp; seemed
            pleased to hear about you. I quite enjoyed my short interview with him. Looks well &amp; in good spirits.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am going out shortly to see Bush. Rome is
            arranging to have the afternoon with me, &amp; we will go to New York together &amp; call on Johnston.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing could be more quietly &amp; genuinely <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">homely</span>, more considerate &amp; gentle
            in its kindness than my reception &amp; treatment here</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01018_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01018_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01018_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I like them all very much indeed, &amp; consider it a privilege to know them. It is quite moving
             &amp; pathetic to me at times to see the wistful look (as of a feeling deep &amp; inarticulate) that comes into
             Rome's face when we talk of you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I trust that we shall both see you for a short time tomorrow. (Don't know yet what time we shall arrive.
             But we will go to Traubel's first—perhaps about 11.30 there.)</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you always, &amp; best prayers &amp; wishes</span>
