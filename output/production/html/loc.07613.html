            <p class="tei_p">Feeling ab't fairly—weather not unpleasant, cloudy, &amp; a little cool—am sitting here
                by the oak fire—a middling fair bowel action an hour ago, I go out to the closet
                myself &amp; return—Horace has been in—the L of G. pocket-book ed'n is getting
                along—(probably the press-work to-day—also some of the plates at the plate
                press)—Well the big N Y show seems to have all pass'd over successfully—to me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the
                    idea</span> of it is good, even grand, but I have not enthused ab't it at all—(may be a
                whim, but the most insignificant item in the whole affair has been Harrison himself,
                President for all he is)—So the circus here was a success last night—Ed enjoy'd it
                hugely—&amp; I suppose Dr Baker has gone off (to Minneapolis) immediately after his
                graduation—Mrs. Davis was there—Osler spoke well &amp; was treated to great
                applause—all this in the Phila: Academy wh' must have look'd gayly—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been looking over the May <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Book News</span> and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> (so I may be
                supposed to be posted with current literature)—read Whittier's long N Y centennial
                ode—also Wyatt Eaton's reminiscences (interesting) of J F Millet—the "cold in
                the head" still upon me palpably—stew'd chicken, Graham bread &amp; coffee for my meals
                lately—Ed gives me a good <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">currying</span> every evening—Sleep fairly—Sun bursting forth
                as I write—the great long <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">burr-r-r</span> of the Phila. whistles from factories or shores
                often &amp; plainly here sounding, &amp; I rather like it—(blunt &amp; bass)—some future
                American Wagner might make something significant of it—Guess you must have all
                good times there—occupied &amp; healthy &amp; sufficiently out door—I refresh myself
                sometimes thinking (fancying) ab't you all there—I enclose Mrs. O'C[onnor]'s
                yesterday's card—I send card or something every evn'g—</p>
