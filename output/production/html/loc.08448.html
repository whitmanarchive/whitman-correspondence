                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    returning to his home in Bolton, Lancashire, England, after spending several
                    weeks' traveling in the United States and Canada. Wallace had arrived at
                    Philadelphia on September 8, 1891 (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.210.html">Tuesday, September 8, 1891</a>). Wallace's arrival had been shortly
                    preceded by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had been
                    returning from two months of travel in Europe. Both Bucke and Wallace visited
                    Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days with the poet, Wallace
                    returned with Bucke to London, Ontario, Canada, where he met Bucke's family and
                    friends. Wallace's account of his time with Whitman was published—along
                    with the Bolton physician John Johnston's account of his own visit with the poet
                    in the summer of 1890—in their memoir, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt

                    British poet and journalist, paid a surprise visit to Whitman in Camden on
                    November 2, 1891. An account of the visit was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Press</span> with the title "A Poet's Greetings to a Poet." See

                    Traubel described the account of Whitman's visit with Arnold as "almost
                    idiotic—certainly foolish." See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Springfield
