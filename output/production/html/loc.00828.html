            <p class="tei_p">I will only write you a hasty note this time, as I am pretty tired, &amp; my head feels disagreeable, from being in too much—I was up yesterday to Carver hospital &amp; again saw the man of the 51st, Thos McCowell,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> who told me of George, up to latter part of Thursday, 12th inst. I questioned him, &amp; his story was very clear, so I felt perfectly satisfied—he is wounded in hand, will be transferred soon to New York &amp; may call on you—he is a young Irishman, &amp; seems to be a very good fellow indeed—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have written to George, day before yesterday. Did you send my last letter to Han?—if not send it yet—Mother, I see such awful things—I expect one of these days, if I live, I shall have awful thoughts &amp; dreams—but it is such a great thing to be able to do some real good, assuage these horrible pains &amp; wounds, &amp; save life even—that's the only thing that keeps a fellow up—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, dear mother, I make such reckoning of yet coming on &amp; seeing you—how I want to see Jeff too—O it is too bad I have not written to him so long—&amp; Mat too &amp; little California &amp; all—I am going out now a little while—I remain first rate &amp; well as ever—</p>
