                                —Lord Tennyson is said to be
                                    contemplating a voyage in the Mediterranean, if he can find a
                                    vessel in which he can be protected from his fellow-passengers.
                                    The dread of being mobbed is said to interfere even with the
                                    Poet Laureate's country walks, and a good story is told of his
                                    surprise on one occasion when a fellow-creature passed him
                                    without taking any notice of him whatever. "The fellow seems not
                                    to know who I am!" is said to have been his exclamation.</p>

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
                    Whitman. Wallace, along with Dr. John Johnston (1852–1927), a physician in
                    Bolton, founded the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston
                    and Wallace corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members
                    of the Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet
                    and published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace,

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,
