                    valuable contribution to "Whitman Literature"—from Ingersollism the best
                    that has yet been given—significant both from what he has said &amp; left

                    But as we could not expect <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span> to recognise this we
                    must be thankful for what we have got, as, apart from this, the address is

                    brilliant oratorical achievements. I shall prize the pamphlet very highly for
                    its own sake, but more so because <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> have sent it to

                                —Lord Tennyson is said to be
                                    contemplating a voyage in the Mediterranean, if he can find a
                                    vessel in which he can be protected from his fellow-passengers.
                                    The dread of being mobbed is said to interfere even with the
                                    Poet Laureate's country walks, and a good story is told of his
                                    surprise on one occasion when a fellow-creature passed him
                                    without taking any notice of him whatever. "The fellow seems not
                                    to know who I am!" is said to have been his exclamation.</p>
