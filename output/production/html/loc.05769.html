                <span class="tei_salute"> Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I don't suppose the enclosed will give you nearly so much pleasure as it gives
                    me. But Villiers Stanford is, I
                think, the best composer England has produced since the days of Purcell &amp; Blow,
                and your words will be sent home to hundreds &amp; thousands who had not before seen
                them. How lovely the words read as themes for great music! </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been staying with old friends who have a house you would enjoy—it
                stands all alone on the top of a heath-clad hill, with miles of coppice (young
                woods) below it, and spread out beyond is a rich valley with more wooded hills
                jutting out into it—and you see the storms a long way off travelling up from
                the sea, and you can wander for miles &amp; miles through the woods or over the
                breezy hill—or, as you sit at your window, feel yourself in the very heart of
                a great, beautiful solitude. Very kind, warm friends, too, they are, who leave you
                as free as a bird to do what you like. I have had all the papers, dear friend, &amp;
                have enjoyed them. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Now I am in the heart of the "Black Country," as we call it—black with the
                smoke of thousands of foundries &amp; works of all kinds—staying with Percy
                &amp; his wife. Percy is having a very arduous time here
                starting some Steel Works—&amp; what with his men being inexperienced &amp;
                times bad &amp; the machinery not yet perfectly adjusted, he seems harassed night
                &amp; day—for these things have to be kept going all night too—but I
                hope he will get into smoother waters soon. The little son is rosy &amp; bright
                &amp; healthy—goes to school now, which, being an only child, he enjoys
                mightily for the sake of the companionship of other boys. </p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love from us all, dear friend.</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">A. Gilchrist.</span>
            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p"> Grace &amp; Herby well &amp; busy when
                    I left. </p>
