                <span class="tei_salute"> Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I don't suppose the enclosed will give you nearly so much pleasure as it gives
                    me. But Villiers Stanford<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> is, I
                think, the best composer England has produced since the days of Purcell &amp; Blow,
                and your words will be sent home to hundreds &amp; thousands who had not before seen
                them. How lovely the words read as themes for great music! </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have been staying with old friends who have a house you would enjoy—it
                stands all alone on the top of a heath-clad hill, with miles of coppice (young
                woods) below it, and spread out beyond is a rich valley with more wooded hills
                jutting out into it—and you see the storms a long way off travelling up from
                the sea, and you can wander for miles &amp; miles through the woods or over the
                breezy hill—or, as you sit at your window, feel yourself in the very heart of
                a great, beautiful solitude. Very kind, warm friends, too, they are, who leave you
                as free as a bird to do what you like. I have had all the papers, dear friend, &amp;
                have enjoyed them. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Now I am in the heart of the "Black Country," as we call it—black with the
                smoke of thousands of foundries &amp; works of all kinds—staying with Percy
                &amp; his wife. Percy<a href="#n2000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2000">2</a> is having a very arduous time here
                starting some Steel Works—&amp; what with his men being inexperienced &amp;
                times bad &amp; the machinery not yet perfectly adjusted, he seems harassed night
                &amp; day—for these things have to be kept going all night too—but I
                hope he will get into smoother waters soon. The little son is rosy &amp; bright
                &amp; healthy—goes to school now, which, being an only child, he enjoys
                mightily for the sake of the companionship of other boys. </p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love from us all, dear friend.</span>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
