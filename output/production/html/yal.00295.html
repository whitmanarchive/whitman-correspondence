            <p class="tei_p">The sea ought to be grateful to you; for its shifting mounds &amp; boundless heave have
                been dumb from Eternity until you voiced them in deep human music.
            Is there such a thing as a makrophone, to render in vocal facsimile &amp; miniature
                the thunders &amp; voices of great sounds? It seems to me you do this in yr
                sea-chants. When something new of yrs comes I am as Herder when he rec'd a new book of Richter;<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I am unfitted for anything else—for some
                hours. I am glad you sound a sea-trumpet at the barbican of yr book, for I think you greatest in yr sea-interpretations.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I noticed last yr at Marshfield, as we drove along that marvellous beach with the green waves
                curling over on the polished mirror of the sand, how deftly the wind took each wave
                and tossed back from it a helmet-crest of white spray. I feel terribly presumptuous
                in making a suggestion to you, for there is not a word, a collection of words in yr
                work that is not deeply studied &amp; profoundly implicated in the general tissue of
                the whole,—but what <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">wd</span>​  you say to omitting the fourth line—white-maned
                racers?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> The usage I know is irresistibly suggested to one looking at the waves; but
                then it has been ridden to death by so many poetasters that—well, it is no <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blemish</span> of course in yr magnificent strain of elemental
                music, But you might consider my suggestion, if you think best.</p>

                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
