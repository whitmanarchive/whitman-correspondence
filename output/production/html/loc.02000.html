Well, I do not regret the 15
                months that I spent there in two installments.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Oh! what a sad lesson I learned there of young America.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A line in Leaves of Grass led me to think that you was the very man to get him out of
                the Scrape, or at least to show him his danger, of which he seemed quite ignorant.
                In the Asylum I saw "living bodys" that had been so sadly defiled by forcing <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">semon​ </span></span> thro' the hand as to retain but little of the human.</p>

                from dodging the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">noblist​ </span></span> work of man, because of the expense of raising children, and other
                imaginary <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">trobles​ </span></span>, or as I once heard a young Baptist deacon Say—"I won't have my
                pretty wife all tore to pieces having young-ones." Mad as they are in the Asylum,
                this is greater madness. Could not the coming young America be induced to do this
                noblest work manfully &amp; womanly if benevolent liberals were to form themselves
                into a Society for the purpose of taking naked infants from their mothers bring them
                up naked, and marry them at the age of about eight years bringing all Science &amp;
                all human power to their <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right</span> mating or pairing.</p>

Wilson (1843–1914?) 
                    was the son of Henry Wilson (1805–1870)—a harness and trunk maker—and
                    Ann S. Williams Wilson (1809–1887). Benton Wilson was a U. S. Civil War soldier recovering in Armory Square Hospital 
                    in Washington, D.C., when he met Whitman. Later, Wilson was employed selling melodeons and sewing machines. He also
                    sold life insurance and may have worked as a pawnbroker. He married 
                    Nellie Gage Morrell Wilson (ca. 1841–1892). Nellie had two children, Lewis
                    and Eva Morrell, from a previous marriage, and she and Benton were the parents of five children.
                    Wilson named his first child "Walter Whitman Wilson," after the poet; their other
                    children were Austin, Irene, Georgie, and Kathleen Wilson. Benton Wilson's
                    correspondence with Whitman spanned a decade, lasting from 1865 to 1875. </span></span> [<a href="#r0810b">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02000_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02000_n2"><span>See Benton H.
