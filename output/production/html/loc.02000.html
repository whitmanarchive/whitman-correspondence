            <p class="tei_p">I do not know but Ben told you that I was in the Lunatic
                Asylum during the time that himself John &amp; Charley were <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">recieving​ </span><span class="tei_corr">receiving​
        
      </span></span> hard knocks for Uncle Sam &amp; his dimes. Well, I do not regret the 15
                months that I spent there in two installments.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Oh! what a sad lesson I learned there of young America.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A line in Leaves of Grass led me to think that you was the very man to get him out of
                the Scrape, or at least to show him his danger, of which he seemed quite ignorant.
                In the Asylum I saw "living bodys" that had been so sadly defiled by forcing <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">semon​ </span><span class="tei_corr">semen​
        
      </span></span> thro' the hand as to retain but little of the human.</p>

      </span></span>, or as I once heard a young Baptist deacon Say—"I won't have my
                pretty wife all tore to pieces having young-ones." Mad as they are in the Asylum,
                this is greater madness. Could not the coming young America be induced to do this
                noblest work manfully &amp; womanly if benevolent liberals were to form themselves
                into a Society for the purpose of taking naked infants from their mothers bring them
                up naked, and marry them at the age of about eight years bringing all Science &amp;
                all human power to their <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right</span> mating or pairing.</p>
