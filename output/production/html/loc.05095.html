            <p class="tei_p">Through the kindness of one who I am proud to call a friend, and a Countryman of
                mine, I have an opportunity of writing to you, whose sentiments I agree with and
                whose works I admire. Mr. Rolleston and a Mr. Wilkins, two students of Trinity
                College, Dublin, were the first to draw my attention to your poetical works, of
                which I wish to say a few words. I am an ardent student of the Russian Language, and
                greatly interested in the huge country and its strange people and history. Your book
                is the book for them. Will you allow me to translate the "Leaves of Grass" into
                Russian. It will do good, of that I am perfectly sure. I know the Russian character,
                and say again that the "Leaves of Grass" is the book for them. Awaiting the favour
                of a reply</p>

                <span class="tei_salute">Your sincerely,</span>
