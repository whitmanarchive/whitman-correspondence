            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Your welcom letter of the 27th I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> recd Tuesday but did not feel in a writing moode, so I have delayed it until now. I do not know but you think me rather neglectful in my writing to you but if you knew the pain that I have in my head, the whole of the time you would not think hard of me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt—I am sorry that I am as feeble, and that my friends and likewise my Doctor think that I never shall be able to join my Regt, it is hard for me to gaze or to think of the future, dark clouds seem to be lying in my pathway and I can not seem to remove them nor hide them from my mind, I have tried to look on the bright side of the picture, but Walt—how can I look on the bright side when they are both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">dark</span>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt—I have been verry low since I have been at home, and all that has saved me is good nursing and some one to cheer me (which two things I have had) and now and then a letter from you. I must tell you who I have had to cheer and nurse me, besides my parents and sisters: is a young Lady whom I think the world of, yes : might as well tell you, that it is one I love. I feel she has saved me, in the worst of my sickness she hardly left my room how often have I thought what would become of me if it were not for her.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tuesday, she whent to V[ermon]t on a visit and will not be at home for several weeks, so I want you to write to her for Walt—she is one of the best Ladies in the world. I wish you could see her for I know you would like her and I know you will think a great deal of her for her taking such care of me promise me you will write to her, for it used to make her happy to read one of your letters to me  her address is Nellie F. Clark West Hartford Vt.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will now close hoping to hear from you soon I am yours with love and respect</p>

                    sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital. According to the
                    "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had been in Mobile,
                    Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on furlough. On <a href="nyp.00143">August 18, 1863</a>, Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt
                    informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because of his
                    exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary acknowledged Whitman's letter on <a href="nyp.00145">September 6, 1863</a>, and wrote that Caleb was "not
                    quite as well as when I wrote you before…he wishes me to tell you to keep
                    writing…for your letters do him more good than a great deal of medicine." On
                        <a href="nyp.00146">September 18, 1863</a>, at the expiration of his
                    forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong enough to write: "Walt—In your
                    letters you wish me to imagine you talking with me when I read them, well I do,
                    and it does very well to think about, but it is nothing compared with the
                    original." On <a href="nyp.00150">October 26, 1863</a>, S. H. Childs wrote
                    for Caleb from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set
                    up &amp; suffers considerable pain In his
                    head."
