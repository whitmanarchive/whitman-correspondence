            <p class="tei_p">The package of February magazines, sent on the 16th, arrived safely yesterday. 
                Accept my thanks. I am pleased with the typographical appearance, correctness, &amp;c. of my piece.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a piece, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Thou vast Rondure, Swimming in Space</span>," 
                of which I have to say to you as follows. It is to appear in the April number of 
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Fortnightly Review</span>. Having just received a note from the editor of that Review, 
                Mr. Morley, in which he intimates that he has no objection to its appearing simultaneously in America, 
                I thought I would show it to you. Very possibly, you will not care any how to print a piece 
                which is to appear elsewhere. Should that, however, be no objection, and should you consider 
                the piece available for your purposes, the price is $20. Of course it would have to go in your Number for April. 
                I reserve the right of printing in future book.
            </p>
