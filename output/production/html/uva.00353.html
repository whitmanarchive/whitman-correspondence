            <p class="tei_p">The package of February magazines, sent on the 16th, arrived safely yesterday. 
                Accept my thanks. I am pleased with the typographical appearance, correctness, &amp;c. of my piece.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a piece, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Thou vast Rondure, Swimming in Space</span>," 
                of which I have to say to you as follows. It is to appear in the April number of 
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Fortnightly Review</span>.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Having just received a note from the editor of that Review, 
                Mr. Morley, in which he intimates that he has no objection to its appearing simultaneously in America, 
                I thought I would show it to you. Very possibly, you will not care any how to print a piece 
                which is to appear elsewhere. Should that, however, be no objection, and should you consider 
                the piece available for your purposes, the price is $20. Of course it would have to go in your Number for April. 
                I reserve the right of printing in future book.

                    Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.01614">December 5, 1868</a>. He informed Walt
                    Whitman on <a href="loc.01615">December 14, 1868</a> that if he was to get
                    the poem into the February issue it would be impossible to send proof to
                    Washington. This was the second of Walt Whitman's poems to appear in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>; <a href="per.00033">"Bardic
