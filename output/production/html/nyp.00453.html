            <p class="tei_p">It is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">same publishing</span>, only under a different name. The
                man who runs Rees Welsh's business, (the chief mate of the ship) and who first
                proposed &amp; put through the bargain last June with me—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">David McKay</span>—has formally <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="bought​ ">bo't</span>​  out &amp; assumed R W's miscellaneous &amp; publishing &amp; secondhand

                indeed to me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no</span> change—for really my doings have been
                with <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="McKay​ ">McK</span>​  all along from the beginning—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Specimen Days​ ">S. D.</span>​  sales <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">rather</span> sluggish—(1500 were printed,
                towards 400 remain on the shelves in 23 Ninth St.)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  a long letter from Ezra H Heywood—dated Princeton, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Massachusetts​ ">Mass:</span>​ —Heywood has been arrested by
                Comstock—part at least of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cause</span> appears to be
                sending printed slips by mail with "to a common prostitute" and "a woman waits for
                me"—supplements to Heywood's paper "the Word"—(I believe I will just
                enclose H's letter—slips &amp; all)—My impression is that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Comstock's chief object is to get, (by snap judgment probably) a
                    judicial decision on which he can base a show to go before the P. M.
                    General</span>, (as per the late decision of P.M.G. in such questions)—the
                hearing is to come off before U.S. Commissioner Hallett in Boston, Nov 16—(As
                to the vehement action of the Free religious &amp; lover folk, in their conventions,
                papers &amp;c in my favor—and even proceedings like these of Heywood—I
                see nothing better for myself or friends to do than quietly stand aside &amp; let it
                go on)—what do you think?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">As I write, it is a cloudy moist warmish Sunday, 10¼ a. m. pleasant—quiet
                here—I am up in my 3d story, south-front room, writing this—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is a long &amp; supercilious notice of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Specimen Days​ ">S. D.</span>​  in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N. Y.</span>​  World, Oct 30, I wonder if written by Hurlbert
                himself?—an emanation of that New York nest of little malignants, (Stoddard,
                little Winter, and half a dozen more)—The Boston Herald some weeks since (Oct:
                15) had a lengthy and very warm notice, very judicious extracts (Sylvanus Baxter,
                    author)—the best I have seen from the book's
                own standpoint (which of course is every thing)—Are you then going to make a
                brochure of the Tribune letters?
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good</span>, if so—Shall I furnish you with more detailed and
                verbatim data of the Osgood transaction &amp; correspondence—or have you them
                sufficiently?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Where is Ashton? Is he there in W. &amp; do you see him?
                If so tell him I have not forgotten him—&amp; that I send him &amp; Mrs. A. my

                experiences, that way—the real area altogether <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="untouched​ ">untouch'd</span>​ , but the flat pebble making a few dips as it flies &amp; flits
                along—enough at least to give some living touches and
                contact-points—I was quite willing to make an immensely <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">negative</span> book.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am holding my own in the recovery of my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">half state</span> of
                health—am contemplating some change of base, (residence,
                domicile—sometimes I have thought of coming to Washington, settling there,
                getting a lot &amp; small house in fee simple)—Have you sent Dowden's letter to Dr Bucke? I got a letter from Dr
                    Channing asking me to lecture in the Tilton
                    sisters' course this winter in Boston—but I
                cannot lecture at present—besides I shall certainly not do any thing to
                identify myself specially with free love—</p>
