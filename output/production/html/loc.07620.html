            <p class="tei_p">The word from O'C[onnor] is bad as you see by the enclosed card—in some
                respects the worst yet—I am feeling badly depress'd ab't it to-day as you may
                think—Otherwise nearly the same as usual—fine sunny weather—Horace
                and Ed are going over to Phila: on a hunt for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">out-door
                    chair</span> suitable for me—the pocket-book ed'n of L of G is progressing
                fairly—Wm Ingram has just call'd—he is well—stays mostly at his
                farm—the 1 pm whistle is sounding burr-r-r over the Delaware—the sun is
                pouring down almost hotly out (O that I could be out &amp; move in it) &amp; my dear
                O'C is there in W[ashington] may-be unconscious,—may-be passing from
                life—meanwhile—thought o'ertoppling all else—my old nurse Musgrove
                has just been in to see me. I have a friendly feeling toward him—Tom Harned
                was here last evn'g—He is busy—is always good to me—</p>
