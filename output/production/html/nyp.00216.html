               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter last Saturday—I intended to return day after to-morrow, but shall not be able to, till the last of the week, or the early part of next week. The reason is that my book, which is a little more than half done, does not get along as fast as the printers agreed—&amp; if I do not stay &amp; finish it, (the supervision of it,) it will be botched &amp; full of blunders.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am in good health &amp; all goes well. Andy, dear boy, I hope my delay of a few days will not put you out—Write to me, &amp; tell me about the office, &amp; my friends there. Don't forward any letters that come after Friday next, but put them in my drawer. Once more—I send my love to you &amp; all.</p>
