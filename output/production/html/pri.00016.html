            </span>

I am jogging along still about the same in physical condition—still certainly no worse, &amp; I sometimes lately suspect rather better, or at any rate more adjusted to the situation—Even begin to think of making some move, some change of base, &amp;c. (the doctors have been advising it for over two years, 
                but I hav'n't felt to do it, yet.) My paralysis does not lift—I cannot walk any distance—I still have this baffling, 
                obstinate, apparently chronic affection of the stomachic apparatus &amp; liver—Yet, (as told in former letters) I get out doors 
                a little every day—write &amp; read, in moderation—appetite sufficiently good, (eat only very plain food, 
                but always did that)—digestion tolerable—&amp; spirits unflagging. (As said above, I have told you most of this before, 
                but suppose you might like to know it all again, up to date.) Of course, &amp; pretty darkly coloring the whole, 
                are bad spells, prostrations, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">some pretty grave</span> ones, intervals—&amp; I have resigned myself to the certainty 
                of permanent incapacitation from solid work—but things may continue at least in this half-and-half way, 
                for months—even years.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My books are out, the new edition, a set of which, immediately on 'receiving your letter' of 28<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>, I have

            <p class="tei_p">My dear friend, your offers of help, &amp; those of my other British friends, I think I fully appreciate, 
                in the right spirit, welcome &amp; acceptive—leaving the matter altogether in your &amp; their hands—&amp; to your &amp; their 
                convenience, discretion, leisure &amp; nicety—Though poor now even to penury <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I have not so far been deprived 
                of any physical thing I need or wish whatever—&amp; I feel confident I shall not, in the future</span>. During my 
                employment of seven years or more in Washington after the war (1865–'72) I regularly saved a great part of my

                beginning at present welcome dribbles hitherward from the sales of my new edition which I just job &amp; sell, 
                myself, (as the book agents here for 3 years in New York have successively, deliberately, badly cheated me)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> &amp; shall continue to dispose of the books myself. And <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> is the way I should prefer to glean my support—In that way I cheerfully accept all the aid my friends find it convenient to proffer (Prof. Dowden has sent me 
                the money for seven sets—which I have forwarded to him at Dublin.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I wish you to loan this letter to him to read.) I wish you to notify me—by postal card will do—soon as you receive your books sent on the 15th—I wish you also to loan this letter 
                to Mrs. Gilchrist, first of all. I shall write to her to-day or to-morrow—but briefly.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">To repeat a little, &amp; without undertaking details, understand, dear friend, for yourself &amp; all, that I heartily 
                &amp; most affectionately thank my British friends, &amp; that I accept their sympathetic generosity in the same spirit 
                in which I believe (nay, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span>) it is offered—that 
                though poor <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I am not in want</span>—that I maintain good heart 
                &amp; cheer—&amp; that by far the most satisfaction to me (&amp; I think it can be done, &amp; believe it will be,) will be 
                to live, as long as possible, on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the sales</span>, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">by myself</span>, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">of my own works</span>—&amp; perhaps, if practicable,

                    confused by conflicting press reports as to Whitman's financial straits,
                    Rossetti accepted Whitman's statements in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">West Jersey

                    to prove that we are not insensible of the obligations we owe you." Yet in this
                    letter Whitman was silently modifying his own earlier accounts; in fact, his
                    position as now stated did not materially differ from that in the Springfield
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> which had led to the reply in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">West Jersey Press</span>. Rossetti distributed facsimiles of
