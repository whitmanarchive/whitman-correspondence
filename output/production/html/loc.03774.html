                    1860–1908) was an Irish theatre historian, travel writer, and critic.
                    Sillard lived and worked closely with his brother Peter, a fellow critic, in
                    their native Dublin. In 1908, the brothers moved from Dublin to New York City
                    where they hoped to pursue their literary careers; unfortunately, Robert caught
                    pneumonia and died a few months after their arrival. Sillard is the author of
