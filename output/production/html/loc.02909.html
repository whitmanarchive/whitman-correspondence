               It's so cold I could'nt sleep this morn. Your
                letter alarms me for yr health, somewhat. I have decided to come on &amp; see you in a week or so.
                I will be very careful not to fatigue or bother you. I begin to see that it is
                useless to wait till you are free from other visitors. For Rhys<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> says he

                coming on I could bring my MS with me, &amp; stay three days at least. There is no
                hurry about the MS, for Wilson<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> does not want it of
                course on hand, until the subscribers' names mount up pretty cheerily. He is anxious

                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
