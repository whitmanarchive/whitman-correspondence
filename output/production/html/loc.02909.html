            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your good long letter Jan. 10—recd
               It's so cold I could'nt sleep this morn. Your
                letter alarms me for yr health, somewhat. I have decided to come on &amp; see you in a week or so.
                I will be very careful not to fatigue or bother you. I begin to see that it is
                useless to wait till you are free from other visitors. For Rhys says he
                is coming on to see you too, &amp; you will always be more or less besieged. By
                coming on I could bring my MS with me, &amp; stay three days at least. There is no
                hurry about the MS, for Wilson does not want it of
                course on hand, until the subscribers' names mount up pretty cheerily. He is anxious
                to have it boomed up through, &amp; asks permission to announce it, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I have granted by this mail. I am revising the
                MS. for punctuation &amp; style.—Dr. B. sends me word
                that he will send me a list of Whitmanites. I have already made out a long
                one—going over all my scraps &amp; records for the purpose </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our brilliant young fellow Rhys is booming on here. I assume the papa toward him a
                little. We are trying to rub the British bloom "off 'n him." <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02909.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02909.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02909.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> We go to Sanborn's at Concord <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Friday​ ">Frid</span>​
