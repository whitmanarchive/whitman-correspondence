                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1825–1907) was a bookseller and publisher in London, England. In 1851, he
                    formed a partnership with Osborne Turner (1825–1887), publishing and
                    trading as "Reeves &amp; Turner." Later, Turner's son John (1861–1894) was
                    also involved in the business. Reeves and Turner had expressed interest in
                    becoming the English publishers of Whitman's last miscellany <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span>, and Bucke had spoken to Reeves about publishing
                    Whitman's works while Bucke was traveling in England in the Summer 1891. Bucke
                    had written to Horace Traubel about the matter (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.177.html">Thursday, August 6, 1891</a>). The firm had ordered 100 copies of the
                    book (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.199.html">August 28, 1891</a>), but Whitman told Traubel that they must respect the
                    interests of David McKay of Philadelphia, the volume's American Publisher (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.177.html">Thursday, August 6, 1891</a>). McKay preferred to have Alexander Gardner
                    (1821–1882) of Paisley, Scotland, a publisher who reissued a number of
                    books by and about Whitman, handling the publishing of Whitman's work abroad
                        (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.202.html">Monday, August 31, 1891</a>). In the end, Reeves and Turner did not
                    publish an edition of Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n0240">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0240 note" id="n0240"><span>Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917), also known as
                    Harry Buxton Forman, was most notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley
                    and John Keats. On <a href="loc.01619">February 21, 1872</a>, Buxton sent
                    a copy of R. H. Horne's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Great Peace-Maker: A Sub-marine
                        Dialogue</span> (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying
                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
