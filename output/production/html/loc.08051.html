                &amp; Manchester Guardian 13th rec'd: &amp; others—is now well on to sunset—have had my supper, 
                mainly a dish of strawberries, (good &amp; plenty &amp; cheap now here)—my condition the same 
                continued, bad bad enough—(if my birth-day reveller friends don't look out they will run 
                on as bad a snag as the good friends who went with loving gifts &amp; words to congratulate 
                the old musician &amp; found he was just dead &amp; cold up in the garret)—Suppose you have 
                had the stitched "Good-Bye" I sent Dr [Johnston]—sh'l soon send you &amp; Dr a portrait 
                or mask of self photo just taken, the most <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">audacious</span> thing in its line ever 
                taken—Dr Bucke is still lamed badly—
