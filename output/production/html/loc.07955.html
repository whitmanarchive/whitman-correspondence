                question</span> (as I said) has been turn'd 
                over to T B Harned with absolute power, &amp; he is managing it 
                splendidly—has got me out of a hole—I offer to pay $3000 
                (have paid 1500 &amp; offer 1500 more) wh' it looks now as they were going 
                to accept &amp; close it finally—but a 
                day or two more will decide—Ralph Moore, H[orace] thinks, is free 
                f'm any foul practice, &amp; I accept that &amp; am mighty glad so—Forman writes me that Heineman,
