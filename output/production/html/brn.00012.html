                    Cincinnatus Heine Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of
                    the Rockies" and "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness
                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
                    poetry; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), 60.
                    Whitman met Miller for the first time in 1872; he wrote of a visit with Miller
                    in a <a href="prc.00026">July 19, 1872</a>, letter to his former publisher and
                    fellow clerk Charles W. Eldridge. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_brn.00012_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_genoways tei_note_type_editorial note" id="brn.00012_n1"><span>This note, now tipped

                    a letter of <a href="loc.03140">April 16</a> that Miller would be coming
                    to Camden in early May. Miller asked Whitman to "lay [the two volumes] to one
