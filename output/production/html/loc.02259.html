                    (1859–1942) was a New York-born journalist, writer, and diplomat. He was
                    the author of eight novels, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Like Another Helen</span>
                    (Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1900) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Miss
                        Schuyler's Alias</span> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1913). His poems were
                    often published in newspapers, and many were collected in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sons
                        of the Lowly and Other Poems</span> (Chicago: F. J. Schulte, 1892), including
                    "Walt Whitman" and "To Walt Whitman (On receiving his book)." Horton began
                    writing for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chicago Herald</span> about 1890 and first
                    served as U.S. Consul in Athens, Greece, from 1893 to 1898, before returning to
                    his position at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>. He was then editor at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chicago American Literary Supplement</span> until 1903, when he
                    returned to Greece for a second term as U.S. Consul and married Catherine
                    Sakopoulos. His daughter was the poet Nancy Horton (1912–2016). Beginning
                    in 1911, Horton served as Consul in Smyrna, where in 1922 he witnessed the Great
                    Fire of Smyrna and the Greek Genocide, which he describes in his book, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Blight of Asia</span> (Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill
                    Company, 1926). Horton visited Whitman at his Camden home in November 1890 and
                    later declared "there should be no doubt that Walt Whitman is a poet. . . .
                    There is much music in Whitman, and it is the music of nature itself" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Inter Ocean</span> [March 13, 1892], 17). Whitman, in turn,
                    described Horton as having "a professional look—lawyer-like, physician,
                    artist, something—though he is only a newspaper man, has no further
                    pretensions that I know of" (<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.187.html">Thursday, January 8, 1891</a>). Later, Whitman told Horace Traubel that
                    Horton "manifested his friendliness in many ways" during his 1890 visit (see
                        <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.198.html">Thursday, August 27, 1891</a>, where this letter is reproduced in full).
                    Horton is buried in Washington D.C.'s Oak Hill Cemetery and his papers are
                    housed at Georgetown University, including his inscribed copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> from Whitman. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02259_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02259_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:

                    was being planned in celebration of 400 years since Columbus's "discovery" of

                    and the World's Columbian Exposition opened in 1893. Although Whitman passed
                    away seven months prior to the dedication ceremonies for the Exhibition, Andrew
                    Vogel has argued that Whitman's poem "A Thought of Columbus," was "dedicated to
