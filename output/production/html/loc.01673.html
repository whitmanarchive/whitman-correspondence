            <p class="tei_p">The money came all right, &amp; I will keep it for the present, &amp; use it for myself,—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">but only to return it 
                at some future time, when I am</span> flush. Nothing very new with me. I still feel pretty well, for me, (&amp; 
                considering the past four years.) Who knows? May be after this winter, I shall feel well enough to come 
                on to Washington &amp; make out several weeks—&amp; we'll have a good time together, my loving son—(no more 
                long <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">walks</span>, to be sure—but we can be happy other ways)

                own dinner <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="stewed​ ">stew'd</span>​  chicken &amp; nice roast potatoes—&amp; now (2½) up stairs in my room writing this,

            <p class="tei_p">O Pete, you get that arm chair (with the broken arm) I left at Mrs Nash's,—perhaps the broken arm 
                is still there, if so get it put on—then take the chair home for you as a new year's present, 
                &amp; for your mother to sit in, &amp; you afterwards—you know I used the chair for a year, &amp; if I 
                recollect right, it is a good strong one, though plain—I am glad to hear what you wrote about 
                your mother—Every thing about fellows' old mothers is interesting to me—</p><p class="tei_p">—Give my love to Mr &amp; Mrs Nash—</p>
