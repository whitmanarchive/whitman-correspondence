            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">rec'd letters f'm Dr J[ohnston] Bolton, yesterday—all
                well—went out latter afternoon on a drive four miles out to "Pea Shore" (Mrs.
                    Bush, Horace &amp;
                I)—fine fresh moist south east breeze, welcome to me— M D Conway here yesterday an hour talking &amp; inquiring ab't Tom
                Paine—(wh' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">life</span> he is soon to pub. in book)—with altogether my poor brain was wrapped all up
                like an apple-dumpling—restful &amp; quiet day to-day—Hope you share the
                long stretch of fine cool sunny weather we are having here—Warry well &amp; blooming— Miss D[avis] ditto—I continue same as before (thankful it's no
                worse)—but bad enough <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">when I'm not on parade</span>—I
                enclose Ernest Rhys's letter f'm Wales—he must be having
                good times—(he is a handsome smart <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">litterateur</span> worthy
                of a better fate)—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1891-09-14">Sept. 14</span>—fine weather continued—thank you for y'r good letter rec'd this
                mn'g—also Dr B[ucke]'s— I can almost see the whole
                scene, the lawn, the evn'g shades, the crowd, Dr's return, y'r
                arrival—&amp; hear the band—my friend, take
                my advice, resign yourself tacitly to rest &amp; absorb quietly, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">reposeful</span> for a while, tying up for the nonce—I appreciate y'r
                loving wishes, as ever— </p>
