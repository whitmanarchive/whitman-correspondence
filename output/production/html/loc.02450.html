                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1865–1945) was from Manchester, England, one of five children born to
                    Thomas Mercer (1836–1893)—a silk manufacturer—and Alice Holden
                    (1837–1921). In 1899, he married Helena Harriet Tippins (1872–1939)
                    and the couple had two children, Geoffrey Edmund (1901–1981) and Robert
                    Osborn (1909–1995). English census data record Mercer as a solicitor
                    living in Manchester. His sonnet "Blue and Gold" appeared in the August 24,
                    1889, issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chambers's Journal</span> (544); he also
                    regularly contributed essays to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Manchester Quarterly</span>,
                    published by the Manchester Literary Club, of which he was at one time a Council
                    Member. When Mercer died in 1945, he was working for the firm of Maurice Rubin
                    and Company, and his obituary in volume eleven of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Law

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
