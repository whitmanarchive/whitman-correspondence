            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very sorry to be so late with my reply to your note, which was received by me just on leaving home to go to Canada, &amp; thence to some of your West N.Y. cities, a journey which has left me no leisure for writing notes to diplomatists, until today.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you wish to live in that least attractive (to me) of cities, I must think you can easily do so. Perhaps better in the journalism than in the Departments.
You will see that I have dated my note from my known residence. With best hope,</p>
