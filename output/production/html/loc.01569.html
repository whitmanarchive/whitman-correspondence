            <p class="tei_p">In compliance with request in your name in letter from George Routledge &amp;
                Sons, New York, of December 28th &amp; my own reply thereto of December
                    30th, I send you herewith a poem for the
                Magazine, if found acceptable. For my own convenience &amp; to insure
                correctness I have had the MS. put in type, &amp; thus transmit it to you in the
                shape of a printed proof. The price is $120 in
                gold, payable here, and I should like 30 copies of the Magazine, sent me here. It is
                to be distinctly understood that I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">reserve</span> the right to print
                it in any future editions of my book. Hoping success to the Magazine, &amp; that
                my piece may be found acceptable for it, I remain</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Respectfully &amp;c yours,</span>
