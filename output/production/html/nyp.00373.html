        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John Burroughs,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been back here two weeks &amp; over—My Washington jaunt occupied some seventeen or eighteen days, 
        &amp; was a very pleasant one for me—(started out with the idea of a two days visit only)—Am perhaps now lately 
        not so well, but not much different—the gravest trouble is the liver and stomachic business now—Still I keep 
        up about the same, (&amp; get mad at myself for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grunting</span>)—Your letter of two days since <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ . 
        Best love to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Ursula​ ">'Sula</span>​ , &amp; to Jenny Grant if there—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">My new edition is nearly ready—Two <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Volumes​ ">Vols</span>​ —will give you early advice of their appearance—only 100 copies issued—Is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Winter Sunshine</span> out? Eldridge call'd to see me on his return home two weeks since. Marvin has gone to England, 
        with a Treas[ury] squad. He has call'd on Mrs. Gilchrist. M. D. Conway called on me. Lord Houghton also.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">We have great times in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this house</span>—a baby has arrived, a fine lusty little fellow, now five weeks old—(he has been named Walt)—just now though he is quite sick, but I opine will get along—The rest all very well, except that my sister, 
        the mother, is part of the time only middling. I hear young Walt raising <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his</span> song, in the room overhead as 
        I conclude my letter—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Love to you, as always, my friend—</span>
        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt.</span>
