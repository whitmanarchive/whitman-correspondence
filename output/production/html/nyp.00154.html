                    private in Company I of the 120th New York Infantry, was wounded at the Battle
                    of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. Whitman noted that Vandemark was placed in

                    furlough and was briefly transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps during the
                    summer of 1864 before returning to his regiment. He was killed on a skirmish
                    line during the charge on Fort Davis at Petersburg, Virginia, on September 28,
                    1864. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
