            <p class="tei_p">Accept of my best thanks for your kind letter with the enclosed slips of your article
                on "Old Poets," which I received on the 13<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst. the
                article is one of great interest to me intrinsically; and extrinsically because of

            <p class="tei_p">I conveyed your loving salutation &amp; benediction to J W Wallace and in a letter to me in which he tells me of certain worries &amp; troubles he
                says that it is "like a message of comfort from the skies" to him, &amp; he
                continues—"God bless <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span>! Say I &amp; my grateful

                Wentworth Dixon) I read "The Carpenter"—at least the most of it—which
                took me nearly two hours, and much did they all enjoy that splendid story and the
                charming glimpses it gives of your personality &amp; influence—some of them
                being "fetched" by parts of it; and no wonder, for it is a most moving story and
                powerfully told. At next meeting (Nov<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> 17<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>) I shall read your letter &amp; your article to

            <p class="tei_p">We have had some typical English November weather here lately—a good deal of
                rain and fog—but this has been a truly delightful day of gladsome, benignant
                sunshine—a welcome "halcyon days" before the winter settles upon us.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02449.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02449.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02449.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I have just returned
                from the Bolton Chrysanthemum Show in our Town Hall where I have spent a very
                pleasant hour promenading, listening to the strains of our grand organ &amp; looking
                at the really fine display of gorgeously tinted bloom—quite a pleasant break
                in my professional work.</p>
