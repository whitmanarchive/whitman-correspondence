                Along with your dear p.c. came good letters from J.W.W.

                I shall not write to J.W.W. by this mail as usual, as he will probably have

                sweethearts &amp; their wives &amp; succeeded in holding their interest 
                for an hour &amp; a half while I talked about my American

                Fred Wild with me to our new Turkish Baths—of 
                wh. I am a director—&amp; this being his first "Turkish" experience it was
                as good as pantomime to see him, &amp; better, to hear his uniquely &amp; inimitably 
                quaint &amp; humorous remarks &amp; criticisms
                all given in broad "Bowton" dialect—of the various operations &amp; processes to 
                which he was subjected at the hands of the shampooer. For example 
                the scrubbing brush was "a cat let out of a bag and clawing at him." 
                The wooden pillow had "the feathers the wrong way up":
                the tapping &amp; pounding was "playing the piano on his ribs" &amp;c &amp;c. 
                At the end he felt so invigorated
                that he wanted to know if there was anybody, about his own size &amp; weight, 
                who wanted to fight! He is a born humourist
                &amp; a downright good fellow.
