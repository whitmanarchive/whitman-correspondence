                will try once more to write
                A line to say we are all about the same
                only the
                hot weather is disappeard in some measure
                it was bad enoughf here we had awfull
                bad smells mr hambler
                said it came from
                the privy s in pacific st the yards in that
                street backs up to ours
                but they are very
                or quite respectable houses he said he had
                complained to the board of health but
                whither they have done any
                thing or not we dont
                smell it to day) the sewer i believe is not in
                that street there is a water closet in this yard
                when we came here it was all out of order
                dident work at all I told the man I wished
                he would have it fixed but he dident doo
                it then i told the landlady it made me sick
                every time i went in so after a while he
                went to work and fixed it they are so fraid
                of laying out one cent and want such A
                high rent I paid him the rent last night
                that makes fifty doll since we have been) here
                we pay in advance i told george
                300 dolrs
                A year would help on a house its too much
                rent but we couldent doo no better then
                if we only had one more room or the
                bedrooms were any size but they are
                so small the rooms is very deep but
                not very wide they are 40 feet deep
                i got so many envelopes i shall have
                to write whether im lame or not they

                getting a house i think its about the worst
                and most disagreable fix any one can be
                in Walt doo you know i like his writings
                the good gray poet better than i doo borroug<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">hs</span> book
                Oconers shows the spirit its wrote
                in i should form an idea of the man if i
                had never seen him by reading his writing
