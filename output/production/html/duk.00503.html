                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    Whitman's connection to Lane offered assurance of stable employment. Lane later

                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">14. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00503_n10 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00503_n10"><span><p class="tei_p"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> is William D.

                    <p class="tei_p">John Burroughs (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of
                        Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
                        commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs.
                        Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence
                        between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
                        "matter-of-fact." Burroughs wrote several books involving or devoted to
                        Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting the Universe</span> (1924).

                    had spotted an unsigned <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> reprint of William
                    Michael Rossetti's influential review ("<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/bibliography/entry.html?id=20250">Walt
                        Whitman's Poems</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Chronicle</span>,
                    July 6, 1867, 362–363). Though Walt Whitman was already aware that Rossetti was preparing a
                    London edition of his poems, he may not have yet known the
                    exact nature of Rossetti's commentary on him in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London
                        Chronicle</span> review because in his <a href="pml.00022">July 27, 1867</a>,
                    letter to Abby H. Price he had requested her assistance in acquiring "two or
                    three copies" of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> reprint of Rossetti's review.
                    In the review, Rossetti described <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> as "incomparably the largest poetic work of our
                    period" (see "Current Literature," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, July
                    28, 1867, 2). Walt Whitman had forwarded a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> for "republication in England" (see his <a href="uva.00350">July 24, 1867</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway). In his <a href="pri.00011">November 1, 1867</a>, letter to Conway, Whitman
                    stated, "I have no objection to [Rossetti's] substituting words." Whitman
                    hesitated but ultimately accepted the compromise necessary to bring his work to
                    a British public, but he later regretted acquiescing. Rossetti's expurgated
                    edition appeared as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html">Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael
                            Rossetti</a></span> (London: Hotten, 1868). </span></span> [<a href="#r15">back</a>]</li></ul>
