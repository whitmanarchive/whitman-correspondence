                    <p class="tei_p">On November 15, 1875, sixteen Washingtonians sent a petition to Benjamin H.
                        Bristow, Secretary of the Treasury: "We respectfully ask that Walt Whitman,
                        'the Good Gray Poet,' may be appointed to a position in the Treasury
                        Department." The docket in the National Archives reads: "The Secretary says
                        give the applicant a place Jany. 1, '76 if possible." Though Whitman
                        apparently did not comment on this proposal, Burroughs knew of it, and wrote
                        to Dowden in April 1876: "We expected he would have a position in one of the
                        Departments at Washington again before this, as it was promised last winter,
                        but nothing seems to come of it yet" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
