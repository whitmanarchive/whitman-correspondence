                    Forman (1842–1917) was a British man-of-letters, an editor of and

                    conspirator in literary forgeries that were exposed after his death. The
                    correspondence at this time between Bucke and Forman makes it clear that Bucke
                    was also building up Forman's collection of Whitman materials (D. B. Weldon

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
