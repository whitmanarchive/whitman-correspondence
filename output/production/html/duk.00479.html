                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were

                        Though Louisa Van Velsor Whitman referred most often to her granddaughter as

                        Manahatta became "Hattie"—Walt Whitman apparently bestowed the private
                        nickname "California" on Jessie Louisa shortly after her birth (see his <a href="loc.00805">December 15, 1863</a> letter to Louisa). According
                        to Louisa's <a href="duk.00478">March 21, 1867</a> letter to Walt,
                        Jessie Louisa recognized the name's association with Walt: "she calafor when

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken

                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
