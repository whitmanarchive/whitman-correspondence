                there as we are here—we had quite a snow storm here three or four nights ago, 
                &amp; since then it has cleared off bitter cold,—(thermometer at 10 above, an hour ago, 
                at our west door.)—Still I go out some, though very stiff—&amp; lately some spells 
                in my head rather bad &amp; queer. What I have said in former letters about my general 
                strength still holds good—otherwise I am in a bad way yet &amp; dont consider myself

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
