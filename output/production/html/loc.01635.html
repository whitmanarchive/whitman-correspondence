            <p class="tei_p">Well son, how do you make out this cold weather?—for I suppose you are having it 
                there as we are here—we had quite a snow storm here three or four nights ago, 
                &amp; since then it has cleared off bitter cold,—(thermometer at 10 above, an hour ago, 
                at our west door.)—Still I go out some, though very stiff—&amp; lately some spells 
                in my head rather bad &amp; queer. What I have said in former letters about my general 
                strength still holds good—otherwise I am in a bad way yet &amp; dont consider myself 
                out of the woods, have not been so well as usual the last week </p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01635.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01635.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01635.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><p class="tei_p">If you come across the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Weekly Graphic</span> just out get it, as I have commenced a series 
                of pieces about things just before &amp; during the war. The series is to continue through four or five numbers. 
                Get one for Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash—Pete I rec'd the "Golden Grain"—also the letter, Herald,—&amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Republican​ "><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Repub</span></span>​ —send me one of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the latter</span>, occasionally—I had rather have it than any—(but you needn't put yourself out to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">get it</span>)—As I write the sun is shining bright &amp; clear as can be—the ground is white 
                with snow in all directions, it is not melting anywhere—as I crossed the river 
                yesterday toward dusk, the old fellow, the chargè of the ferry house, told me 
                that between 12 &amp; 2 o'clock the previous night over 30 persons crowded in there, 
                poor houseless creatures, to keep from freezing to death—he keeps a great stove 
                red-hot all night—some were young, some old, some evidently real respectable people—the orders are to not allow it, but he hadn't the heart to turn 'em out—God help the homeless &amp; moneyless this weather—</p>
