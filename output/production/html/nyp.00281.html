            <p class="tei_p">I have nothing particular to write about, but I thought I would just write a line. I
                hope you have stood the hot weather, without giving out—&amp; George too I
                hope he exercises more care about himself, because I think our family is more liable
                than many to the effects of the great heat &amp; exposure to the sun—I have
                got along pretty well, but it has been awful hot—&amp; continues so, though
                as I write here by my window, there has quite a cool breeze sprung up since I
                commenced writing—Fortunately, I sleep very well nights—there has been
                only one night I haven't slept comfortably—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We have a new Attorney General, Mr. Evarts,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> as I suppose you have seen by the papers—He hasn't
                made his appearance here yet—but is expected soon—I only hope he will
                be as agreeable for a boss as the others have been—but somehow I don't
                believe he will—I am really sorry to have Binckley go, for he was a good
                friend of mine—&amp; Mr. Browning too—Mother, I do hope you will get
                through this awful spell, all right—it can't last much longer—&amp;
                George too—Mother, don't look for the next letter till <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Wednesday next</span>—I have had a letter from Jeff<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—all are well &amp; hearty, except Mat has some cough
                yet—take care of yourself, dear mother.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Your letter has come to-day, mother—John Burroughs has returned—he
                    has a good piece in Putnam's for August—<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>

                    General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and
