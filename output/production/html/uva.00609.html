                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    1866–?) was the brother of Warren Fritzinger, who would serve as Whitman's
                    nurse beginning in October 1889. Harry worked as an office boy in Camden when he
                    was fourteen. He also worked as a sailor. Later, he became a railroad conductor.
                    Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, took care of both Harry and Warren after the
                    death of their father, the sea captain Henry W. Fritzinger. Davis had looked
                    after Capt. Fritzinger, who went blind, before she started to perform the same
                    housekeeping services for Whitman. Harry married Rebecca Heisler on September
                    15, 1890. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
