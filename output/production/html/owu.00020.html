                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The sun shines out bright &amp; cheerful this morning—&amp; in my east window I
                have a fine healthy rose-bush—I see it has got two roses, in bloom, &amp; one
                just budding out—(it was a present from Mrs. Channing of Providence—she sent on here, and had it got for
                me, when I was first sick)—I think I am feeling better to-day, &amp; more like
                myself—I have been in the habit of soaking my feet in hot water every night
                for two months now—&amp; I think lately it has done me more harm than
                good—one thing is, it has probably made me catch a slight cold—so I have <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">stopt​ </span><span class="tei_corr">stopped​
        
      </span></span> it, &amp; I have a notion I feel better from stopping it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I have just
                had my breakfast, &amp; am sitting here alone by the stove, writing
                this—Charles Eldridge will be here in a few
                minutes, &amp; bring the morning papers—he comes &amp; sits a few minutes
                every morning before going to work—he has been very good indeed—he &amp;
                Peter Doyle hold out through every thing—most of the rest
                have got tired &amp; <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">stopt​ </span><span class="tei_corr">stopped​
        
      </span></span> coming—(which is just as well)—Mrs. O'Connor comes whenever she can, &amp; generally brings a dish of roast
                apples, or something—</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00020.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fowu.00020.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fowu.00020.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I go over to the office about 12 or 1 most every day——but only for a few
                minutes—have not resumed work there yet, but hope to, Monday—I find
                there is a great deal of paralysis around, and they say I have got along very
                well—but it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">​ </span><span class="tei_corr">is​
        
      </span></span> so slow, so aggravating, to be disabled, so feeble, cannot walk nor do any
                thing, when one's mind &amp; will are just as clear as ever—Still <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I feel</span> I shall get as well as usual yet dearest
                mother—&amp; then I shall <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">surely</span> get here or buy or
                build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed and me—I realize it more, far
                more now, than ever—even for my own comfort—this spring is better to buy
                here than usual—I think we could get along <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very well</span>
                indeed—you could visit George &amp; Lou as often as you
                liked (&amp; George &amp; Lou could come &amp; pay us a visit in winter when
                Congress is in full blast)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I miss John &amp; Mrs. Burroughs—they are at a place called Waukill, N.Y. state—they have hired out
                their house furnished, 6 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="months​ ">mo's</span>​ , 
                $50 a month. I have not heard any thing further from Jeff—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I hope to come on soon &amp; pay you all a visit,
                but wait to see how things go in the office—&amp; how I feel—(as I have
                been absent now nine weeks)—Every thing looks pleasant here to-day—quite
                spring like—Mother dear, I hope this will find you feeling well, &amp; in good
                spirits, as that is the main thing.—Mother as I cannot get down to the p.o. I
                send the money once more enclosed—write me Sunday, if convenient—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Charles​ ">Chas.</span>​  Eldridge has been in—it is now later, towards 12—I have washed
                &amp; put on some clean clothes, &amp; am going over to the office—</p>
