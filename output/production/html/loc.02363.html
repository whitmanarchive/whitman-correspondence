                Moore. Miss Moore was speaking to me of your poetry yesterday as she and I were

                London on her way. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Miss Moore has just had her first book published, "Mary Wolstonecraft

            <p class="tei_p">I was more than pleased to receive the papers you sent me in which I found so much
                about you. I am sorry I could not have heard the lecture on Lincoln, there is a

                to write me even a line I shall be much pleased. There is something about a written
                word from one that brings more happiness than anything excepting the person himself. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Again many thanks for the papers and I trust that the letter of introduction I gave
                to Miss Moore will be agreeable to you and you will not feel I have taken too much
