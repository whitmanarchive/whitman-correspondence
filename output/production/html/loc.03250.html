                    (1857–1940) was an American utopian anarchist, founder of The Comradeship
                    of Free Socialists and the group's magazine, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Free
                        Comrade</span>. A brief autobiographical note appears in Richard Maurice
                    Bucke's seminal work, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the
                        Evolution of the Human Mind</span> (Philadelphia: Innes and Sons, 1905),
                    describing his various careers—including "hygienic physician,"
                    homesteader, poultry farmer, and Florida orange-grower—as well as his wide
                    exposure to world religions and political philosophies (284–285). Lloyd
                    was the author of several books of poetry, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Wind–Harp Songs</span> (Buffalo, New York: The Peter Paul Book Company,
                    1895), which contains the ode "Mount Walt Whitman," written on the occasion of
                    Whitman's death in 1892. In this poem, Lloyd declares, "Ah, Walt, Walt, poet of
                    Nature, comrade of free men, / Other poets have been Olympian, / But you are
                    Olympus itself" (35). Lloyd was connected to other Whitman disciples, including
                    Edward Carpenter, Horace Traubel, and John Johnston, of the Bolton Whitman
                    Fellowship. Like Carpenter, Lloyd was interested in the study of sexology. Lloyd
                    was also the author of a sex manual, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Karezza Method or
                        Magnetation: The Art of Connubial Love</span> (Privately Printed, 1931). For
                    more information, see Terence S. Kissack, "Whitman and the Shifting Grounds of
                    the Politics of Homosexuality," in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Free Comrades: Anarchism
                        and Homosexuality in the United States, 1895–1917</span> (Oakland: AK
