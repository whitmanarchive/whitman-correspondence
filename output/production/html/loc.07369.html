            <p class="tei_p">S. was away when your picture came, attending his sick brother, Charles—who has since died—an event that has sadden'd me much. Charlie was younger than S., and a most attractive young
            fellow. He work'd at my father's, and had done so for two years. He was
            about the best specimen of a young country farm-hand I ever knew. You
            would have loved him. He was like one of your poems. With his great
            strength, his blond hair, his cheerfulness and contentment, his universal
            good will, and his silent manly ways, he was a youth hard to match. He 
            was murder'd by an old doctor. He had typhoid fever, and the old fool
            bled him twice. He lived to wear out the fever, but had not strength to
            rally. He was out of his head nearly all the time. In the morning, as he
            died in the afternoon, S. was standing over him, when Charlie put up his
            arms around S.'s neck, and pull'd his face down and kiss'd him. S. said
            he knew then the end was near. (S. stuck to him day and night to the last.)
            When I was home in August, Charlie was cradling on the hill, and it was a
            picture to see him walk through the grain. All work seem'd play to him.
            He had no vices, any more than Nature has, and was belov'd by all who
            knew him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have written thus to you about him, for such young men belong to
            you; he was of your kind. I wish you could have known him. He had the
            sweetness of a child, and the strength and courage and readiness of a
            young Viking. His mother and father are poor; they have a rough, hard
            farm. His mother works in the field with her husband when the work
            presses. She has had twelve children.</p>
