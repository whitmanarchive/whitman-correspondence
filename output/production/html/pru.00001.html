                    Burroughs, as well as Whitman, whose portrait he worked on from 1886 to

                    on Monday, February 22, 1886, Whitman sat for a portrait by Alexander. On <a href="loc.08284">April 17, 1891</a>, Alexander informed Whitman that one
                    of the poet's admirers had purchased and presented the painting to the
                    Metropolitan Museum of Art: "I am delighted to have been the means of giving to
                    future generations a portrait of you that is certainly one of my best works"
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The
                    naturalist John Burroughs, however, termed the portrait "a Bostonese
                    Whitman—an emasculated Whitman—failing to show his power and
                    ruggedness" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
