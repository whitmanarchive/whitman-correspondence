                Dr Bucke —If you wish it, I will send you (it is a
                handsome little Vol.) one of Eng: pub'd "Spec. Days"—Tell me in your next
                    letter—Baxter has written me to say I can count on
                $800—that 600 are already subscribed—&amp; that he has 300 in hand which
                he can send me soon as I say the word. Nothing
                new—hot, hot here—Gilchrist, Morse, &amp; J N Johnson here as I write—I
                am so-so—</p>
