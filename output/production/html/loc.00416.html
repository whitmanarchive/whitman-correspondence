                    (1807–1877), a prominent civil engineer and cofounder of the American
                    Society of Civil Engineers (1852), superintended the construction of the
                    Brooklyn Water Works as chief engineer from 1856 to 1862. After his work in
                    Brooklyn, he moved to St. Louis and designed the waterworks which Jeff would
                    later build. Kirkwood eventually became a nationally known independent
                    consultant and wrote the standard text on water filtration. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00416_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00416_n2"><span>John D. Martin was an

                    As Jeff explains, he was thinking specifically of the fall of Vicksburg, but he

                    Henry W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic
                    party split between war Democrats and peace Democrats. To satisfy the war
                    Democrats McClellan was nominated; to satisfy the peace Democrats C. L.
                    Vallandigham and his followers were allowed to draft the platform. Jeff
                    evidently considered the entire Democratic party as "the peace party." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00416_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00416_n7"><span>This letter is not
