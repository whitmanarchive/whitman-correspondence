                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
