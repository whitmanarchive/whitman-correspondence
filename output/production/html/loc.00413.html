               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Bro. Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Lane recd. your letter this morning<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> and would have probably answered it to-day but has had to go out in the country (to Jamaica) to make some arrangements for a visit that the Common Council and Water Board intend to make over the works. In his behalf I return thanks for your kindness as regards Horace.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Mr Lane however has heard from him  He was in the thickest of the fight but was not harmed although he had some pretty narrow escapes  He says that some of the rebs took pretty good aim at him</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, your letter has given me a great deal of pleasure, so it has Mr Lane in regard to Hooker and his movements.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I am so glad to understand that he is going in again. Tis sure that he could not have been badly whipped or he could not have done that, And Lee as you say must have been badly hurt or he would never let Hooker come across the river without molestation  I wish you could send me letters oftener. I like to get your ideas of matters and also hear what the people down in Wash'tn think. Twas rather blue here for a few days, almost every one thought it was another bad defeat.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all thriving as usual. Mother is about the same as ever, somewhat lame with the rheumatism but not much  the rest are all well. Andrew had a letter yesterday from Jim Cornwell,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> enclosing him $50 and telling him to come immediately to Suffolk,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> at the bottom was a transportation order from Frank Spinola.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> Cornwell said if he did not come to give the money to his (Cornwells) wife, but to come sure if possible. I think Andrew very foolish not to go, as Ruggles<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> says he certainly will never get <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">well</span> of his throat here. Andrew was to come for me and we were going to see the Dr. to-day abt his going but he did not come and mother thinks that he has concluded <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> to go. I think it would be much better for him to go  I think it would be better for his health, dont you? They must intend to give him a pretty good show or they would not send "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">surely come</span>" for him. We do not here from either Han or George do you? Hattie is the same as ever ever wanting to be out doors and wonders if Uncle Walt will never come and take her out on "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ft. Greene</span>."<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> She seems to remember you first rate and George too. What abt the pictures, shall I send them? The letter does not come out in the Eagle and probably will not but to make again sure I will call to-morrow and look over their file for some weeks back to see if I have possibly overlooked it. All send their love</p>

                    letter to Moses Lane from <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>. Lane
                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27, 1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an
                    unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
                    Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
                    quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
                    Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
                    there.)" Lane assisted Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from
                        <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00413_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00413_n2"><span>Some casualties from
                    the Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers were in Washington hospitals, and Walt had
                    promised "to make immediate inquiry" to determine whether Horace Tarr, the
                    nephew of Moses Lane, was among them (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,

                    there north must not be so disheartened about Hooker's return to this side of
                    the Rappahannock and supposed failure. The blow struck at Lee &amp; the rebel
                    sway in Virginia, &amp; generally at Richmond &amp; Jeff Davis, …is in my
                    judgment the heaviest and most staggering they have yet got from us, &amp; has
                    not only hit them nearer where they live than all Maclellan ever did, but all
                    that has been levelled at Richmond during the war" (see Whitman's letter to
                    Moses Lane from <a href="loc.00769">May 11,

                    remains somewhat of a mystery as to why Andrew was beckoned only as far as
                    Suffolk." Perhaps Andrew was to travel to Suffolk by boat, at which point
                    Cornwell could have met him and conducted him to New Bern, North Carolina, by
                    land. Andrew never made the trip (166). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00413_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00413_n6"><span>See Jeff's letter to
