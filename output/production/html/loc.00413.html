               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Bro. Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Lane recd. your letter this morning and would have probably answered it to-day but has had to go out in the country (to Jamaica) to make some arrangements for a visit that the Common Council and Water Board intend to make over the works. In his behalf I return thanks for your kindness as regards Horace. Mr Lane however has heard from him  He was in the thickest of the fight but was not harmed although he had some pretty narrow escapes  He says that some of the rebs took pretty good aim at him</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, your letter has given me a great deal of pleasure, so it has Mr Lane in regard to Hooker and his movements. I am so glad to understand that he is going in again. Tis sure that he could not have been badly whipped or he could not have done that, And Lee as you say must have been badly hurt or he would never let Hooker come across the river without molestation  I wish you could send me letters oftener. I like to get your ideas of matters and also hear what the people down in Wash'tn think. Twas rather blue here for a few days, almost every one thought it was another bad defeat.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all thriving as usual. Mother is about the same as ever, somewhat lame with the rheumatism but not much  the rest are all well. Andrew had a letter yesterday from Jim Cornwell, enclosing him $50 and telling him to come immediately to Suffolk, at the bottom was a transportation order from Frank Spinola. Cornwell said if he did not come to give the money to his (Cornwells) wife, but to come sure if possible. I think Andrew very foolish not to go, as Ruggles says he certainly will never get <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">well</span> of his throat here. Andrew was to come for me and we were going to see the Dr. to-day abt his going but he did not come and mother thinks that he has concluded <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> to go. I think it would be much better for him to go  I think it would be better for his health, dont you? They must intend to give him a pretty good show or they would not send "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">surely come</span>" for him. We do not here from either Han or George do you? Hattie is the same as ever ever wanting to be out doors and wonders if Uncle Walt will never come and take her out on "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ft. Greene</span>." She seems to remember you first rate and George too. What abt the pictures, shall I send them? The letter does not come out in the Eagle and probably will not but to make again sure I will call to-morrow and look over their file for some weeks back to see if I have possibly overlooked it. All send their love</p>
