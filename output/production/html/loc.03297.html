            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I got yours of the 29th ultimo, with the slip from The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Critic</span>. It is a magnificent compliment, and
                was inexpressibly comforting. John Burroughs told me when he
                was here, and has since written to the same effect, that what I say on the question
                does not touch him at all, and although one <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03297.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> does not mind such things at
                first, yet gradually, and especially when they are only part of one concurrent
                voice, they more than half persuade one that he is a visionary jackass, and have a
                deeply disheartening effect—all the more, I think, when one's convictions on
                the matter are clear and deep. There is nothing more evident to me than what
                Machiavel in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Prince</span> did for tyranny—i.e. sow
                death for it by <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03297.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                simply showing it up without bias and with perfect candor—Bacon (i.e.
                Shakespeare) did for feudality. It is the old story of the basilisk—if you see
                him first, he dies. In the plays—the historical plays especially—Bacon
                sees the basilisk in all his nature and proportions. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I regret I am not free of office life, for I am sure I could make Bacon's part in
                all this matter so evident that Time would remember it. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03297.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Criticism on Shakespeare has not
                yet begun, nor can it ever begin, until the coincidence with the Baconian
                movement—the divine conspiracy of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Novum Organum</span>
                against false civilization—is recognized. So far comment on Shakespeare has
                been merely esthetic. But the relation of that drama to that age—that
                marvellous "time-bettering age"—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> is the main question. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am extremely gratified <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03297.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> at the reinforcement your article brings. In this connection,
                please read <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Coriolanus</span>. The impersonation of the feudal military spirit in the hero
                is perfect, and there are scenes—notably that of the conference between the
                tribunes when they plan "to darken him forever"—which are revelations. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have an article before the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Manhattan</span> which <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03297.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I now hope more
                than ever they will publish, for it has some things about Bacon I would like you to
                read. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> There is a noble picture of him, from the painting by Vandyck, in the October <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Harper</span>. Look at it, and ask yourself whether that face
                belongs to one who was "the meanest of mankind"! Nothing refutes a slander like a
                good portrait. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I have been over today to the Surgeon General's Office to see about data for you. I
                know Dr. Huntington, the Acting Surgeon General, very well. I am afraid that the
                quest will be fruitless. The only matter they have is the "Medical and Surgical
                History of the War", now in process of publication. What you want—i.e.
                hospital matter—will be in the third volume, and this is now being made up,
                and will not be ready, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03297.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03297.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> unfortunately, for a year. I am sorry. However, I will go down
                tomorrow, to the Medical Museum, and, (as Dr. Huntington suggested to me] talk with Dr.
                Wild, the librarian, and see if he can give me anything. I fear it is
                unlikely—the publications being inchoate. You shall hear duly. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am crushed with work at present. The weather is simply infernal. I wish you were
                better, and hope the coming coolness of October will revive you. More anon.</p>
