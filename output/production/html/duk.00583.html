                    Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
                    Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:

                    by the letter's "old mrs turner" died; Margaret Turner at 120 Portland Avenue

                        (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                        and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
                        more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."</p>

                        daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters
                        moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
                        position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment
                        that would lead to her death in February 1873. For more on Mattie, see
