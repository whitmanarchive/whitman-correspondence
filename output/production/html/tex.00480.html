                Y'r letter with the $203 65/100 f'm y'rself, the Misses Ford, 
                Wm Thompson &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs Roberts
                safely rec'd to-day—best thanks to all—&amp; love too—&amp; the
                special prayer that Bessie F's recovery may be good &amp; firm &amp; permanent—

                I am jogging along here undoubtedly on the downhill decline, but more comfortably than you might suppose—have
                 had a pretty good week, the past—have been out an hour or two even three or four, every day—a
                 friend sends a hansom &amp; I drive out—or at other times in my stout wheel 
                 chair—Not so well
                 to-day—cannot get out—have either caught fresh cold, or it is a whack of this infernal
                 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grip</span> wh' has settled on me of late months—Dr Bucke is here
                 temporarily—Harry Stafford has been ill, but was over it at last acc'ts—he
                 has given up telegraphing &amp; RRing—Best love to you all—
