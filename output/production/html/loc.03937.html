                    (1833–1910) was the mother of Harry Stafford (1858–1918), who, in
                    1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at the printing office of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden New Republic</span>. Whitman regularly visited the
                    Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey. Whitman enjoyed the
                    atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would often stay for weeks
                    at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln," which he delivered in New York
                    City on Thursday, April 14, 1887. He first delivered this lecture in New York in
                    1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over the succeeding years,
                    delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had published a version of
                    the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
