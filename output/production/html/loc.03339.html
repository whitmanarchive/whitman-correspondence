            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to have your postcard two or three days
                ago, &amp; to find that you still struggle on so bravely. When your card came, I was
                staying awhile at a pleasant farm near the little town of Brecon, whither I went for
                the Welsh Eisteddfod. (I send paper by this post, with article of mine giving brief
                description). Harvest was in full swing while I was there, and I had a capital time
                of it, riding<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03339.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03339.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03339.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> about on
                a sturdy &amp; quick little mare, &amp; getting well sun-burnt. My
                work—editing &amp;c., made me come away at last sooner than I wished to. I
                left there on Monday,—travelling by farmer's gig &amp; train, &amp; then afoot
                for twelve miles by a good country road through a quiet &amp; picturesque cwm or
                valley,—so reaching this place, Carmarthen, where I stay with my grandfather
                &amp; mother.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Wales has been at its best for the last three of four weeks—splendid harvest
                sunshine day after day; &amp; you may think of me, if you will, as living a free
                &amp; easy life in the sun, having for society the hearty &amp; simple farm folk of
                South Wales, listening with<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03339.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03339.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03339.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> immense zest to their folk-songs &amp; folk-tales, which are of a
                kind that you would like &amp; take to heart.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is great stone of the antique in Wales, as you know; &amp; it is good on these
                sunny autumn afternoons to climb up to some old castle, and imagine the Medieval
                bards &amp; warriors parading there as of old. I have been dipping more &amp; more
                into old Welsh romance &amp; poetry, of late; eking out with a dictionary my small
                store of the vernacular as now spoken. There is great wealth of metaphor, &amp;
                excessive metrical finesse in some of these old Welsh poets. Indeed, Welsh poetry is
                far more intricate &amp; distinctive in its way than the English, while of course<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03339.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03339.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03339.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> wanting in many things
                that the best Elizabethans had.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I expect to stay in this neighborhood for two or three weeks,—exploring some
                parts of the coast (for the sea is quite near.) &amp; of the country, that I have
                not already come to know. Little by little Wales is becoming a fairly well-known
                country &amp; fatherland, where many hospitable rooftrees serve as a kind of
                friendly barricade against the outer world—if it should be inclined to treat
                me badly at any time. Now defended from the sophistications of life, one can manage
                to live the spirit of "Leaves of Grass,"—a life simple &amp; healthy &amp;
                very human! But I must stop now, for the sun calls me out; &amp; I have already
                written much to-day.</p>
