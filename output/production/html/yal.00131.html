                He is likely the Hugh B. Thompson (b. 1840) who enlisted as a Union soldier in the U. S.
                Civil War in 1861. He began as a private in Company F of the 2nd Regiment, New York Heavy Artillery,
                and he was appointed Sergeant in 1863. In 1864, he was on daily duty as an Adjutant General's 
                Clerk, and was mustered out at the conclusion of his service in 1864, near Petersburg, Virginia.
                He likely met Whitman in Washington during the War. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n0819">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0819 note" id="n0819"><span>Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, a volume that consisted of fifty-three Civil War poems, was
                    published in 1865. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln occurred while <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> was being printed, and Whitman promptly added
                    the short poem "Hush'd be the Camps To-day," with a note about Lincoln's death
                    to the final signature of the book. Whitman then decided to stop the printing
                    and add a sequel to the book that would more fully take into account Lincoln's
                    death. Copies of the volume were withdrawn so that the sequel could be added.
                    Whitman hastily composed several poems, adding eighteen new poems to those that
                    appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, and all of these poems were
                    published in a second edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to Drum-Taps</span>
                    (1865–1866). Later, these poems were folded into <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves
                        of Grass</span>, and by the time the final arrangement of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was printed in 1881, the "Drum-Taps" cluster that
                    Whitman included in that volume contained forty-three poems. For more
