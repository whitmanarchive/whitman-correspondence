                    Whitman spent a "pleasant time at R. Pearsall Smith's and his wife Mrs Hannah W
                    Smith (&amp; dear daughter Mary) at 4653 Germantown avenue . . . the fine, long,
                    spirited drives along the Wissahickon, the rocks and banks, the hemlocks, Indian
                    Rock—Miss Willard, Miss Kate Sanborn, Lloyd Smith (R P's brother) the
                    librarian" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Feinberg Collection). Whitman was again
                    with the Smiths from December 30 to January 2 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Mary
                    Smith, a student at Smith College, forced her somewhat reluctant family to visit
                    the poet. Her father became very fond of Whitman, who, however, never "hitched"
                    with his wife, a famous Quaker leader (1832–1911). Hannah Smith was not
                    impressed with the poet's Hicksite leanings or his verse. Whitman was very fond
                    of the other two Smith children, Alys and Logan Pearsall (1865–1946).
                    Lloyd Smith (1822–1886) was a publisher and a librarian. See Logan
                    Pearsall Smith, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Unforgotten Years</span> (Boston: Little, Brown
                    and Company, 1939), 92–108, and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Religious Rebel: The

                    xvii–xviii. Whitman's visit to the Smith family is also discussed in Jon
