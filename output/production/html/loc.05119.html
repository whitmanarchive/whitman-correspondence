            <p class="tei_p">I wish you could send me, if you have them loose, a few of your
                portraits, especially of the shirt-sleeves one—or perhaps you could tell
                me where they are to be had, if they are attainable to the public? I should like
                also to have a couple of copies of a brief autobiographical note of which Edward
                    Dowden gave me a copy some time ago—intended to
                accompany presentation copies of the L. of G. I am just
                home from a summer's walking-tour in Switzerland, where I, and a friend who lives
                here, had a glorious time together. Anything more bracing and invigorating than the
                air on the high mountain passes it is impossible to conceive. We went over one
                glacier, where my friend distinguished himself by falling into a crevasse. As we
                were all roped together—two guides and ourselves, he was extricated without
                much damage. Scenery on the glacier the
                    'Tschingel' was marvellous. It is a vast lake of ice, probably some 200
                feet deep, lying <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01030_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                high among the peaks of the Bernese Oberland. It is mostly covered with a thin
                coating of snow, but at one point it pours down through a break in the
                mountain-wall, by a kind of gorge or ravine, into a deep valley. It has the
                aspect then of a river, not a lake; and at this point there is no snow—the
                ice being heaped up into enormous ridges &amp; pinnacles like a river when there is
                a long reach of rapids, only in the glacier everything is much vaster—the
                waves as big as a terrace of houses, with deep chasms between them walled as far as
                one can see with gleaming ice. The ice is only semitransparent &amp; is of a very
                strange pale green hue. The wild, tossing confusion of the ice-river
                contrasted strangely with the absolute stillness and immoveability, broken only, now
                &amp; then, when some great block would totter over and come thundering down into the
                valley, hurling huge fragments &amp; splinters into the air as if they were dust.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am working now at an essay on the L. of G. which I am to read before a literary
                society here. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01031_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01031_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01031_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>Shall introduce quotations liberally &amp; see what they think of my translation.
                If I like this essay when it is done I will publish it here in pamphlet form &amp;
                send it well about Germany. I suppose you got a page of
                translation I sent you some time ago?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope all is going well with you. Heard some months ago of an intended prosecution
                of the new edition—but I suppose that was a mere 'canard.'</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Much interest here about the English in Egypt. A shameful
                business altogether, which makes me thankful that I am not an Englishman except
                against my will. The other European governments feel some satisfaction at the course
                taken—whenever might is the order of the day despotism feels securer, &amp; they
                like to see England, the home of liberty, acting as unjustly as any dynasty with its
                traditions of iniquity. They do not yet fully comprehend that English liberty is
                regarded as being only fit for Englishmen.</p>
