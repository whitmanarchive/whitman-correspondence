                me where they are to be had, if they are attainable to the public? I should like
                also to have a couple of copies of a brief autobiographical note of which Edward
                    Dowden gave me a copy some time ago—intended to

                home from a summer's walking-tour in Switzerland, where I, and a friend who lives
                here, had a glorious time together. Anything more bracing and invigorating than the
                air on the high mountain passes it is impossible to conceive. We went over one
                glacier, where my friend distinguished himself by falling into a crevasse. As we
                were all roped together—two guides and ourselves, he was extricated without
                much damage. Scenery on the glacier the
                    'Tschingel' was marvellous. It is a vast lake of ice, probably some 200
                feet deep, lying <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01030_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01030_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01030_large.jpg</span>
                high among the peaks of the Bernese Oberland. It is mostly covered with a thin
                coating of snow, but at one point it pours down through a break in the
                mountain-wall, by a kind of gorge or ravine, into a deep valley. It has the
                aspect then of a river, not a lake; and at this point there is no snow—the
                ice being heaped up into enormous ridges &amp; pinnacles like a river when there is
                a long reach of rapids, only in the glacier everything is much vaster—the
                waves as big as a terrace of houses, with deep chasms between them walled as far as
                one can see with gleaming ice. The ice is only semitransparent &amp; is of a very
                strange pale green hue. The wild, tossing confusion of the ice-river
                contrasted strangely with the absolute stillness and immoveability, broken only, now
                &amp; then, when some great block would totter over and come thundering down into the
                valley, hurling huge fragments &amp; splinters into the air as if they were dust.</p>

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    taken in 1854 by Gabriel Harrison of Brooklyn. The picture, which is used again
                    in the second, sixth, and seventh editions, is probably the one to which

                    on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The

                    (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston gave a humorous account of the Dresden society in
                    "The Literarischer Verein of Augustusstadt," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Dublin
                        University Review</span>, 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
                    signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
                    criticism. Rolleston also commented on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
                    which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claimed that "Walt
                    Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
                    he was treated from a more exlusively philosophical point of view." After the
