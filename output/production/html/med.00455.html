      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have adopted your suggestion &amp; written (same mail with this) to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="William​ ">Wm.</span>​  Swinton, Ward, Dr. Seeger, Stedman, [J.]
        Miller, Mr. Jardine—I am entirely satisfied with your letter, (as with Buchanan's and Rossetti's action in London.) I am pleased well with what you write me in, &amp; are doing by, your letter . . . Things go on with me much
        the same as usual of late . . . When you see any thing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">notable</span> or pungent about me or my affairs,
        send it to me, as I neither see or hear much here.</p>
