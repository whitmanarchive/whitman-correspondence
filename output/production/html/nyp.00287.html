            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I only write to say that I have received your welcome letter of the 9th, from Jamestown—&amp; that—as Mrs. Paulina Davis has been here, &amp; has, in her own &amp; husband's behalf, 
                kindly invited me, &amp; indeed made the arrangements—I shall come on to Providence, 
                to-morrow, 15th—they to meet me at the depot, &amp; take me home as their guest—from whence I shall report to you, &amp; to Dr. &amp; Mrs. Channing forthwith—&amp; fulfil my promised visit to them also, before I return here—which will be about 21st or 22d.
            </p>
