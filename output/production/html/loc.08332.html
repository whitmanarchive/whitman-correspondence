                    Greenwood (1830–1909), an English journalist, was the paper's first
                    editor. One of the paper's most well-known editors and innovator in

                    paper until 1889. In the early 1890s, the paper was edited by the journalist and
                    biographer Sir Edward Tyas Cook (1857–1919). The paper published works by

                    Burroughs. Holmes remained ambivalent about Whitman's poetry. He married Amelia
                    Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later Supreme

                    (1819–1891) was an American critic, poet and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic</span>. One of Whitman's famous poetic contemporaries, Lowell
                    was committed to conventional poetic form, which was clearly at odds with
                    Whitman's more experimental form. Still, as editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, he published Whitman's "Bardic Symbols," probably at
                    Ralph Waldo Emerson's suggestion. Lowell later wrote a tribute to Abraham
                    Lincoln titled "Commemoration Ode," which has often, since its publication, been
                    contrasted with Whitman's own tribute, "O Captain! My Captain!" For further
