                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                        moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
                        position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie's throat ailment led to

                    suffering from a thumb infection. She wrote: "I am so anxious about my hand I

                    It pained me last night more than usual." Heyde described Hannah's hand as
                    follows: "Her hand is yet very distressing. Dr Thayer says that he cannot decide
                    how it will terminate. The finger next her thumb is perfectly torpid and half
