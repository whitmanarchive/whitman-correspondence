                Your new book
                "Specimen days" came to hand this
                morning Mother is delighted with 
                it and so am I. How prettily
                you have let the illustrations in,
                artistically done, and what a good
                thing it is to dispense with the
                photographic <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">change</span>. The picture
                of your father is jolly: and of 
                you holding the butterfly is original
                and nice. I like the title page,
                a return to your old style.
                What you say about Millet
                is very, particularly, interesting to me.
                I always wanted you to see Millets
                pictures only I had no idea it ever
                could be managed, he <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span> an artist
                of the first water. But there are
                indications I think that you will
                have a Millet of your own in America.
                The bits about the Creek are
                just delightful to my mind: you

                with the bumble-bee birds,
                clover &amp; all those lovely things
                at the Creek: I haven't had time to read it all yet.

                I suppose the wood at Glendale
                is developing a charm of its
                own, I liked it very much:
                although of course it is not so
                rich and varied as Kirkwood, the
                Creek certainly was unique, I
                have never seen anything like it.

                Mother is busy over her life
                of Mary Lamb—nearly
                finished. She is well I am
                thankful to say and so is Gracie,
                at this moment she is singing, her
                voice has improved wonderfully.
