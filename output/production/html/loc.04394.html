                    traveled to the United States, arriving at Philadelphia on September 8, 1891

                    by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had recently
                    returned from two months of travel in Europe, where he had spent time with
                    Johnston, Wallace, and the Bolton College group of English Whitman admirers.
                    Both Bucke and Wallace visited Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days
                    with the poet, Wallace returned with Bucke to London, Ontario, Canada, where he
                    met Bucke's family and friends. Wallace's account of his time with Whitman was
                    published—along with the Bolton physician John Johnston's account of his
                    own visit with the poet in the summer of 1890—in their memoir, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
