                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was Whitman's attempt to "celebrate in my own way, the modern engineering masterpieces
                    . . . the great modern material practical energy &amp; works," including
                    the completion of the Suez Canal (1869), the Union and Central Pacific transcontinental 
                    railroad (1869), and the completion of the Atlantic Cable (1866) (see Whitman's <a href="col.00002">April 22, 1870</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway). Although Whitman
                    submitted the poem to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Overland Monthly</span> on <a href="loc.01691">April 4, 1870</a>, it was rejected on <a href="loc.02301">April 13, 1870</a>, for being "too long and too

                    poem to an English journal. John Burroughs observed in the second edition of his
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as a Poet and Person</span> (1871),
                    123: "The manuscript of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Passage to India</span> was refused by
                    the monthly magazines successively in New York, Boston, San Francisco, and
                    London." The poem was eventually included in the final three editions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, published in 1871, 1881, and 1891.

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
