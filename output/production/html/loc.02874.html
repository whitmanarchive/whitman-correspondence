            <p class="tei_p">Glad am I when the time comes round for writing to you again—though I can't please myself 
                with my letters, poor little echoes that they are of the loving, hoping, far journeying thoughts 
                so busy within. It has been a happy time since I 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00176.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00176.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00176.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                received the paper with the joyful news you were back at Washington, well on 
                your way to recovery able partially to resume work—scenting from 
                afar the fresh breeze &amp; sunshine of perfect health—by this time, not from afar perhaps. 
                The thought of that makes dull days bright &amp; bright days glorious to me too.—I noted in 
                the New York Graphic that a new edition of Leaves of Grass was called for 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00177.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00177.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00177.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                —sign truly that America is not so very slowly &amp; now absorbing the precious food she 
                needs above all else? Perhaps dear Friend even during your lifetime will begin to come the "proof 
                you will alone accept,—that "your country absorb you as affectionately as you have absorbed 
                it." I have had two great pleasures since I last wrote you. One is that Herby 
                has read with a large measure of 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00172.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00172.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00172.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                responsive delight Leaves of Grass quite through, so that he now sees you with his own eyes 
                &amp; has in his heart the living growing germs of a loving admiration that will grow with his 
                growth &amp; strengthen every fibre of good in him—Also he read &amp; took much pride in 
                my "Letters" now shown him for the first time. Percy has had a 
                fortnight's holiday with us, and looks better 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00180.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00180.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00180.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                in health though still not altogether as I could wish. He says he is getting such good experience, he 
                would not care just yet to change his post even for better pay. Music is his greatest pleasure—he 
                seems to get more enjoyment out of that than out of literature, &amp; is acquiring some practical skill.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Today (Feb. 25th) is my birthday dearest Friend—a day my children always

                make very bright &amp; happy to me: and on it they make me promise to "do nothing but what I like 
                all day." So I shall spend it with you,—partly in finishing this letter, partly reading in 
                the book that is so dear to me—for that is indeed my soul coming into the presence of your 
                soul—filled by it with strength &amp; warmth &amp; joy.—In discouraged moods when 
                oppressed with the consciousness of my own limitations,

                failures, lack of many beautiful gifts, I say to myself "What sort of a bird with unfledged 
                wings are you that would mate with an eagle? Can your eyes look the sun in the face like his? 
                Can you sustain year long, lifelong flights upward? Can you nest in dizzy rocks overhanging 
                dark, tempestuous abysses? Is your heart like his, a great glowing sun of Love?" Then I answer 
                "Give me

                Time. I can bide my time,—a long long growing &amp; unfolding time. That he draws me with 
                such power, that my soul has found the meaning of itself in him—the object of all its deep, 
                deathless aspirations in comradeship with him, means, if life is not a mockery clean ended by 
                death, that the germs are in me, that through cleaving &amp; loving &amp; ever striving up &amp; 
                on I shall grow like him—like but different—the correlative—What his soul needs 
                &amp; desires;

                "And if when I reach America he is not so drawn towards me,—if seeing how often I disappoint 
                myself, needs must that he too is disappointed, still I can hold bravely, lovingly on to this 
                inextinguishable faith &amp; hope—with the added joy of his presence sometimes winning from 
                him more &amp; more a dear friendship yielding him some joy

                &amp; comfort—for he too turns with hope, with yearning towards me—bids me be 
                "satisfied &amp; at peace" So I am, so I will be my Darling. Surely surely, sooner or later 
                I shall justify that hope satisfy that yearning. This is what I say to myself &amp; to you 
                this 46th birthday Have I said it over &amp; over again? That

                is because it is the under current of my whole life.—The "Tribune" with Proctors Lecture on 
                the Sun (&amp; a great deal besides that interests me) came safe. A masterly 
                lecture. And two days ago came the Philadelphia paper with Prof. Morton's speech—deeply interesting. 
                And as I read these things, the feeling that they have come from, &amp; been read by you turns them
