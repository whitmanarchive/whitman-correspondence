                with my letters, poor little echoes that they are of the loving, hoping, far journeying thoughts

                The thought of that makes dull days bright &amp; bright days glorious to me too.—I noted in

                growth &amp; strengthen every fibre of good in him—Also he read &amp; took much pride in 
                my "Letters" now shown him for the first time. Percy<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">4</a> has had a

                    editorial in the same issue added biographical details, probably supplied by
