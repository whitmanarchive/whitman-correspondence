            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am down here at Kirkwood—Came down here some four days ago—am having a real hearty old-fashioned time, for me—Harry came up for me in the light wagon, the day but one after I was last at your house—a delightful ride down here—&amp; yesterday afternoon one of those nice long rambling drives with George Stafford, in the roomy old light wagon, (a good part of the road through the piney woods, which I always enjoy so much)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The weather has been &amp; is pleasant—a little cool to-day, but the sun shining out as I write—I was down by the creek most of the forenoon—&amp; shall go down for an hour again this evening—bright moonlight nights—I am quite happy here, for me—We live well, keep good wood fires—&amp; have plenty of chicken, eggs &amp; fresh pork (they kill a hog about every two or three weeks)—Mr Stafford is pretty well—he has been out all day with the team hauling marl—Mrs Stafford is well—Harry &amp; the rest ditto—Mrs Stafford thanks you kindly for the medicine—I don't know what day I shall come up—Love to you all—</p>
