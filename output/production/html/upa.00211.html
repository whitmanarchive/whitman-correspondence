                        1878</a>, Whitman arrived in Kirkwood on Saturday, February 16, and in his
                    Commonplace Book he mentioned his stay with the Staffords from "16th to 23d
                    inclusive" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Whitman was with Anne
                    Gilchrist on February 13, and George and Louisa dined with her on the following
                    day (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Susan Stafford had written on <a href="loc.03878">January 26</a>, urging that Whitman come to
                    Kirkwood. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
