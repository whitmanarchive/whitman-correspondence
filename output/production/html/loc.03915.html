            <p class="tei_p">I arrived here safely Saturday evening 6<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>. Have had
                quite a good time so far. Came direct to the asylum. Went on duty as turnkey Monday
                morning but will not remain here over six weeks or two months as the occupation is
                not pleasant. Cannot sleep at night there are so many unearthly noises and besides I
                want to get a position where I can make better wages. And as you know I am of a
                nervous temperament and the least scene shocks me.</p>

                in either of the cities. If you are not personally acquainted there give me letter to some
                of the newspaper men. It will carry lots of weight. You know how I have started. I
                want to make a lot somewhere. If I could only get in a telegraph office I would be

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
