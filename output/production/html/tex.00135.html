            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">It is with shame that I sit down to write you a few lines. I have neglected it so long I suppose you thought I had quit forgotten you, but I can asure you my Dear friend such is not the case. I have thought of you verry often. One reason that I have not writen before is I have been shifting about so much since I have been home that if I did write you I could scearcely tell where to have you direct to but now I believe I have got settled down for the winter. Samuel M Dyer that got a furlough at the same time I got mine is hear. I spoke to him about writing to you. he felt just as I did about [it]. it was so long since we had promissed to write that he felt ashamed to but I hop you will pardon our neglect, and if it complys with your will I should be very happy to keep up a coraspandenc</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now I will try and give you an account of my journy home Samuel M Dyer and myself started from Washington on the 28th day of July 3 oclock pm arrive in Baltimore about 5 pm there we seperated S.M. Dyer took the 9 pm train for Harrisburg I stayed in Baltimore until Thursday evening then took the 9 oclock train for Harrisburg arived at H. about 2 oclock the next morning changed cars there fore Pittsburg arrived there about noon I went to the Soldiers home and got my dinner and a verry good dinner it was to. I then took the 1-40 pm train I did not chang cars again until I got to Chicago Friday evening I got into a sleeping car at Crestline Ohio, arived at Chicago Saterday morning at 8-30. I then thought I would stop there and look up a cousin that I thought lived there, but I found he had left here about two months before that so in the evening I took the cars again and the next morning I arrived at my uncles at McFarland Station I stayd there two weeks, then started for another part to a place called Raymond. there I had a good time. last Friday I came and reported at this Hospital. I think I shall stay here all winter</p>
