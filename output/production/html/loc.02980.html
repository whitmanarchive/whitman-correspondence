            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thank you for papers sent, &amp; for all loving thought. I hope you are "holding your
                own."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I must have gained a little here, for I sleep more, and have a better appetite. I am
                going to be weighed, I weighed 95 the day before I left Washington.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02980.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02980.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02980.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I write now especially
                to tell you that I intend to leave here next Monday, Sept. 16, unless a storm should
                prevent. We have to go to Eastport 12 miles by wagon, &amp; then take steamer to
                Boston. If it is stormy, Mrs. Porter says we must take the next boat, that
                would be Sept. 18. Wednesday. But in any case after you get this letter, my

                care of my nephew in Boston which I will give in a separate slip. I shall make a few
                short stops with nieces &amp; others till I return home, &amp; as my nephew is a fixture, he will forward any thing to me
                wherever I am. I shall not go home till into October I think. We have had such a wet
                &amp; rainy summer there that I know I better wait a while. I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">dread</span>, dear Walt, I can't tell any<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02980.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02980.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02980.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> one how much I dread the going back
                home. I say <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">home</span>, but the sense of loneliness that
                overtakes me when I think of going is heart-sickening. And the uncertainty of all
                adds to it. If I were sure that I could make any arrangement to keep a home, I
                should feel better, but all is so cloudy &amp; misty. But I try to keep up a good
                heart, &amp; not to worry my friends with my troubles.</p>

                &amp; help me about disposing of William's papers &amp;c. He
                left all to me absolutely, but I should be so glad of help in many matters, &amp;
