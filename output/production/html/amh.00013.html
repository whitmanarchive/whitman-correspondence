                    of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
                    the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In December 1862, on
                    his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman
                    stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk in the
                    office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge helped Whitman gain employment in Hapgood's office.

                    Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

                    Whitman's replacement at the Attorney General's office, starting August 14, 1873
                    (see Whitman's <a href="nar.03602">letter</a> of introduction for Godey to
                    chief clerk Webster Elmes). Whitman subsequently sent payment for Godey's
                    service through Eldridge on <a href="nyu.00003">August 29, 1873</a>, and
                        <a href="prc.00029">September 29, 1873</a>. On <a href="loc.01757">October 31, 1873</a>, Whitman wrote Peter Doyle that "I got a letter from
                    Mr. Eldridge that he had paid Godey, my substitute, the money I sent on for his
                    October pay." It was clearly Whitman's routine to send Godey's money order on
                    the twenty-ninth of each month (see also Whitman's letter to Eldridge of <a href="med.00426">December 29, 1873</a>). Therefore, this (possibly
                    draft) letter would seem to date from either October or November 1873, as
                    Whitman's correspondence with Eldridge has also been lost for November. However,
                    his opinions of his health seem less optimistic during that month. Whitman's
                    letters in October routinely begin in the same way this fragment does: "I am
                    still doing as well as when I last wrote" on <a href="loc.01756">October 24,
                        1873</a>, and "My condition remains about the same" on <a href="loc.01757">October 31, 1873</a>. Thus it seems likely that a
                    version of this letter was sent around October 29, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
