                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Whitman wrote in a <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>, letter to
                    Peter Doyle. Johnston was a colonel in the Civil War, and Whitman often referred
                    to him in letters by his rank. He was a portrait and landscape painter who for
                    years maintained a studio in Philadelphia and lived at 434 Penn Street in
                    Camden. See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New-York Historical Society Dictionary of
