                <p class="tei_p">Very cold here. I am still about not much about for I can only move by
                help, but have the grip badly, &amp; bladder trouble. I often think of you &amp;
                hope you have comfortable times—I have heard you have a good kind
                attendant who has been there some time in the asylum—I wish he would
                stop here at 328 Mickle Street &amp; see me a few minutes when he is in Camden.

                    Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
                    mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death
                    in 1873. During his mother's final illness, George Whitman and his wife Louisa
                    Orr Haslam Whitman took over Eddy's care, with financial support from Walt
                    Whitman. In 1888, Eddy was moved to an asylum at Blackwood, New Jersey. For more

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    Education and as a member of the Board of Freeholders. In 1889, he was elected
                    superindendent of the County Insane Asylum in Blackwood, New Jersey. The
                    institution achieved such a high quality of care for its patients under Currie's
                    management that other institutions implemented his methods and rules. Currie
                    remained superintendent until his health forced him to resign his position in
