            <p class="tei_p">Was sorry—extremely sorry—to hear of your illness—trust you are
                well again by this time, (as fore-indicated by H[erbert]'s last)—all H's books for Mrs S[tafford] came safely—also letters &amp; p.o. order—rec'd the
                good, long, fine letter from B[eatrice]—The S's
                are all well as usual—I am getting along capitally for me this winter so
                far—have been &amp; am writing quite a deal <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">to order</span>
                (astonishing, isn't it?)—will surely send you when
                in print—I wish you would send the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cedar-Plums like</span> to Rossetti—(I suppose you rec'd it)—what
                silly fictitious items appear about me in some of the English papers—(about as
                bad as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span>)—trust you all had merry Christmas &amp;
                New Year's—Cold &amp; deep snow here—</p>
