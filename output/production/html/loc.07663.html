                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Froude's Carlyle to a man who needed cheering up. I read it a few years ago and
                    it nearly gave me an attack of melancholia. I look upon that same Carlyle as
                    being (or having been?) one of the worst 'Cranks' that ever lived. . . . I shall

                    Bucke that Whitman "looked bright &amp; cheerful and in good spirits." Bucke
                    continued in his letter of <a href="loc.07240">September 17, 1888</a>:
                    "Still it is grand to see you keep up as you do—never giving up to the

                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
