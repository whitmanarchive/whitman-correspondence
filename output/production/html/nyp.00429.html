            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I feel to write you a card, but I guess it will be a dry one, for I have nothing to
                write about, &amp; I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">havn't​ </span></span> got very smart yet—I go out though—(Seems to
                me if I couldn't go out in the sun &amp; open air I should give up
                entirely)—How did you make out with the piece for the Lyceum? I suppose you
                rec'd what I sent you—the extracts on poetry—did you make a piece <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">and
                read it</span> as I told you?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> (I'll bet five dollars you didn't
                do any thing of the kind)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd a pamphlet from Edward Carpenter to-day—his forthcoming lectures for
                1881—perhaps he sent you one—I have been in all day, occupying myself
                reading &amp; writing a little—Shall go out now for a couple of
                hours—There I told you this would be a dry letter—</p>
