            <p class="tei_p"> We returned from our wanderings last week. On the whole had a fairly good time. I had a good glimpse of a large
                section of the country. I spent 10 days in Washington, then went to Ky. where I stayed till 1st of
                June, &amp; joined wife &amp; Julian in Chicago June 5th. I found Wm O'Connor 
                better than I expected to; his mind <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01155.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01155.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01155.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> seems clear
                &amp; strong, &amp; his lameness not very bad. But there is probably little chance of his
                ever being any better. A sea voyage is the thing for him, but he will not go. He has
                probably got that horrible disease called <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">progressive locomotor
                    ataxia</span> I saw him several times at his office. He felt a little insecure in
                his place, but I don't believe he will be disturbed. Washington was very beautiful &amp; I was glad to be
                there again. My sleep was very poor while in Ky, but I think of it as the finest 
                country I have yet seen—that is the blue grass <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01155.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01155.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01155.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                region of it; much ahead of anything I saw in Ill. or 
                Ind. or Ohio. I went to St Louis, &amp; sailed from there up to Quincy on the Missippi. I was ten days in Chicago, the N.Y. of the west, &amp; destined to be an
                enormous city. We stopped at Cleveland with friends, then at Niagara &amp; at Utica.
                Julian saw many wonders &amp; got many ideas. I am very glad to be home again. It is
                getting to be a great bore for me to gad about to see things. I hope you are better
                than when I saw you. You should make a determined attempt to keep your bowells open.

                shudder when I remember what you said about their torpidity. I could not live a
                month so. Your head would be all right if you could keep your bowells open. Frank
                Baker said that an outward movement, such as chafing &amp; kneeding of them by the hands would be a great help. Why can you not have your boy
                do that for 1/2 hour each day, also drink a good deal of water. <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Hathern​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Hathorn​
        
      </span></span> Spring water from Saratoga would be good. Also a
                wet towel over the liver. Drop me a line how you are, &amp; if you have any plan to
                get away from C. for the summer. </p>
