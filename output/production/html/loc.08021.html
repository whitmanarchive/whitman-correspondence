                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-bye My Fancy</span> (1891), quoting from "L. of G.'s
                    Purport": "Well, the 'haughty song—before in ripened youth—never
                    even for one brief hour abandon'd,' is finished, and the singer soon
                    departs—and the present listeners soon depart. But the song remains and
                    will do its work—that same song is the most virile, potent and live thing
                    on this earth today—and the singer and the listeners they go the way
                    provided for them but they will not get out of the range of this prophetic
                    utterance." That Bucke was in part writing for posterity is evident from a
                    passage in his April 5, 1891, letter to Horace Traubel, "If you see my letter to
                    W. of 31st Mar kicking about save it or return it to me—W. refers to it in
                    card of 2d inst. and I may want it later" (The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                    the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
