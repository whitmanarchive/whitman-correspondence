            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of yesterday came this forenoon—that was a rather serious runaway 
                of cars in the tunnel a week ago—&amp; mighty lucky to get off as you all did—Pete I got a few lines from Parker Milburn—he told me you had a very bad 
                sore on a finger of right hand—they are plaguey bad things—I am in hopes yours will partly make up in giving you a little resting spell. 
                I sent you "the Children of the Abbey,"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> an old novel that used to be all the rage—did you get it? To-day here is a great turn out 
                &amp; dedication of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Masonic Temple</span> in Philadelphia—it is truly a handsome &amp; noble building. 
                A rain last night here, &amp; to-day is really perfect. The Camden free masons marched 
                by here this morning, about 250, the finest collection of men I thought I ever saw, 
                but poor music, all brass, a lot of fat young Dutchmen, blowing as if they would burst, 
                &amp; making a hell of a hullabaloo—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete I am about the same—may be a little improved in general strength—had bad spells a good deal all the earlier part of the week—some very bad—but feel better yesterday &amp; to-day—I am making some calculations of the cool weather—think it may be favorable to me—did not go out any yesterday—shall try to get out this afternoon a couple of hours—I don't know a soul here,—am entirely alone—sometimes sit alone &amp; think, for two hours on a stretch—have not formed a single acquaintance here, any ways intimate—My sister-in-law 
                is very kind in all housekeeping things, cooks what I want, has first-rate coffee 
                for me &amp; something nice in the morning, &amp; keeps me a good bed &amp; room—All of which 
                is very acceptable—(then, for a fellow of my size, the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">friendly presence 
                &amp; magnetism needed</span>, somehow, is not here—I do not run foul of any)—Still I generally keep up very good heart—still think I shall get well—When I have my bad spells, I wait for them to fade out—I have got a letter 
                from Charley Towner—I am finishing this by the open window—still in the rooms 
                where my mother died, with all the old familiar things—but all drawing 
                to a close, as the new house is done, &amp; I shall move on Monday.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
