                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">You will believe that I received with pride and warm feeling the
                love which you sent me in a letter to Gilchrist,<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">1</a> now published
                in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span>; and that I reciprocate your love with
                reverential affection.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">That movement for a few English people to express in a practical form the feeling
                which they entertain towards you has not as yet taken any extended
                development—nothing I believe having been done outside a few general
                paragraphs in journals. Gilchrist will now be taking steps in a more detailed and
                direct way: from him and his mother<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">3</a> you will no doubt hear many
                particulars from time to time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The sums which have as yet come into my hands as Treasurer are £22.2.6. I beg to
                forward this amount in the within form—being
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">1. 3 Post-Office orders which will be made good to you upon your signing them,
                    and presenting them at Camden—and</li><li class="tei_item">2. A Brank-draft which, as I am advised, you can get cashed in Camden or
                    Philadelphia.</li></ul>
            The draft comes from Charles Aldrich,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> of Webster City,
                Iowa, who had an interview with you some months ago, and wrote me several
                interesting details about it. Indeed Mr. Aldrich's letter was the immediate
                incentive and opportunity for Mrs. Gilchrist and the rest of us to bestir ourselves,
                and see who among us would honour himself by associating his name in this small way
                with yours.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a little list of names, and remain, like so many others who have hearts to
                feel and ears to hear,</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Your lifelong debtor,</span>

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
                    Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
                    Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man . . .
                    never satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>). Aldrich visited Whitman at his Camden home
                    numerous times, and he served as a conduit between the poet and William Michael
                    Rossetti in England, who edited the first British edition of Whitman's work. For
