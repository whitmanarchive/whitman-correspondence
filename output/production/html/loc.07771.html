                came to hand this a.m. The little piece to "The year '89"
                enclosed. It is fierce and strong, do not see where (in your condition) the force
                comes from to write such lines so savage and bitter with their double and treble
                    meaning. I trust you are (even if "very very
                slowly") gaining and am glad to have you say that you believe in my diagnosis of
                letter of 24<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> Dec. If you can only be sure and not take
                more than the system can day by day dispose of (and excrete the waste from), you may
                do pretty well for a long time. The fault is not that you eat too much—(I do
                not suppose you are inclined to eat more than would be good for you) but that your
                excretary organs (especially bowels &amp; kidneys) are in such poor trim. I note
                what you say of Sylvester Baxter's criticism in Boston Herald. He has not sent me a copy and I have not seen it
                yet—I hope either you or Traubel will send it me at once. The big book ought
                to be on the market. When will it be? Binding I suppose not settled upon yet?</p>

                school again. No winter yet, soft, dirty, muggy weather [/] All however goes quietly
