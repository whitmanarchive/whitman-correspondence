          <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir:</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter, referring me the ruling of the P. O. Dept. [as] to what the term 
        "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">book manuscripts</span>" as used in Sec. 244. Postal Laws and Reg. includes, and what 
        it excludes, makes me then respectfully request that, if convenient, that ruling 
        shall be brought up before the proper officers of the Dept, to be reconsidered 
        and reversed for the following briefly stated reasons:
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">1st the word "Book" as used in the statute is unquestionably the generic term "Book," 
        comprehensive of all printed literary matter, (see Webster's Unabridged Dict. last 
        ed. p. 151.) A pamphlet, monthly or weekly magazine, the "Living Age," the "Galaxy," 
        or any literary composition, or printed issue, or any collection of sheets of paper, 
        of literary character, or only two sheets, or one sheet—must, all &amp; several, 
        be included in the term.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">2d. The intention of Congress [&amp;] of its post office, &amp; other legislation<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> to foster literature, education, authorship, general reading, publication, &amp;c. 
        &amp; be liberal to the press: is well known to the Dept. I might claim therefore that 
        the section must be construed generously. But I merely claim that it be construed 
        according to the exact meaning &amp; definition of its own terminology—See the 
        Dictionaries<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—Webster—Book—a general name of every printed literary composition—The quest. a generic term—The question also is, Is a magazine—(i.e. a pamphlet)—a book—See dictionary—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pamphlet</span> . . . . . . . . 
        a small book—Worcester—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pamphlet</span>—a book consisting of only one or a few sheets stitched together, &amp; not bound—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I would respectfully apply a second time for a reconsideration &amp; reversal of the 
        ruling of the construction in your Dept. of that proviso of Sec. 244 of Postal 
        Laws, which fixes the postage on "book Manuscripts and corrected proofs passing 
        between authors &amp; publishers," at the rate of ordinary printed matter, which 
        ruling, as furnished me, is that MSS. and corrected proofs from or to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Magazines</span>, 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pamphlets</span>, literary <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">periodicals</span>, &amp;c. are 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> included in this proviso, but shall pay letter postage.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Against this I again offer as follows: The main question is, What is a book in 
        fact, and in the meaning of the law?—I say, in both, it is<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">In the ruling furnished me by the Department, stress is laid on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">distinction</span> 
        Congress makes (in the postage rate) between <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Books</span> and other printed matter, as 
        pamphlets, magazines, &amp; newspapers. So they do make such distinction, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">invariably 
        in order to decrease the rate of postage of the latter</span>.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">The inference is a fair one then that if book MSS go for printed matter postage, 
        the pamphlet and Magazine MSS should at least do so. The distinction is made for 
        the purpose of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">favoring</span> the periodical press. But it does not warrant any such 
        inference as in the ruling furnished.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">All <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">literary MSS</span>. are "book manuscripts," and when printed, they become "Books"—and the law covers <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> (literary matter)—To contend otherwise would be same as 
        to confine the meaning of the word <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">man</span> as used by metaphysicians and statesmen 
        (by Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence for instance,) to mean a full 
        grown <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">male person only</span>—while, of course, it is an ensemble and generic term, 
        for both sexes, and all ages.
      </p>
