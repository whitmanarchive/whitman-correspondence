                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1809–1892) succeeded William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain
                    in 1850. The intense male friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In
                        Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote after the death of his friend Arthur
                    Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's poetry. Tennyson began a
                    correspondence with Whitman on <a href="med.00410">July 12, 1871</a>.
                    Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman to visit England, Whitman
                    never acted on the offer. At the time Whitman wrote this letter, Bucke was
                    traveling abroad in England in an attempt to establish a foreign market for the
                    gas and fluid meter he was developing with his brother-in-law William Gurd.
                    While in England, Richard Maurice Bucke visited Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and Bucke
                    gave a detailed account of their meeting to Whitman in his letter to the poet of
