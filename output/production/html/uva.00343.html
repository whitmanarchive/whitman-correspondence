                    Jr.(1814–1875), was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp
                    most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan.
                    Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>
                    in 1858, was instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over
                    twenty items on Whitman appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> before the
                    periodical folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace
                    Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know
                    all about me." For more about Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel,

                    in the columns suggested by Whitman, two contributions of Henry P. Leland, which
                    had appeared earlier in the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">City Item</span>: a
                    poem entitled "Enfans de Soixante-Seize" and a swashbuckling tribute to "Walt
                    Whitman." Leland (1828-68) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Grey-Bay Mare,

                        of Copperheads</span> (Philadelphia: Frederick Leypoldt, 1863). Whitman spoke
                    many years later to Charles of Henry's support "in the darkest years of his
                    life"; see Elizabeth Robins Pennell, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Charles Godfrey
