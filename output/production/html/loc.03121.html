                given him the copy.—the immediately coming paper number for Feb: is all made
                up but this will be put in type for next &amp; proof sent to you—&amp; in due
                time some of the papers &amp; prob'y some printed slips (as I have stipulated for
                    some) The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Lippincott</span> for
                March will have a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">personal &amp; old age memoranda</span> article
                by me, &amp; a WW piece by HT—&amp; portrait (might be worse, not much
                either)—all that's the present program—the Feb: NA <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Rev.</span> (I suppose) will have a (funny?) article

                be?"—then the Youth's Companion (y'r city) has accepted &amp; handsomely paid
                for a wee little poem Ship Ahoy—So you see the crank is grinding away even in

                have been ten days &amp; nights—the main abatements &amp; dykes are shattered

                here in my room alone rather late—had my dinner, supper of a slice of toast
                &amp; cup of tea—quiet &amp; comfortable enough—good fire of oak
