            <p class="tei_p">Please accept these copies of my latest edition. Please have conveyed to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the lady</span> the set enclosed for her. John Burroughs
                sends second edition of his "Notes"—Your letter of 8th July has
                reached me—I hope to write you more fully &amp; answer it from Washington
                city—My address is still there—(&amp; always, always glad to hear from
                you, my friend.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still blest with the greatest health, &amp; have been enjoying this fine summer
                here exceedingly. My "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>" I consider
                substantially finished, as in the copies I send you. To 
                "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span>" it is my plan to add much, if I live. I have read
                carefully the article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster</span> If you learn for certain who wrote it, I
                should be glad to know—It is a profound &amp; eloquent essay—&amp; I am
                proud to be the subject of it—I have received much comfort from your
                country—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">here</span> little but refusal or coldness.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I conclude by sending best respects &amp; love. Indeed, my friend, I wish to hear
                from you oftener.
