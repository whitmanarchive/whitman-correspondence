            <p class="tei_p">I can send you more newspapers—and perhaps more books—in a few days, if you wish for another bundle. I have no copy of Jackwood, and could not get one here, or I would have sent it. A new edition will be out soon, when I will see that you get a copy. You will find in the package two copies of the Drummer Boy, one of which I wish you would leave at Mr. Chase's.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I got your letter yesterday. The day before I went to see your friend, Babbitt, whom I found apparently much improved, certainly brighter—perhaps he was getting better acquainted with me, and perhaps because his descriptive list had come, and he was expecting to be taken away yesterday by his friends; or it may be he is really better. He felt that the list came through your influence, and appeared very grateful to you for it.</p>

                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
                    gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry Boy and the
                        Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
                    had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the <a href="nar.00002">January 10,
                    1863</a>. Though
                    Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every
                    year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and
                    greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A.
                    Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>,
                    23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace

                    stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
                    D. O'Connor. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00321_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00321_n2"><span>Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber
                    (1814–1890) was a celebrated humorist and newspaperman. While he was with
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston Post</span>, he invented the American version of Mrs.

                    associated with Shillaber in the short-lived comic journal <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Carpet Bag</span>, in which appeared the first writings of Artemus Ward and
                    Mark Twain. Shillaber wrote to Whitman about Babbitt on December 14, 1863
