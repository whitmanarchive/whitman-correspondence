            <p class="tei_p">I have had the book a couple of days and have looked
                through it, I believe it will do, and if it will the
                Editor will deserve more credit than the Author—I
                am really surprised at the tact and judgement you have displayed in putting my rough
                M.S. into shape and I am more than satisfied with all you have done—I see now
                that you were right about the Latin motto (as about
                every thing else)—it is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> in line with the book
                and is better out of it. I should like to know who will be the English Pubr and when the book will be published in England and when here? I suppose

                    McKay will send me a statement (all in good time)
                showing my financial position as toward the vol.?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well here, the season is backward, the leaves not fully out yet; indeed
                the oaks and even some of the maples and elms have scarcely begun to come out
                yet—however the asylum grounds look lovely, we have had a great deal of rain
                and the grass and the young leaves are exquisitely fresh and green</p>
