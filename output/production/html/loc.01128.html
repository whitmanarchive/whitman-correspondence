            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am back only a few days from a 3 weeks trip to Canada. The morning after my return some wretch poisoned my dog &amp; the loss has quite up set me. I have not been my self since. Then I am out of sorts in body &amp; wife is away under the doctors care, so that I am not having a very good time. We traveled—Mr. Johns &amp; me—about 2300 miles, &amp; excepting a week spent in the woods

            north of Quebec, the trip was a good deal of a bore. We went by way of Boston &amp; I ran about there some, I called on <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Gurnsey​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Guernsey​
        
      </span></span> of the Boston Herald &amp; found him a very likable young man—in fact a thoroughly good fellow. He said he had written to you, but had rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> no reply yet. I told him you were probably away in the country. I liked the looks of Boston much. We poked about Cambridge some &amp; then went over to Concord &amp; passed a night there. I found Mr Sanborn &amp; was cordially rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>. I had seen him the day before in Boston. I like Sanborn all except his lofty coldness &amp; reserve. It seems to be the style out there to affect ignorance of every thing you are interested in

            He showed us the home &amp; some of the haunts of Thoreau, &amp; then his grave &amp; that of Hawthorne. He took me to see Alcott whom I liked. Alcott praised my Emerson piece, but Sanborn appeared not to know anything about my writings. We were at Alcotts only a few minutes. He spoke in a friendly way about you &amp;c. We passed <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">by</span> Emersons house &amp; I admired his wood pile, I did not feel like calling upon him of my own motion. Alcott said he was well. I liked Concord, but I don't see how any great thing can come out of that place.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I got the Library Table with Blood's sanguinary review of my book. It is very petty criticism &amp; I think I can stand it better than Blood can. He evidently

            wanted to pitch into my Eagle, but was afraid of the claws. I hope I shall see you soon, as I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> go to W. this month unless the heat is too oppressive. Write me how &amp; where you are.</p>
