            north of Quebec, the trip was a good deal of a bore. We went by way of Boston &amp; I ran about there some, I called on <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Gurnsey​ </span></span><a href="#n0836" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0836">2</a> of the Boston Herald &amp; found him a very likable young man—in fact a thoroughly good fellow. He said he had written to you, but had rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> no reply yet. I told him you were probably away in the country. I liked the looks of Boston much. We poked about Cambridge some &amp; then went over to Concord &amp; passed a night there. I found Mr Sanborn<a href="#n0915" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0915">3</a> &amp; was cordially rec<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>. I had seen him the day before in Boston. I like Sanborn all except his lofty coldness &amp; reserve.

            He showed us the home &amp; some of the haunts of Thoreau, &amp; then his grave &amp; that of Hawthorne. He took me to see Alcott<a href="#n0741" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0741">4</a> whom I liked. Alcott praised my Emerson piece, but Sanborn appeared not to know anything about my writings. We were at Alcotts only a few minutes. He spoke in a friendly way about you &amp;c. We passed <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">by</span> Emersons house &amp; I admired his wood pile, I did not feel like calling upon him of my own motion. Alcott said he was well. I liked Concord, but I don't see how any great thing can come out of that place.</p>

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He

                    his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
