            <p class="tei_p">Yours of May 23d has reach'd me here—I am unable to give you any information on the genealogic points you speak of—wish I could—I have an idea there are town records or documents at Huntington, that are accessible, &amp; that might throw light on the Van Wyck and Whitman families—I have seen such records alluded to, &amp; printed extracts from them—where they are, or what office, in Huntington I think, or who keeps them, I can not say—Yes I was born at West Hills—my father Walter Whitman—I trace the Whitmans there four generations—my grandmother (father's mother) was Hannah <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brush</span></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am here on a visit—go back, last of next week, to Camden New Jersey, my regular p o address.</p>
