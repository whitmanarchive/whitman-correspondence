            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall return to New York to-morrow, Thursday<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—leaving here at ½ past 12, noon, 
                and getting in N. Y. about 8—&amp; intend to go on to Washington on Monday next, 26th. 
                I have been at the Channings's—Jeannie is quite unwell—but bears it like the heroine she is—William O'Connor is there—I am now at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis's—Am treated with the 
                greatest hospitality &amp; courtesy every where. Yesterday Mr. Davis took me out riding—went down to Fields' Point, off the bay—&amp; thence to the domain &amp; factories 
                of the Spragues,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> &amp; so to Olneysville &amp;c &amp;c—as interesting a ride 
                &amp; exploration as I ever had in my life—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Mrs. Whitman<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—&amp; like her. We had yesterday here to dinner &amp; spend 
                the evening Nora Perry,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> Wm O'Connor, Dr. Channing, &amp;c—To-day Mrs. Davis had 
                intended to take me out riding, but it is threatening rain, wind east, &amp; skies dark—So it will have to be given up. I like Mr. Davis much. I am very glad I made 
                this jaunt &amp; visit—Love to you, Helen, Emily, &amp; all.

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
                    the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's Monthly</span> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
                    deeply." For more information on Whitman and Abby H.
