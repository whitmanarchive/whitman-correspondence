                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Abby,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall return to New York to-morrow, Thursday—leaving here at ½ past 12, noon, 
                and getting in N. Y. about 8—&amp; intend to go on to Washington on Monday next, 26th. 
                I have been at the Channings's—Jeannie is quite unwell—but bears it like the heroine she is—William O'Connor is there—I am now at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis's—Am treated with the 
                greatest hospitality &amp; courtesy every where. Yesterday Mr. Davis took me out riding—went down to Fields' Point, off the bay—&amp; thence to the domain &amp; factories 
                of the Spragues, &amp; so to Olneysville &amp;c &amp;c—as interesting a ride 
                &amp; exploration as I ever had in my life—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Mrs. Whitman—&amp; like her. We had yesterday here to dinner &amp; spend 
                the evening Nora Perry, Wm O'Connor, Dr. Channing, &amp;c—To-day Mrs. Davis had 
                intended to take me out riding, but it is threatening rain, wind east, &amp; skies dark—So it will have to be given up. I like Mr. Davis much. I am very glad I made 
                this jaunt &amp; visit—Love to you, Helen, Emily, &amp; all.
            </p>
