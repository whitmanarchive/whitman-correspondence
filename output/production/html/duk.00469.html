                    January 17, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the letter to the year 1866,
                    but Edwin Haviland Miller dated the letter January 17, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,

                    the date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, the letter dates to January 17, a
                    Thursday. January 17 fell on Wednesday in 1866 and on Thursday in 1867. Further,
                    the letter responds to Walt Whitman's news that Juliet Grayson has died (see his

                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was living at 840 Pacific Street near Prospect Park,
                    which covered over 500 acres in what is now the center of Brooklyn. The designer
                    for the park was Calvert Vaux (1724–1785), and the chief architect was
                    Frederick Law Olmsted (1822[?]–1893). Work began in 1859 and continued
                    after the interruption of the Civil War. In 1867, when this letter was written,
                    the realization of Vaux's design was nearly complete. The park stretched to the
                    city's eastern boundary is notable for its Long Meadow, "a classic passage of
                    pastoral scenery with gracefully modulated terrain of greensward, scattered
                    groves of trees, and indefinite boundaries that create a sense of unlimited
                    space" (Charles E. Beveridge, "Olmsted, Frederick Law," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American National Biography Online</span>). Joseph Phineas Davis, who shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, her son Edward, and
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's family, was an engineer at Prospect Park (see

                    Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
                    letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
                    disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
                    charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her

                    Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Hannah's husband, Charles Heyde, stated that he owed
                    &amp;500 on his house, and he acknowledged Walt's gift to Hannah: "Han has
                    received two parcels from Walt with two pairs of nice gloves; one 5 dollar
                    greenback; and numerous stampd envelopes with your address written upon them;

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a

                        February 1859, and they and two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa,
                        shared the Pacific Street house with Louisa and her son Edward. Jeff in 1866
                        was employed as an engineer at the Brooklyn Water Works, but his career had
                        stagnated and did not revive until he was offered the position of chief
                        engineer at the St. Louis Water Works in 1867. For a discussion of his
                        mental state during this period, which is discernible from phrases in Jeff's
                        own letters and informed also by Louisa's observations, see Dennis Berthold
