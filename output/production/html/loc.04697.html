            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was extremely pleased, last evening, to receive the copy of Ingersoll's<a href="#n0839" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0839">2</a> lecture<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> you were kind enough to
                send me, &amp; I thank you for it with all my heart.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have read it over tonight for the first time.—I was hardly prepossessed in
                its favour. I had previously known but little of Ingersoll. And I learned from
                    Carlyle,<a href="#n4301" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4301">4</a> long ago, to care little for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01088.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01088.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01088.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.01088.jpg</span> platform "oratory" as such, &amp; to
                consider the main question always (as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> do) "What does
                it amount to?" And the newspaper reports (necessarily brief &amp; imperfect) did not
                make it appear to amount to very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But the full report, as I read it, swept away all prepossession &amp; criticism,
                &amp; filled me with a great &amp; dilating joy. It is a great &amp; notable
                utterance—strong, manly brave &amp; free—worthy of its subject, &amp;
                worthy of a great American orator to an American audience.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I feel as though I should like to write to Ingersoll himself to thank him for it. And
                I rejoice, with all my heart, that at last <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> should have
                heard so strong a public declaration of the value of your work. Honour to Ingersoll

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
