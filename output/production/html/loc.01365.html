                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend</span> 
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am pretty fair in health &amp;c of late &amp; now—pleasant weather here for
                several weeks—rainy of late—Y'r nice letter from Switzerland came
                yesterday—one from your father also just rec'd, enclosing the J A Symonds' note in answer to Swinburne's
                article—(the article was not worth answering at all—I have not given it
                a thought)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dr Bucke has been here for five or six days—leaves
                to-night—he is well—hearty as ever &amp; much the same—he has (in
                London Canada) one of the plaster heads, &amp; is quite enthusiastic ab't it—I
                suppose the one I sent to y'r father has been rec'd before this—I think it had
                better be donated to the Kensington Museum, if they will accept it &amp; give it a
                fair place—Morse is still here (in Phila)—is at work on his statuette
                of President Cleveland—H Gilchrist is here—he is
                at this moment giving some final touches on his oil painting of me—I like
                it—Some think it too <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">tame</span>—you will doubtless
                see it, as G. leaves here (NY) on the 21st on the Germania—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Phila is all agog now &amp; for three days to come with the centennial of the
                Constitution (the idea is good, perhaps sublime, but the carrying out of it more or
                less tawdry &amp; vulgar)—I am sitting here in the great chair, down
                stairs—window open—big bunches of flowers on the sill—every thing
                all right—had toast &amp; a great mug of Whitman's chocolate &amp; hot milk
                (excellent) for my breakfast—Love to Alys, to the
                baby, &amp; to all—</p>
