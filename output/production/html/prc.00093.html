         <p class="tei_p">I think of wanting this<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> engraved (exactly this size, and
            general design) for a frontispiece for my next edition of "Leaves of Grass." Do you
            think it would make a good picture?—Would it suit you to do it for me? If yes what
            would be the price?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I shall be here for some two weeks

            New York, where we could meet &amp; talk it over—Bring this picture with you. I

                    (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
                    1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
                    others, wrote the "indispensable" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in
                        America</span> (1882), and edited <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poetry of America,
                        1776–1876</span> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
                    poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
                        1890—Recollections</span> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
                    in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
                        <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle): "I
                    liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
                    who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_prc.00093_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_genoways tei_note_type_editorial note" id="prc.00093_n1"><span>Though the copy Whitman
                    enclosed is now lost, this was no doubt a copy of the portrait Whitman later
                    identified as "Photograph'd from life, Washington, 1871, by G. C. Potter, and
                    drawn on wood by W. J. Linton" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, 1876,

                    missing, but apparently he asked for a large sum of money to do the engraving,
                    because on <a href="yal.00400">March 22, 1872</a>, Whitman replied: "I
                    have been delaying to write you about the portrait in answer—wanting <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> to do it—&amp; wanting, if I could arrange it,
                    to give you the full price—I will not have the job done by any
                    second-rater, &amp; have concluded to give it up for the present—unless it
                    could be done by you for $50." Linton agreed to the price. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
