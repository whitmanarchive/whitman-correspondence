            <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Linton,</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I think of wanting this engraved (exactly this size, and
            general design) for a frontispiece for my next edition of "Leaves of Grass." Do you
            think it would make a good picture?—Would it suit you to do it for me? If yes what
            would be the price? I shall be here for some two weeks
            yet—then to return to Washington—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">—Send me word by mail, &amp; if convenient appoint an hour, day, &amp; place in
            New York, where we could meet &amp; talk it over—Bring this picture with you. I
            will be there as you appoint.</p>
