                    almost 21 years &amp; paid rent enough to buy it twice over. How long I shall be here,
                    or what I am to do in the future is all a problem. I am sorry to tell you that after

                    since this illness began in 1884 his expenses have been enormous, &amp; the bills of
                    doctors, &amp;c. very heavy. He has also

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, (?) |

                    misdated this letter consistently for three days. July 7 fell on a Sunday, June
                    7 on a Friday. Mrs. O'Connor sent an eleven-page letter to Whitman on July 3,
                    1889 about which he expressed doubts to Traubel on July 6, 1889 as to sending it
                    to Bucke (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                        <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.91.html">Sunday, July 7, 1889</a>). But he did include O'Connor's letter as an
                    enclosure along with this letter to Bucke. For additional confirmation of the
                    date, see Traubel's account of the poet's activities from July 5 to 7 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whiman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.89.html">Friday, July 5, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.90.html">Saturday, July 6, 1889</a>). Whitman rightly foresaw that Bucke would
                    seize upon the following section in Mrs. O'Connor's letter: "I have had several
                    most <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">vivid</span> dreams of you, so distinct that all the next
                    day I felt as if I had been with you; &amp; I wonder whether my 'astral body'
                    went to you, or yours came to me. A day or two before William passed away he
                    awoke from a nap &amp; asked me 'if Walt had gone?' I said you had not been
                    here, but he repeated the question, &amp; then I said yes, you had gone." See
                    also the letter from Whitman to Bucke of <a href="loc.07676">July 13,

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
