It is truly Pecksniffian,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> and seems to have been written on all-fours. You will

                but no offer, which of course he couldn't well make, not knowing exactly how useful

                    (1839–1887) was a clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E.
                    Huntington Library, San Marino, California), Whitman called him "chief clerk." Ramsdell was the
                    Washington correspondent for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> and the
                    Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span>. On <a href="loc.01829">May 8,
                        1867</a>, Ramsdell reported the high praise that George Townsend, the
                    journalist (1841–1914), accorded to Whitman—"a stupendous
                    genius," "the song of a God." On <a href="loc.01830">July 17, 1867</a>, he
                    asked Whitman to do whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho,
                    against whom charges had been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward
                    Dexter Holbrook (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory.
                    Actually, on July 12, 1867, Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a
                    "Report on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Charges</span> submitted by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. E. D. Holbrook</span>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">against</span>

                    Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
                    in Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
                    Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but inscribed by Whitman, dated July 20,
                    1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
                    ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
                    presented." On <a href="loc.01832">July 22, 1867</a>, Ramsdell apologized
                    for his "aggressiveness." Judge Kelly wrote to Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867
                    (National Archives), and again on <a href="yal.00125">August 9, 1867</a>.
                    On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow
                    (1832–1896), Secretary of the Treasury, that Whitman "be appointed to a
                    position in the Treasury Department" (National Archives &amp; Records Administration, Washington, D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r0494">back</a>]</li><li id="n0700">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0700 note" id="n0700"><span>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    that George Washington Whitman was not well, but was still able to go to work;
                    she did not indicate the gravity of his illness. She was upset by all the
                    turmoil involved in Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's moving. Martha, Jeff's
                    wife, somewhat impulsively, sold all the furnishings "and spent the money as
                    fast as it came in for clothes to go in the country." Under the circumstances,
                    since the family desperately needed some one who could "take things coolly," it
                    is understandable that Walt Whitman decided to hurry to Brooklyn. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01820_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01820_n3"><span>Henry Stanley Allen

                    address. In 1864 O'Connor had suggested Carleton as the publisher of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>; see Trowbridge's <a href="loc.00875">February 12, 1864</a>, letter to Walt Whitman. In 1865, O'Connor proposed

                    Since O'Connor was not successful in either attempt, it is surprising that he
                    once again sought to interest Carleton in publication schemes. See also the introduction

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence

                    literary weekly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span> in 1858, was
                    instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over twenty items on
