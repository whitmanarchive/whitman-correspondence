            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 11th just rec'd—it is a fine bright morning, just the right
                temperature—I am feeling better to-day—freer (almost free) of the heavy
                congested condition (especially the head department) that has been upon me for
                nearly a week—Took a long drive yesterday &amp; have been living much on
                strawberries of late—Don't write much—just sold &amp; got the money
                for—&amp; it comes in good, I tell you—a poem to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincotts</span>—(Mr Walsh editor—friendly to me)—poem called
                "November Boughs," a cluster of sonnet-like bits, making one piece, in shape like
                "Fancies at Navesink"—that ("November Boughs") is the name, by the by, I think
                of giving my little book, I want to have out before '87 closes—shall probably
                print it here in Phila: myself—it will merely give the pieces I have uttered the last five
                years, in correct form, more permanent in book shape—probably nothing
                new—I see a piece in Saturday's June 11 N Y <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>
                that Boyle O'Reilly is treasurer of my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">summer
                    cottage fund</span>—(dear Boyle, if you see him say I sent my best love
                &amp; thanks)—I wish you fellows, Baxter, Mrs
                F[airchild], yourself &amp;c, to leave the selection, arrangement, disposal &amp;c
                of the cottage, (where, how, &amp;c) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">to me</span>—the whole
                thing is something I am making much reckoning of—more probably than you all
                are aware—the am't shall be put of course to that definite single purpose,
                &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">there</span> I shall probably mainly live the rest of my
                days—O how I want to get amid good air—the air is so tainted here, five
                or six months in the year, at best—As I write
                Herbert Gilchrist is here sketching in my portrait for an oil
                painting—I hear from Dr Bucke often—nothing now of
                late from O'Connor, who is still in So: Cal—My friend Pearsall Smith &amp; his daughter sailed for England in the Eider last
                Saturday—</p>
