                    (1842–1913), a Union Army veteran of the United States Civil War, ran a
                    grocery business in Camden, New Jersey, and also served on the Board of
                    Education and as a member of the Board of Freeholders. In 1889, he was elected
                    superindendent of the County Insane Asylum in Blackwood, New Jersey. The
                    institution achieved such a high quality of care for its patients under Currie's
                    management that other institutions implemented his methods and rules. Currie
                    remained superintendent until his health forced him to resign his position in
                    1910. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n0699">1. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0699 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0699"><span>Edward Whitman (1835–1892),
                    called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. He
                    required lifelong assistance for significant physical and mental disabilities,
                    and he remained in the care of his mother until her death. His brother George
                    Washington Whitman cared for him for most of the rest of his life, with
                    financial support from Walt Whitman. For more information on Eddy, see Randall
