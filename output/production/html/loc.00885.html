         <p class="tei_p">I adapt myself to each case, &amp; to [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">indecipherable</span>]—some need to be humored, some are rather out of their head—some merely want me to sit down [near] them, &amp; hold them by the hand—one will want a letter written to mother or father, (yesterd[ay] I wrote over a dozen letters)—some like to have me feed them (wounded perhaps in shoulder or wrist) perhaps a few bits of my peaches—some want a cooling drink, (I have some very nice syrups from raspberries &amp;c.)—others want writing paper, envelopes, a stamp, &amp;c.—I could fill a sheet with one day's items—I often go, just at dark, sometimes stay nearly all night—I like to go just before supper, carrying a pot or jar of something good &amp; go around with a spoon distributing a little here and there. Yet after all this succoring of the stomach (which is of course most welcome &amp; indispensable) I should say that I believe my profoundest help to these sick &amp; dying men is probably the soothing invigoration I steadily bear in mind, to infuse in them through affection, cheering love, &amp; the like, between them &amp; me. It has saved more than one life. There is a strange influence here. I have formed attachments here in hospital, that I shall keep to my dying day, &amp; they will the same, without doubt.
