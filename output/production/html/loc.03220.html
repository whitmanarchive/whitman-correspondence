                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    to the U.S. in 1864 and worked at several papers throughout his career,
                    including the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chicago Times</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chicago

                    traveled throughout the United States, and his journal documenting a trip

                    (1819–1861) was an English poet, perhaps best known as a secretarial
                    assistant to Florence Nightingale and the subject of Matthew Arnold's elegiac
                    poem, "Thyrsis." After graduating from Oxford University, Clough taught at Oriel
                    College but resigned in 1848 when he grew dissatisfied with the Church of
                    England and was unwilling to teach its doctrines. He later worked as an examiner
                    in the British Education Office and Nightingale's assistant, to whom he was
                    related by marriage. Clough's social circle included many literary figures, such
                    as Matthew Arnold, Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlysle, and Ralph Waldo Emerson.
                    Clough died in Italy after contracting malaria and is buried in Florence's
                    English Cemetery. The poem Latchford quotes in this letter appears in a
                    posthumous collection of Clough's work and was written in 1852 when he was
                    lecturing in Concord, Massachusetts, on invitation from Emerson (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span> [Cambridge: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1862], 66). For
