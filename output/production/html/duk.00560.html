            would only excite her and make
            her feel bad that i dident put 
            any faith in what he wrote
            they are very insulting

            came i wish han was something
            like young chappells wife

            deserved a better lot that her father

                of heavenly death it lays here on
            the table by my side i have read it
            over many times and have had one 
            person ask me to let her take it hom
            i said no i would rather not
            let it go out of my hands and
            am very glad i did so as you
            wish me to reserve it i felt as
            if i should preserve it for i liked
            it it was so solemn) i got your
            letter walter this day with 2 dol 
            i am feeling better to day my head
            dont pain me and have got rid
                of the dissiness i am glad to have
                george
             home on some accounts
            i have more work to doo but
            probably its best) i asked him
            about the lot in putman a
            he said
            his price was 1000 doll but if you
            would like to buy it you could
            have it for 700 that is what it cost
            him he was up there last sunday
            he said there was three houses on
            that side about 15 feet from the old
            shop three story frame houses very
            good all different as if they were
            built by the ones that would ocupy them
                and 6 acrost the street) george says
            with a high fence the side of the shop
            he dont think it would be so very bad
            i only wish we had a house on it
            it would be a home any how its
            astonishing how houses rents there
            was a place in clermont
            george 
            went to see about but it was taken
            the uper part 30 dol per month</p>
