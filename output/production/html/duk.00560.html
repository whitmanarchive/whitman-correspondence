                    31, 1869. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "31 march," and Richard

                    as Bucke indicated, with the publication of Walt Whitman's "Whispers of Heavenly
                    Death." Bucke's scholarly abbreviation "N.B." for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nota

                    copies of the poem to his mother Louisa Van Velsor Whitman almost immediately
                    upon receipt of the thirty copies that he had requested from the publisher (see

                    office of Edmund Routledge). Routledge is the London-based publisher that had
                    issued the set of poems during the previous October. This letter corresponds
                    with Walt's request and with Louisa's receipt of printed copies of "Whispers of

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
