                <span class="tei_salute">MY DEAREST FRIEND:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a lingering hope—till Herby went south again—that I should have a letter from you, in
                answer to mine, saying you were coming up see us here. In truth, it was a great
                disappointment to me, his going back to Philadelphia instead of your joining us, or him,
                either here or somewhere near to New York. I wonder where that North Amboyna is that
                you once mentioned to me—and what kind of a place it is. I have had a long,
                quiet time here, and have enjoyed it very much—never did I breathe such sweet,
                light, pure air as is always blowing freely over these rocky hills. Rocky as they
                are—and their sides &amp; ravines are strewn with huge boulders of every
                conceivable size &amp; shape—they nourish an abundant growth of woods,
                and I fancy the farmers here do a great deal better with their winter crops of
                lumber and bark and maple sugar than with their summer one of grain &amp; corn. I
                expect Herby has described our neighbours to you—specially Levi Bryant, the
                father of my hostess—a farmer who lives just opposite and has put such heart
                &amp; soul and muscle &amp; sinew into his farming that he has continued to win
                quite a handsome competence from this barren soil (it isn't muscle &amp; industry
                only that are wanted here—but pluck and endurance) hauling his timber
                up &amp; down over the snow &amp; through the drifts, along roads that are pretty
                nearly vertical. I am never tired of hearing his stories (nor he of telling them) of
                hairbreadth escapes for him &amp; his cattle—when the harness or the shafts
                have broken under the tremendous strain—&amp; nothing but coolness &amp;
                daring have got him or them out of it alive. Generally, as he sits talking, his
                little boy of eleven who bids fair to be like him and can now manage a team or a
                yoke of oxen as well as any man in the parish—and work almost as
                hard—sits close by him leaning his head on his father's shoulder or
                breast—for the rugged old fellow has a vein of great gentleness and
                affectionateness in him &amp; I notice the child nestles up to him always rather than
                to the mother—who is all the same a very kind, amiable, good mother. Then
                there are neighbours of another sort up at the "Centre"—Mr. Chadwick, &amp;c.,
                from New York, with whom I have pleasant chats daily when I trudge up to fetch my
                letters—now &amp; then I get a delightful drive or go on a blackberrying party
                with the folks round—I expect Giddy over to-day &amp; we shall remain
                here together for about a fortnight—then back to Round Hill—where
                I am to meet the Miss Chase whom you may remember taking tea with &amp;
                liking—then on to Boston to see dear Bee—&amp; then to New York,
                where we shall meet again at last, I hope ere long. Love to Mr. &amp; Mrs.
                Whitman—I enjoy her letters. Also to Hattie &amp; Jessie—who will hear
                from me by &amp; bye. With love to you, dear Friend.</p>
