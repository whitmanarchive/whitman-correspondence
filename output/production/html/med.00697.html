         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I have just been spending an hour looking over "The Future"—and the "Ireland"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> you sent me—&amp; stopping at certain pieces here &amp;
            there, &amp; reading them quite carefully, &amp; dwelling upon them. They touch me
            deeply—indeed more than anything of the kind had previously done—the
            undertone of anguish and despair—the Laocoön struggles, (apparently useless)
            under the tightening grip[p]ing folds of the serpent—the cries &amp; complaints
            &amp; remonstrances &amp; calls for help—somehow, in your verses, brought the
            fearful condition of the laboring millions not only of Ireland, Italy, Poland
            &amp;c—but all Europe—more vividly than ever yet, before me.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">And it is well for me to get such reminding's—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But my own vein is full of hope, promise, faith, certainty—I see how an
            American—I for instance—cannot perhaps realize the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">peoples​ </span></span> desperate
            condition over the major part of the world—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">—This point you have to-day brought up sharply before me.</p>

                    (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
                    1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
                    others, wrote the "indispensable" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in
                        America</span> (1882), and edited <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poetry of America,
                        1776–1876</span> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
                    poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
                        1890—Recollections</span> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
                    in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
                        <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle): "I
                    liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
                    who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00697_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_genoways tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00697_n1"><span>In addition to being a

                    by sending him a pair of poems for his perusal. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
