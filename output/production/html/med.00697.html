         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I have just been spending an hour looking over "The Future"—and the "Ireland" you sent me—&amp; stopping at certain pieces here &amp;
            there, &amp; reading them quite carefully, &amp; dwelling upon them. They touch me
            deeply—indeed more than anything of the kind had previously done—the
            undertone of anguish and despair—the Laocoön struggles, (apparently useless)
            under the tightening grip[p]ing folds of the serpent—the cries &amp; complaints
            &amp; remonstrances &amp; calls for help—somehow, in your verses, brought the
            fearful condition of the laboring millions not only of Ireland, Italy, Poland
            &amp;c—but all Europe—more vividly than ever yet, before me.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">And it is well for me to get such reminding's—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">But my own vein is full of hope, promise, faith, certainty—I see how an
            American—I for instance—cannot perhaps realize the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">peoples​ </span><span class="tei_corr">peoples'​
        
      </span></span> desperate
            condition over the major part of the world—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">—This point you have to-day brought up sharply before me.</p>
