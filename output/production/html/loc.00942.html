                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
                    1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
                    Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
                    Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
                    more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

                    way to visit his brother George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in
                    Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk in the
                    office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George had not
                    been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his home until
                    1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood,
                    the army paymaster. The identity of Mrs. Cooper is unclear. A Mrs. Cooper is
                    mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's letter of <a href="loc.00940">November 10, 1863</a>. This is undoubtedly the Hattie
                    B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H. B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an
                    undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting" to Whitman—"from one who has
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">heart</span>—but not the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">head</span>—of a poet, and consequently feels a sincere admiration and
                    reverence for those Gifted Mortals, who possess both" (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection). Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a different Mrs. Cooper on
                        <a href="loc.00569">March 27, 1860</a>; the Mrs. Cooper of Vaughan's
                    letters was the mother of his roommate Robert "Bob" Cooper after Vaughan left

                    an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's

                    Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of age). During the 1860s, Price
                    and her family, especially her daughter, Helen, were friends with Whitman and
                    with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860 the Price family began
                    to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in

                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
                    (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
                    partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
                    covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
                    powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York, Rowman
                    and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
                    translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
                    O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on <a href="med.00324">August 13,
                        1864</a>, that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
                    attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
                    pistol."
                    Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
                    phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
                    (3:79, 340). In the last volume of the Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in
                    the first category of his threefold evaluation of persons "mentioned in this
                    volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and "Blame." In his entry for April 18,
                    1864, the Count referred to Whitman as among "the most original and genuine
                    American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote (372–373), appended
                    September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had "shown himself to be
                    animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that would honor the most
                    fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised by Robert Penn Warren,
