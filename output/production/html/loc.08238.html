                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an eccentric lithographer and photographer who took at least nine pictures
                    of the grey-bearded Whitman in 1878. Besides Whitman, Sarony's clients included
                    well-known literary figures like Mark Twain and Oscar Wilde. One of the
                    trailblazers of modern celebrity culture, Sarony invited public figures to sit
                    for him and be included in his catalogues. Whitman enjoyed the experience,
                    writing Harry Stafford that he "had a real pleasant time" and calling the studio
                    a "great photographic establishment" (see his letter to Stafford of <a href="nyp.00407">July 6–7, 1878</a>). For more on Sarony, see Ed

                    requested a few lines of verse to accompany the photograph. In a lost letter, on
                    March 11, Whitman transcribed three lines from Section 16 of "Song of Myself,"
                    which appeared in facsimile (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg

                    figure—almost without question—in contemporary American literature"
                    (203). Minton, on <a href="loc.02343">April 2</a>, had also asked Whitman
                    to answer the question, "Why am I a bachelor?." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n3115">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3115 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3115"><span>Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
