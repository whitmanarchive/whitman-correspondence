            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter rec'd this morning, speaks of the mild weather there—but it has been &amp; remains 
                very cold here—so much so that I don't go around half as much as I would like. My cold hangs 
                on, though not so bad as at first. The state of the weather, &amp; my cold, &amp;c. have rather blocked 
                me from having my usual enjoyment here, so far—but I expect to make up for it by and by.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    (1829–1906), of Missouri, alleged that since the U.S. had violated its
                    neutrality in the 1870 war by selling arms to French agents, Germany could bring
                    claims for damages against the American government. Schurz's opponents charged
                    that he had falsified documents. The New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> on
                    February 23 declared: "Schurz was the greatest toady any President ever had
                    until he failed to get all the offices he wanted, and then he turned round and
                    became a 'patriot' and a 'reformer.'" </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
