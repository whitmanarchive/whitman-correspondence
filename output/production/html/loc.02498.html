                Today I have been pondering over the events of that ever memorable month of July 1890; beginning with
                the long sea voyage, during which you were so often the topic of talk on board &amp; you were my chief
                object of desire for so many days; thinking of the time when I sat for countless hours <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_quantity_2 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span> the
                ship's prow, facing America &amp; watching
                our steel Leviathan wedging her way thro' the green waters of the broad Atlantic, &amp; every moment
                bearing me nearer and nearer to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>; when, anchored in the Delaware I lay
                in my berth and

                were; when, next morning I ferried the River, booked at the West Jersey Hotel &amp; with a palpitating
                heart made my way to 328, Mickle St. &amp; was at length shewn up stairs by Warry,
                heard your welcoming words:—"Come in, doctor! Come right in!"
