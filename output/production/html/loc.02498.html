                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and

                    (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
                    Whitman. Wallace, along with Dr. John Johnston (1852–1927), a physician in
                    Bolton, founded the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston
                    and Wallace corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members
                    of the Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet
                    and published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace,

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as
                    "Good-Bye my Fancy 2d Annex" to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>

                    published before Whitman's death in March 1892. For more information see, Donald

                    article was a detailed account of Whitman's seventy-second (and last) birthday,
                    which was celebrated with friends at the poet's home on Mickle Street. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
