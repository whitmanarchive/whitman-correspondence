                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    Herbert Gilchrist; in the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Herbert's preface to his biography of his mother: "I do not know . . . that I

                    dear, dear friend, Anne Gilchrist." Apparently in a lost letter Herbert had
                    asked permission to include his mother's letters to the poet. See also Whitman's
                    letter to Herbert Gilchrist of <a href="upa.00083">September 14, 1886</a>.
                    Herbert's mother, Anne Burrows Gilchrist (1828–1885), was the author of
                    one of the first significant pieces of criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>, titled "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by

                    1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that
                    she had fallen in love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met
                    in 1876 when she moved to Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her
                    affection, although their friendship deepened after that meeting. For more
