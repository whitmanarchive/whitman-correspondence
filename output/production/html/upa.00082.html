               <p class="tei_p">Some of her most beautiful, characteristic, interesting and copious letters were written to her friend Walt
                    Whitman the American poet. I suggested to Mr. Whitman, the giving of these
                    letters or rather extracts from them, for publication in the present volume. But
                    the poet was not entirely favorable or willing. "I do not know," he says in a
                    late letter to me, "that I can furnish any good reason, but I feel to keep these
                       sweet utterances exclusively to myself.
                    But I cannot let your book go to press without at least saying—and wishing
                    it put on record—that among the perfect women I have known (and it has
                    been my unspeakably good fortune to have had the very best for mother, sisters
                    and friends) I have known none more perfect in every relation than my dear, dear
                    friend Anne Gilchrist."</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Herbert, I am sorry not to be able to
                    respond to your request for letters or the like
                    —Can't you bring in this ¶ somewhere in the book?</p>
