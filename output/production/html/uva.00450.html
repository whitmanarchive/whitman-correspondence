            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been out here 9 or 10 miles from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil.</span>​  City Hall all this month at a very secluded place—good quarters,
                very quiet—on a visit to an old Quaker friend—his large family are all
                away at Newport—he is absent all day down town at business—&amp; I have
                the whole premises, house, horse &amp; carriage when I want, large garden, library
                &amp;c to myself—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good grub</span>—with every afternoon a
                long &amp; delightful drive exploring this beautiful region for miles and miles,
                Chestnut Hill, Indian Rock, the whole Wissahickon area, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  (June, July, &amp;c) your and Alma's
                hospitable &amp; affectionate letters, invitations—&amp; I ought to be kicked
                for not answering them before—but "you know what a wretch I am about such
                things"—never mind, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I appreciate them
                gratefully</span>—I am well as usual this summer—nothing very new <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  my books or literary fortunes—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall make a permanent move from Camden before many months—as my brother's
                folks are <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  changing to new quarters at Burlington N J—&amp; I shall not
                accompany them—I don't know where I shall go.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What a glorious summer we have had!—Never one so fine, seems to
                me—Best love to you all—Specially Alma and Albert.</p>
