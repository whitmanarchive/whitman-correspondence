            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">How is this? I shd not have thought you cd have written so masterfully on so old a
                theme. You remind me of an incident: Dr Bucke &amp; the attendant
                doctor I
                were making the rounds when we came to a fellow who was 
                queried &amp; searchingly examined by those
                wonderful eyes of the doctor's (Bucke's). "Well," says, Doctor B. you are a pretty
                sane man for a lunatic." So you seem to me a pretty <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">live</span>
                man for a dying (?) man! Not a living man could have written more vigorously than
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span> (N. Am Article).</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Yes, wish we c<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> do honor to those glorious pumpkin pies. I like 'em hugely. 
                I can see that that Ingersoll episode has brightened your spirits
                amazingly. May you live long, as Jefferson says in "Rip." 
                You perhaps saw my ⅓ col. of Ingersoll's speech with remarks by me, in last Sat.'s Transcript—(p.
                2) great "'lection" times here. Busy times for printers &amp; editors.</p>
