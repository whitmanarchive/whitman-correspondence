            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received your papers and the slips with them some days ago and was much 
                pleased to hear from you although in an indirect way. I see by the papers you sent me that your 
                health is not very good and I assure you that I am very sorry to hear 
                it. I would like to know how you are situated whether there is any thing that I can do to contribute 
                to your comfort and Happiness. If there is I will do it if it is in my power.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My Wife is quite sick and has been for the past two weeks. The Children are all well as usual.</p>
