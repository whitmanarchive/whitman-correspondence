            <p class="tei_p">I received your papers and the slips with them some days ago and was much 
                pleased to hear from you although in an indirect way. I see by the papers you sent me that your 
                health is not very good<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> and I assure you that I am very sorry to hear 
                it. I would like to know how you are situated whether there is any thing that I can do to contribute 
                to your comfort and Happiness. If there is I will do it if it is in my power.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My Wife is quite sick and has been for the past two weeks. The Children are all well as usual.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a></p>

                    was the son of Henry Wilson (1805–1870)—a harness and trunk maker—and
                    Ann S. Williams Wilson (1809–1887). Benton Wilson was a U. S. Civil War soldier recovering in Armory Square Hospital 
                    in Washington, D.C., when he met Whitman. Later, Wilson was employed selling melodeons and sewing machines. He also
                    sold life insurance and may have worked as a pawnbroker. He married 
                    Nellie Gage Morrell Wilson (ca. 1841–1892). Nellie had two children, Lewis
                    and Eva Morrell, from a previous marriage, and she and Benton were the parents of five children.
                    Wilson named his first child "Walter Whitman Wilson," after the poet; their other
                    children were Austin, Irene, Georgie, and Kathleen Wilson. Benton Wilson's
                    correspondence with Whitman spanned a decade, lasting from 1865 to 1875. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00670_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00670_n2"><span>Whitman suffered a paralytic
