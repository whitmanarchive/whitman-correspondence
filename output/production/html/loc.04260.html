                <span class="tei_salute"/>Dear friends all</span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have come on some 200 miles further north &amp; west (from Niagara) and am now very
                pleasantly quartered in Sarnia, Canada West, at the house
                of Mr and Mrs Pardee. (Mr P is one of the Queen's big
                officers here, &amp; a tip-top fellow) I am writing this on Lake Huron. The weather
                is fine, &amp; the country looks first rate. Susan I take every thing very easy,
                &amp; so far I have felt unusually well &amp; comfortable in health. George you
                would be interested in the way they farm here, it is a noble farming country but
                very different from Jersey new, plenty of good wood, hard soil, rather
                wet.—wheat, grass, barley &amp;c mainly—not much corn &amp; hardly any
                rye—good for potatoes—all later<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00024_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00024_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00024_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>—I enclose
                you a letter I have written for the papers—George, Harry &amp; Mont, it will
                give you some idea of my goings about here—Susan I know you will be interested
                in it—(I shall send it you in a paper here, in about five days, &amp; then I
                want you to give it to Debby)—Harry, how are you getting along?—Edward
                Carpenter's address is 45 Brunswick Square, Brighton England—The waters here Lake Huron &amp; St Clair river are as fine as I ever saw,
                &amp; alive with steamers &amp; sail craft—Every body is kind &amp;
                hospitable wherever I go—to morrow forenoon I am to visit a Chippewa Indian
                village out a ways—&amp; in the evening a moonlight steamboat excursion up
                Lake Huron, they have prepared for us. I often think of you all. If any of you write,
                direct to me London, Ontario, Canada &amp; I will get it. (3 cent stamp only
                required) Harry you write, dear boy—I go back to London Thursday—</p>
