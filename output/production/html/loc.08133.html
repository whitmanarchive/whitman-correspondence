            <p class="tei_p">Your good long letter of March 30 and 31 came to hand last evening and would have been answered before now (7 p.m.) but work
                has been more than ordinarily pressing. I am greatly pleased to hear of even the most remote "indications of better" and trust
                they will increase. From all I can make out D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Longaker is a mighty level headed fellow and is likely to do well for you. 
                Your package containing "Munyon" and "Youths Comp" with the little poems 
                (one in facsimile) came today and was welcome. I have (of course) the Atlantic (take it) with O'C.'s 
                "Android"—the more I see 
                &amp; know of O'C. the more I regret he did not fulfill his original intention of following literature as a profession—what 
                a proud row of books we might have had from him on our shelves today! 
                All goes quietly and well here including the meter—</p>
