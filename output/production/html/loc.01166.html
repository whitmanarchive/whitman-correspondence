            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting here in my bark-covered study this bright sharp day, writing you this
                note. I look from the open fire that burns in the chimney, &amp; the wood of which I
                cut &amp; hauled up the hill myself, out of the window on to the river just covered
                with new ice, on off over the brown gray landscape. I am feeling well, better than
                one year <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01166.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> ago
                this time, my summers work I think has put something into me I much needed. I am
                still busy nearly every day in the open air. There is no snow &amp; the ground for the
                past few days has been like iron. As soon as the snow comes we shall probably go to
                Po'Keepsie to board a while. Julian says he rather stay here, &amp; he likes the
                country, &amp; likes the school here. He learns well &amp; begins to read books on
                his own hook. The other
                day at the close of the term of school he read his first composition in public. It
                was a real piece. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01166.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> It was about "Papas Dogs" &amp; gave much amusement. He spoke a couple of pieces
                also, &amp; easily carried off the honors. He is now reading "Tom Brown at Rugby." I
                trust, dear Walt, you are better than when you wrote a couple of weeks ago, &amp;
                that you will have a fairly good Christmas. If you are not in the mood to write me
                yourself ask Horace Trauble to drop me a 
                card. Nothing notable comes to or happens to me. I read a
                little, write none at all, go nowhere, &amp; try to make the most of the <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_rf tei_unclear_cert_low">prose</span> of life. If I could
                only continue my farm work or else hibernate like a woodchuck <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01166.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I should be glad. If you have any
                late news from O'Connor please let me have it. With much love
                &amp; a merry Christmas to you I am</p>
