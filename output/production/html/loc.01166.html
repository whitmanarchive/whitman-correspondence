                note. I look from the open fire that burns in the chimney, &amp; the wood of which I
                cut &amp; hauled up the hill myself, out of the window on to the river just covered
                with new ice, on off over the brown gray landscape. I am feeling well, better than

                this time, my summers work I think has put something into me I much needed. I am
                still busy nearly every day in the open air. There is no snow &amp; the ground for the
                past few days has been like iron. As soon as the snow comes we shall probably go to
                Po'Keepsie to board a while. Julian<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> says he rather stay here, &amp; he likes the
                country, &amp; likes the school here. He learns well &amp; begins to read books on
                his own hook. The other
                day at the close of the term of school he read his first composition in public. It
                was a real piece. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01166.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01166.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01166.003_large.jpg</span> It was about "Papas Dogs" &amp; gave much amusement.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
