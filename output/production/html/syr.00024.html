            </span>
 
            <p class="tei_p"> I got your letter of April 12, and since, your postal cards of April 19 and 26
                    respectively. Also the envelope containing
                    Kennedy's admirable review of the Longfellow memoir. I have
                been proposing to write to you every day, but it is not easy, I am so poorly. My
                lameness is very bad, and I am very exhausted before many hours pass each day. I
                have piles of unanswered letters. My special trouble now is what they call <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">schlerosis</span>—an induration of the lower part of the
                spinal <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00085.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00085.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00085.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> cord, a bequest
                of the inflammation caused by the nervous prostration. This it is which makes me so
                lame and strengthless, and unless the doctor can break it up (he is using
                electricity) the result, he tells me, will be paralysis. However, this is some way
                off, and I'm not dead yet! </p> 
            <p class="tei_p"> John Burroughs has been here, and gives me an account of your
                health, which makes me feel very badly. He told me
                especially of the trouble I share with you—constipation; and this you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> not, Walt, allow to continue. The very worst aperient
                you could use will do you <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00086.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00086.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00086.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> less harm than constipation. But there are aperients which are harmless, or
                almost nearly so, and I send you a packet of one which answers this description. It
                is known as Liquorice Powder, and is excellent. The dose is one teaspoonful in, say,
                a half goblet of water, when going to bed, to be taken when necessary. You will find it
                easy and excellent. It is composed only of powdered liquorice and sulpher, and is
                really without bad effect. Please try it. I have never been troubled with
                costiveness in all my life, but now, like yourself, I have a <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00087.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00087.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00087.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> partial paralysis of the bowels, and
                must, under medical orders, resort to artificial means, and this is my remedy.
                Anything is better than constipation. The physical feelings it induces are dreadful,
                to say nothing of the constant danger to life. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I was delighted beyond measure at the success of your lecture. I wish I could have
                been there. The account in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Press</span> was splendid. Great are Talcott Williams and Thomas Donaldson, and
                blessed be their names. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I had a letter from Dr. Bucke at London. He seems to be having a good time. </p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00088.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00088.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00088.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am glad you liked the little book. If I could only have written it over, I would
                have made it fuller and better. But when the time came for publishing, I was too ill
                to write.—I am obliged to you for the notice in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">North
                    American</span> (G.E.M.). It lets out the delicious fact that White had seen the
                article—probably some magazine that had it, broke faith, and showed it to
                him—and so he got a full excoriation before crossing Styx, for after he died, I
                took out the severest parts from the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">MS</span>. Big rascal! He
                well <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00089.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00089.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00089.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> knew the baseness
                of his attack on the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Promus</span> book. I have the best of reasons for believing that he
                was secretly a Baconian, but with his editions of Shakespeare, etc., at stake, the
                balance was on the other side of the ledger for him. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am much grieved to learn that Mrs. Pott is seriously ill. Nervous prostration.
                Between her tremendous labors on the Bacon subject, her large household duties, and
                her ministrations among the London poor, she has broken down. I feel very anxious
                about her. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> Donnelly's boom increases. There is an article in the 19th Century Magazine on his
                cipher, which will make an excitement and greatly raise his credit. He writes me
                that he expects to be ready to publish by June. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> We have had strange weather here. Cold and hot by turns, and rain without stint. Did
                you see the electric storm on Saturday night? I never witnessed such magnificent
