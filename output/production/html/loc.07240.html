                mislaid. I came across it by accident today. I am rejoiced to hear that the German L.

                sort of horror of "trimmed" books. Well enough for dictionaries, text books, &amp;c.

                you often feel bad enough and I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> you are very sick, worse luck. Still it is grand to see you keep up as you
                do—never giving up to the last—I think it is immense, something for us

                The meter<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> is still creeping on—slow and sure—no hitch of any kind yet
                and all looking well. We have had another charming day here—perfect autumn
                weather. I have been all afternoon in court giving evidence in an insanity case</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
