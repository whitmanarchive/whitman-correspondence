            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 10th with enclosures came during my absence in Sarnia and was stupidly
                mislaid. I came across it by accident today. I am rejoiced to hear that the German L.
                of G. is at last seeing the light—I shall look out for an early copy of it. As
                soon as you know the publisher's <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">name</span> &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">city</span> tell me then I can tell my English bookseller to look
                out for it for me. Am glad to hear that "N.B." will be "entirely untrimmed" I have
                sort of horror of "trimmed" books. Well enough for dictionaries, text books, &amp;c.
                but literature should have uncut edges. I had a letter from Ingram today dated 14th he says "I was up in W.W.s room last
                week—I could see no <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00361.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00361.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00361.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> change in him, he looked bright &amp; cheerful and in good spirits" This reads
                mighty well and I am glad enough to get such news—nevertheless I do not doubt
                you often feel bad enough and I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> you are very sick, worse luck. Still it is grand to see you keep up as you
                do—never giving up to the last—I think it is immense, something for us
                all to be proud of and to take to heart—and the world <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">will</span> take all this to heart one day—and will be the better for it.
                The meter is still creeping on—slow and sure—no hitch of any kind yet
                and all looking well. We have had another charming day here—perfect autumn
                weather. I have been all afternoon in court giving evidence in an insanity case</p>
