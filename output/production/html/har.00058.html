            retrograded any, nor had any more of the very bad spells like those in the early part of

            pretty good—I have sent you the Graphic, with piece by me, about the Capitol,
            which I suppose you rec'd—also same paper with my portrait &amp; criticism by

            return last Tuesday—I have written a couple of new poems, which I have sold to a
            magazine &amp; got the money for—I think one will appear in January number—I
            will leave you to guess the magazine—How are you getting along? How is
            'Sula?—Love to both of you—I am writing this up in my room—it is

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
