         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I am still here, &amp; still very much the same as when I last wrote you—have not
            retrograded any, nor had any more of the very bad spells like those in the early part of
            October—bodily strength is certainly better—<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> so easily tire, &amp; give out—locomotion still very bad—&amp;
            head not <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">out of the woods</span> yet—but spirits &amp; feelings
            pretty good—I have sent you the Graphic, with piece by me, about the Capitol,
            which I suppose you rec'd—also same paper with my portrait &amp; criticism by
               "Matador"—I have rec'd a letter lately from
            Eldridge—nothing new at Washington, in my affairs—Mrs. O'Connor was to
            return last Tuesday—I have written a couple of new poems, which I have sold to a
            magazine &amp; got the money for—I think one will appear in January number—I
            will leave you to guess the magazine—How are you getting along? How is
            'Sula?—Love to both of you—I am writing this up in my room—it is
            growing dark—I am going out to tea, to an acquaintance here—</p>
