            <p class="tei_p">Sarrazin's book (from him from Paris) has come, &amp; looks wonderfully inviting all through but is of
                course sealed to me—I enclose a slip of title
                detailedly, as you may want to get one from New York—(but of course you can
                have my copy as much as you want)—I have written to Knortz (540 East 155th St New York)—&amp; a card
                acknowledging reception to S, Paris—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Fine &amp; sunny here—am rather heavy-headed—&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hefty</span> anyhow to-day—nothing specially to particularize—ate my
                breakfast, (mutton broth &amp; Graham bread with some stew'd apple,) with ab't usual
                zest—(nothing at all sharp, but will do, &amp; even thankful it's as well as
                it is)—The "Literary News" (N Y) book &amp;c monthly, May, has a good two page
                biography &amp; notice—wh' I send (or will send soon)—Did you get a
                letter in wh' I asked you to write out &amp; enclose in my letter for Dr Brown,
                (apothecary here) a proper calomel powder prescription a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">little stronger</span> (if you thought right)—did you get the
                letter?—Did you send your WW book to Sarrazin?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Fine &amp; sunny to-day—feeling fairly—all going smoothly—In
                general ab't the world, I guess we are now floating on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">dead
                    water</span> in literature, politics, theology, even science—resting on our
                oars &amp;c. &amp;c.—criticising, resuming—at any rate <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">chattering</span> a good deal (of course the simmering, gestation, &amp;c.
                &amp;c. are going on just the same)—but a sort of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lull</span>—a good coming summer to you &amp; Mrs. B &amp; all of
                you—</p>
