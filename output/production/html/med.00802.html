                    (1857–1946) was born in Staffordshire and took classes in literature at
                    London University College. After her 1882 marriage to the minister George W.
                    Tooley, she pursued a career in journalism. She authored numerous biographical
                    sketches and earned a reputation as a talented interviewer who spoke to and
                    wrote about women working in an array of fields, including several women writers
                    and activists. She contributed to fin-de-siècle periodicals such as the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Woman's Signal</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Woman at Home</span>,
                    and she is the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life of Florence Nightingale</span>
                    (1905) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The History of Nursing in the British Empire </span>
                    (1906), among other works (Terri Doughty, "Representing the Professional Woman:
                    The Celebrity Interviewing of Sarah Tooley," in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Women in

                    on the verso of a letter that reads: ". . . copyright in that country. | May I
                    trouble you for an early reply? I am sorry that there is no way by which I can
                    forward postage for your letter. | Yours truly | Sarah A. Tooley | Messrs Osgood
                    &amp; Co." Since Walt Whitman's letter is not clearly connected to the fragment
                    of Sarah Tooley's, it is impossible to be certain that she was the recipient.
                    Miller proposes this fragment of Tooley's letter was written in September or
                    October 1881 when Whitman was discussing the copyright of the Osgood edition of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> (see Standish James O'Grady's letter
                    to Whitman of <a href="loc.03386">October 5, 1881</a>). There are at least
                    two possible explanations: Whitman wrote a draft, an unusual procedure for such
                    a trivial matter, or he wrote a reply on a piece of paper he found in the
                    ever-present litter in his "den." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
