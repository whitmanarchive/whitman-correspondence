                do not see why you should not go on for quite a while and have a middling good time
                especially when the pleasant weather comes. I feel more and more that you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> get out in the spring and that the new leaves &amp;
                flowers will be your best medicine. Ed Carpenter's<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">2</a> piece is
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good</span>,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> I have written him a
                line. I have still only looked into Sarrazin's<a href="#n3115" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3115">4</a> piece. Am fairly
                stuck fast for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">time</span> to do anything since the fire.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> I will

                again—we shall see.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a> It seems as if the fire and

                another week. [W]e have set now 18<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst. for our trip
                East. I trust it will not be delayed beyond that date. I am more than ever anxious
                to get on with the meter now as Traubel<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">9</a> is out of a job and I
                want the meter to furnish him one [—] I have every confidence that it will do
                so. [—] We have glorious sleighing here now and I am enjoying it greatly, I
                get out every day about 4.30 till 6. and sometimes (in the way of business) get
                other drives. Today is charming [.] I should like to be out the whole of it! but I
                am on duty—no clergiman this morning so I had to preach! I am supposed to know
                every thing and do every thing and I just put a good face on it and get through the
                best I can.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
