            <p class="tei_p">Your last letter, dear Walt, that of 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> of January, is very cheering, it has quite set me up, and really I
                do not see why you should not go on for quite a while and have a middling good time
                especially when the pleasant weather comes. I feel more and more that you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> get out in the spring and that the new leaves &amp;
                flowers will be your best medicine. Ed Carpenter's piece is
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good</span>, I have written him a
                line. I have still only looked into Sarrazin's piece. Am fairly
                stuck fast for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">time</span> to do anything since the fire. I will
                gladly make an abstract of Sarrazin's piece but want to see Kennedy's and if that is sufficient there is no need of me doing it over
                again—we shall see. It seems as if the fire and
                matters arrising out of it will keep Gurd and self back still
                another week. [W]e have set now 18<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> inst. for our trip
                East. I trust it will not be delayed beyond that date. I am more than ever anxious
                to get on with the meter now as Traubel is out of a job and I
                want the meter to furnish him one [—] I have every confidence that it will do
                so. [—] We have glorious sleighing here now and I am enjoying it greatly, I
                get out every day about 4.30 till 6. and sometimes (in the way of business) get
                other drives. Today is charming [.] I should like to be out the whole of it! but I
                am on duty—no clergiman this morning so I had to preach! I am supposed to know
                every thing and do every thing and I just put a good face on it and get through the
                best I can.</p>
