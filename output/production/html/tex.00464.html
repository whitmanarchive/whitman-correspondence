                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">During the past day or two I have been arranging your portraits for the 'Scottish Art
                Review' (where they will probably appear in the May number), and at the same time I
                have been reading <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">November Boughs</span> with great
                delight—Mrs. Costelloe's copy of the book! There
                is a double stimulus in your poems &amp; prose writings, now that I am able to read
                between the lines, feeling all the time as if I can still see you in your great
                arm-chair—as during my visits a year ago,—a never failing friendly
                presence behind the black-&amp;-white of the printed page. It is this impression that I
                must try to convey as far as may be in my article in the S. A. Review accompanying
                the portraits. —I wonder by the way whether Gilchrist
                would allow me to reproduce the photo. from his painting at the same time. Perhaps
                you will say a word to him about this?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Since coming back to London from my pleasant jaunt in South Wales—when I had a
                capital time of it in exploring Worm's Head &amp; the Gower coast,— <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00013.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex_ao.00013.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00013.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>I have been grinding
                away pretty hard at mere literary work—more than I like indeed, for I want to
                be less &amp; less literary in the narrow sense henceforth, &amp; go in for expressing life
                direct rather than dealing with other people's books. This is a lesson of course
                that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of Grass</span> teach me. So my instinct for life &amp; the
                open road grows stronger every day. "Right Jack Health!" as Keats said,—Health
                before everything!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Living in London need not mean any excess of mere <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">literariness</span>, however. There's no such place for Life after all. Even New
                York has not such tumult—such human interplay &amp; variety. Everyday something
                new &amp; inspiring discovers itself in the familiar ways. This struck me in walking
                along the Embankment from Westminster to Waterloo Bridges this afternoon with the
                tide—higher than usual—just at the full; the river alive with various
                craft. The sight would have pleased you well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I believe I told you that my sister Edith was with me here. She is going in for
                music, &amp; at this moment is thundering away at Wagner's 'Flying Dutchman' on the
                piano. We called on Mrs. Costelloe the other day, &amp; found her very well. Edith quite
                fell in love with her.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Getting dusk as I finish this just in time for post. Hope you are feeling better
                every way. Edith sends her love. Mine goes without saying. Remember me to all good friends.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer"> 
                <span class="tei_salute">always affectionately</span>
