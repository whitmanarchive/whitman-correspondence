                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">During the past day or two I have been arranging your portraits for the 'Scottish Art
                Review' (where they will probably appear in the May number), and at the same time I
                have been reading <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">November Boughs</span><a href="#n3999" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3999">1</a> with great
                delight—Mrs. Costelloe's<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> copy of the book! There
                is a double stimulus in your poems &amp; prose writings, now that I am able to read
                between the lines, feeling all the time as if I can still see you in your great
                arm-chair—as during my visits a year ago,—a never failing friendly
                presence behind the black-&amp;-white of the printed page. It is this impression that I
                must try to convey as far as may be in my article in the S. A. Review accompanying
                the portraits. —I wonder by the way whether Gilchrist<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">3</a>
                would allow me to reproduce the photo. from his painting at the same time. Perhaps
                you will say a word to him about this?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Since coming back to London from my pleasant jaunt in South Wales—when I had a
                capital time of it in exploring Worm's Head &amp; the Gower coast,— <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00013.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex_ao.00013.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex_ao.00013.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">tex_ao.00013.jpg</span>I have been grinding
                away pretty hard at mere literary work—more than I like indeed, for I want to
                be less &amp; less literary in the narrow sense henceforth, &amp; go in for expressing life
                direct rather than dealing with other people's books. This is a lesson of course
                that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">L. of Grass</span> teach me. So my instinct for life &amp; the
                open road grows stronger every day. "Right Jack Health!" as Keats said,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a>—Health
                before everything!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Living in London need not mean any excess of mere <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">literariness</span>, however. There's no such place for Life after all. Even New
                York has not such tumult—such human interplay &amp; variety. Everyday something
                new &amp; inspiring discovers itself in the familiar ways. This struck me in walking
                along the Embankment from Westminster to Waterloo Bridges this afternoon with the
                tide—higher than usual—just at the full; the river alive with various
                craft. The sight would have pleased you well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I believe I told you that my sister Edith<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">5</a> was with me here. She is going in for
                music, &amp; at this moment is thundering away at Wagner's 'Flying Dutchman' on the
                piano. We called on Mrs. Costelloe the other day, &amp; found her very well. Edith quite
                fell in love with her.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Getting dusk as I finish this just in time for post. Hope you are feeling better
                every way. Edith sends her love. Mine goes without saying. Remember me to all good friends.</p>
