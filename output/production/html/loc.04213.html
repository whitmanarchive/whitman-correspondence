                <span class="tei_salute">My Dearest Friend:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Welcome was your postcard announcing recovered health<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> &amp; return to Camden! May this find you safe there, well &amp; hearty, able to go freely to &amp; fro on the ferries &amp; streets. I wish one of those old red Market Ferry cars were going to land you at our door once more! What you would have to tell us of western scenes &amp; life! What teas &amp; what evenings we would have—you would certainly have to say "there is a point beyond which"—&amp; would have pretty late trips back of moonlight. Strange episode in my life! so unlike what went before &amp; what comes after—those evenings in Philadelphia—yet so natural, familiar, dear! If I were American-born, I certainly should not want to change it for any country in the world, and if as you have dreamed—as I too have dreamed—it is given us hereafter to have another spell of life on this old earth, may my lot be cast there when the great time dimly preparing is actually come. But meanwhile, dear Friend, my work lies here: innumerable are the ties that bind us. And I can only hope &amp; dream that you will come &amp; stay with us awhile when we have a home of our own. That dear little grandson<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">3</a> stayed with me two months till I really didn't know how to part with him, &amp; grew more &amp; more engaging &amp; pretty in his ways every day—rapid indeed is the opening of the little bud at that age—between 1 &amp; 3—&amp; the way he had of looking up &amp; giving you little kisses of his own accord would win anybody's heart. Bee's<a href="#n0260" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0260">4</a> letters continue as cheery as ever—she is heartily enjoying work &amp; life, and accomplishing the purpose she has set her heart upon, &amp; the people she is with are so good and kindly, it is quite a home. She is working a good deal with the microscope. Her outdoor recreation is skating. Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">5</a> is getting on very nicely. He has had a commission to make some designs for a new kind of painted tapestry—and his figures "Audrey &amp; Touchstone" are very much admired &amp; have been bought by a rich American, &amp; he has a commission for more. But the summer work he has set his heart upon is a portrait of you from all the material he brought with him—the many attempts he made there—handled with his present improved skill with the brush. I hope you will be able by &amp; bye to send him the photograph he asked for—but no hurry. Edward Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">6</a> came up from Sheffield and spent an evening with us—which we all heartily enjoyed—he is a dear fellow. We talked much of you. He has been giving lectures this winter on the Lives of the Great Discoverers in Science. Carpenter knows intimately, goes freely among, a greater range &amp; variety of men than any Englishman I know—he has a way of making himself thoroughly welcome by the firesides of mechanics &amp; factory workers—his own kith &amp; kin are aristocratic.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">7</a> is taking singing lessons again, &amp; hoping by the time you next see her to be able to contribute her share of the evening's pleasure. Percy<a href="#n2000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2000">8</a> is still working away indomitably at the "process," which is gaining ground rapidly on the continent, &amp; I hope I may say slowly &amp; surely in England. I see the Gilders now &amp; then—indeed they are coming up to lunch with us to-morrow—Mr. Gilder<a href="#n0871" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0871">9</a> is the better for rest—&amp; they seem to enjoy England; but England has done her very worst in the way of climate ever since they have been here. O I do long for a little American sunshine. We met Henry James at the Conways last Sunday &amp; found him one of the pleasantest of talkers. Rossetti<a href="#n0522" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0522">10</a> &amp; all your friends are well. Please give my love to your brothers &amp; sister. Were Jessie<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">11</a> &amp; Hattie<a href="#n0911" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0911">12</a> at home in St. Louis, I wonder, when you were there? Love from us all.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
