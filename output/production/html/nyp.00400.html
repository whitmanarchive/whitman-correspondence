                    a Pennsylvania native, was a Union solder during the U. S. Civil War. He served in 
                    the Sixth Ohio Cavalry, was wounded in the left shoulder, and, according to Whitman's
                    "Notebook: September–October, 1863" (Charles
                    E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
                    of Congress, Washington, D.C.), "came in frozen" from a "cav[alry] fight." 
                    According to Wintersteen's service records and his records from an Ohio National
                    Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers, he suffered a gun shot wound in
                    the left side of his chest in 1863, in Culpeper, Virginia, during the Battle of Culpeper
                    Court House. In his hospital notes, Whitman termed
                    him "a noble sized young fellow" (Charles I. Glicksberg, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman and the Civil War</span> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania
                    Press, 1933], 150), and referred to him briefly in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                        Days</span> as "Manvill Winterstein" (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1882–1883, 77).
                    In 1875 Whitman wrote to Wintersteen, who, on <a href="nyp.00399">March 1</a>, replied: "I can not place
                    you as I did not learn your name but havent forgot the kindness I recived while
                    in the Arm[or]y Square Hospital." On <a href="nyp.00400">March 10</a> of the same year, Wintersteen acknowledged
                    receipt of Whitman's picture, and on <a href="nyp.00401">August 8</a> described his not-so-prosperous
                    circumstances. Whitman's letters to Wintersteen have not yet been located. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n5002d">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_xml:id_n5002d tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n5002d"><span>This letter has not been

                    most frequently visited in Washington, D.C., during the Civil War. Because of
                    Armory Square's location near a steamboat landing and railroad, it received the
                    bulk of serious casualties from Virginia battlefields. At the end of the war, it
                    recorded the highest number of deaths among Washington hospitals. See Martin G.
