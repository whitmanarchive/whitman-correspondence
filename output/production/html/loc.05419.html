            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday, Thursday, I was to see Eddie—I 
                had to take a carriage, as the cars did not run to suit me. I would have had to stay there a long time, 
                five or six hours or else reach home very late. I found Eddie very well—he said he would like to 
                see you. He looked very neat and nice about his person—he has lost nearly all his teeth, and that 
                makes him look a little different. I left him comfortable in regard to clothes. I had a letter from 
                Jessie yesterday also—she returned from Memphis May 1st, enjoyed her visit, 
                and I think her letter was more cheerful. She said that she had not heard from you for a long time. I 
                have had three letters from C. Heyde—nothing new. (The party he spoke

                the last day of April and I gave Hannah a slight outline of the day they were only 
                here about three hours and I thought it might please Hannah to tell her about it! This was the party. 
                Sunday I suppose you will have some sort of a meeting of old friends to remember your birthday—I 
                hope you may have a good time. I enclose this <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aja tei_unclear_cert_medium">hdk</span>—the only thing I have by me—Geo
