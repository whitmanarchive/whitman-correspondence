                    Philadelphia PA | Mar | 12 | 5 PM. C. H. Sholes was a shorthand reporter in
                    Iowa. On Decoration Day, May 30, 1880, he published an article entitled "Ashes
                    of Soldiers" in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Iowa State Register</span>, commending
                    Whitman for his service during the Civil War. See Ted Genoways, "'Ashes of
                    Soldiers': Walt Whitman and C. H. Sholes, a New Letter and a Newspaper Article,"

                    for sale in the early 2000s by D &amp; D Galleries of Somerville, New Jersey,
                    with the inscription: "C. H. Sholes | from the author"—but if he sent a
                    postcard confirming the shipment, Whitman did not note it in the
