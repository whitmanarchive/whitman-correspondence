            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Here I sit again by the heater in the parlor, writing my weekly letter—I have just had my dinner, some cold turkey &amp; glass of Missouri wine &amp;c.—had been out to the P.O. some five or six squares distant—but have to take my time—Am still getting along very satisfactorily (for I am now satisfied with things not 
                being <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very</span> bad with me)—&amp; my strength is undoubtedly better, which, I hope
                will in time bring improvement in my walking, &amp; in my head, &amp;c &amp;c—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—The letter you spoke of about Penn. av. in the paper was not by me—In the Graphic of Tuesday last, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Nov.</span>​  25, they print a portrait of my beautiful phiz.

                in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash</span>​ —I have not rec'd any.—Also Monday's, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Nov.</span>​  24, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Graphic</span> prints my letter 
                about the Capitol—Your letter came Tuesday—As I said before, you seem to have done what was unavoidable 
                in the Rives muss—but I have a horror of bar room fracases &amp; fights—&amp; I know you have too—As a general thing, I don't think it necessary to resent 
                the insults of drunkards or fools, (unless there is something unavoidable in the case)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Did you get the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Scottish Chiefs</span> I sent? Good bye, my dear, loving boy—I am doing quite well—I hope this will find you feeling well in health &amp; jolly in spirits.
