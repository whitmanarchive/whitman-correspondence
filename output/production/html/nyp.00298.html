                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I will just write you a line to let you know I am here in Brooklyn, &amp; well &amp;
                hearty. Mother is well as usual, &amp; sends love to you &amp; William, &amp; to
                Jeannie. My sister Martha at St. Louis was not in good health at last accounts.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Helen Price was here &amp; spent part of the day—She is looking
                finely—they are all as usual—it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">was</span> John
                    Arnold<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> that died—he was a complete
                wreck—death was a boon &amp; relief in the case—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have heard from Mrs. Howells<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—I have seen Beulah,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> she is a fine young woman, a handsome
                healthy blonde—she is at the fine establishment of Wilcox &amp; Gibbs,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> on Broadway—her sister Lou is married—I shall soon see Mrs.
                Howells, &amp; then I will tell you further—Beulah asked much about you &amp;
                William, and Jeannie—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special with me or my affairs. As it turns out, my death by railroad smash
                permeated the lower orders, (I suppose at second &amp; third hand) &amp; the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">rectification</span> in many cases never reached them. So I hardly
                stir out in New York, but what I am called upon to certify, &amp;c.—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am daily on the water here—it is inspiriting, &amp; surpassingly
                beautiful—Every fine day the bay swarms with yachts, large &amp;
                small—they are literally in scores—I never tire of looking on
                them—All the young fellows yacht here—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear William, how are you? and dear Charles Eldridge, how are you? My true love to
                you both—Jeannie, my darling, a kiss for you—good bye, Nelly
                dear—</p>
