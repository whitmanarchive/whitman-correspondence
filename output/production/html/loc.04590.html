                <span class="tei_salute">My Dear Walt Whitman—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have got up very early this morning, expressly to write you, knowing I should have 
                no other chance to-day; but the getting-up, of itself, is unusually remunerative—for, 
                if the sun of America &amp; righteousness streams into your window at this moment, as 
                it does into mine, you will feel glad that you have lived to see another May. The 
                papers tell me more or less about you, and I often think of you—be sure—&amp; 
                most certainly about lilac- and Lincoln-time. However, you have not been 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">off</span> my perturbed mind for many months; nor has the treasured book 
                of "Camden's compliments"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> been off my table. Traubel<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">3</a> 
                sent it to me; I know I have not thanked him—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you must do it for me, most 
                heartily</span>. Moreover, the Brinton-Davidson "Bruno"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> came, and 
                nothing is ever more grateful to me than to receive a bit of your strong handwriting, like that 
                on its wrapper,—a "personally remembered," as it were. The truth, at last, is that I had 
                purposed to go down to Camden (for the first time) &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">see you</span> this 
                last winter, &amp; so have not written you. ('Tis a trip I shall yet make, D. V.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a>—to use the 
                protestant adjuration). But I have had a bad time, with much trouble about money—owing to 
                neglect to earn it while engrossed with driving through the "Lib. Amer. Literature," and then with 
                my beautiful mother's<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> death, my reckless 
                son's<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> divorce, and other Orestean cumulations of trouble. 
                At last the clouds are lifting, &amp; I am trying to get into routine &amp; self-poise.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Everything is all right in the world, of course, for both you and me. What particularly draws me to 
                you, as we grow older and more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">general</span>, is that your optimism strengthens 
                my own. Your later poems on life, death, immortality, are of the highest worth to me. I read them 
                often, and intend to refer considerably to them in my Johns Hopkins lectures on poetry<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">8</a>—which 
                I am now beginning to prepare. In tone, rhythm, feeling, breadth &amp; depth of thought, they seem 
                to me at the apex of your life-works—they reach in the Empyrean.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You know I am one of those who have the privilege of sharing my scrip with you, my dear elder 
                bard, when there is anything in it, and now, for the first time in months I have paid up my borrowed 
                money, &amp; have something that is my own to share. I wish the little enclosure<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">9</a> were more—and 
                I want to say that, the very next time you find your own scrip empty, Traubel must again 
                give <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span> a chance with the rest of your devoted friends.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pray don't feel moved to acknolwedge this tardy letter</span>. I should 
                feel miserable to add the grasshopper that is a burden to one's afternoon of life. 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">My</span> table is covered with letters I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">can't</span> 
                get time &amp; strength to answer. When telepathy can take the place of manual writing, we 
                shall be blessed indeed.—I miss O'Connor.<a href="#n2002" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2002">10</a> Was fortunate in having

                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
                    as correspondent of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York World</span> from 1860 to 1862.
                    In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
                    until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
                    next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
                    and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poets of America</span>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    Davidson (1840–1900), a Scottish philosopher and author. It included a

                    the poet with Bruno in his rejection of the "Christian notion of sin as a
                    positive entity" (34). On April 4, 1890, Whitman sent copies of the book to John
                    Addington Symonds, Alfred Lord Tennyson, Gabriel Sarrazin, T. H. Rolleston, and

                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
