                <span class="tei_salute">My Dear Walt Whitman—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have got up very early this morning, expressly to write you, knowing I should have 
                no other chance to-day; but the getting-up, of itself, is unusually remunerative—for, 
                if the sun of America &amp; righteousness streams into your window at this moment, as 
                it does into mine, you will feel glad that you have lived to see another May. The 
                papers tell me more or less about you, and I often think of you—be sure—&amp; 
                most certainly about lilac- and Lincoln-time. However, you have not been 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">off</span> my perturbed mind for many months; nor has the treasured book 
                of "Camden's compliments" been off my table. Traubel 
                sent it to me; I know I have not thanked him—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you must do it for me, most 
                heartily</span>. Moreover, the Brinton-Davidson "Bruno" came, and 
                nothing is ever more grateful to me than to receive a bit of your strong handwriting, like that 
                on its wrapper,—a "personally remembered," as it were. The truth, at last, is that I had 
                purposed to go down to Camden (for the first time) &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">see you</span> this 
                last winter, &amp; so have not written you. ('Tis a trip I shall yet make, D. V.—to use the 
                protestant adjuration). But I have had a bad time, with much trouble about money—owing to 
                neglect to earn it while engrossed with driving through the "Lib. Amer. Literature," and then with 
                my beautiful mother's death, my reckless 
                son's divorce, and other Orestean cumulations of trouble. 
                At last the clouds are lifting, &amp; I am trying to get into routine &amp; self-poise.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Everything is all right in the world, of course, for both you and me. What particularly draws me to 
                you, as we grow older and more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">general</span>, is that your optimism strengthens 
                my own. Your later poems on life, death, immortality, are of the highest worth to me. I read them 
                often, and intend to refer considerably to them in my Johns Hopkins lectures on poetry—which 
                I am now beginning to prepare. In tone, rhythm, feeling, breadth &amp; depth of thought, they seem 
                to me at the apex of your life-works—they reach in the Empyrean.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You know I am one of those who have the privilege of sharing my scrip with you, my dear elder 
                bard, when there is anything in it, and now, for the first time in months I have paid up my borrowed 
                money, &amp; have something that is my own to share. I wish the little enclosure were more—and 
                I want to say that, the very next time you find your own scrip empty, Traubel must again 
                give <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span> a chance with the rest of your devoted friends.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pray don't feel moved to acknolwedge this tardy letter</span>. I should 
                feel miserable to add the grasshopper that is a burden to one's afternoon of life. 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">My</span> table is covered with letters I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">can't</span> 
                get time &amp; strength to answer. When telepathy can take the place of manual writing, we 
                shall be blessed indeed.—I miss O'Connor. Was fortunate in having 
                an evening with him, in Washington, before he passed away. His widow is 
                thinking of a memoir, or memorial volume. Forgive this long, yet hasty, letter. 
                Vol. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">XI</span> (&amp; last!) of the "Library" will soon be out; &amp; I 
                am, with increased honor &amp; affection</p>    
            <span class="tei_closer"> 
                <span class="tei_salute">Your Devoted Friend,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Edmund C. Stedman.</span>
