                        reprinted. (William Livingston Alden, associate editor of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Citizen</span>, wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.01064">August 9</a>, <a href="loc.01067">August 19</a>, and <a href="loc.01068">November 18, 1867</a>. Whitman also corresponded
                        with Alden on <a href="hsp.00008">August 27, 1868</a>, in reference to
                        another piece.)</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">"A Carol of Harvest for 1867," first appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>. On August 1, 1867, William Conant Church, from the office
                        of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>, wrote to O'Connor: "It seems to me
                        that this glorious harvest of 1867, sown &amp; reaped by the returned
                        soldiers, ought to be sung in verse.…Walt Whitman is the man to chaunt
                        the song. Will you not ask him to do it for The Galaxy?" (Charles E.
                        Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
                        of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The editors, in a letter to Walt Whitman on
                            <a href="loc.01278">August 8, 1867</a>, considered "A Carol of
                        Harvest, for 1867" (later titled "The Return of the Heroes") "to rank with
                        the very best of your poems." For images and a transcription of "A Carol of

                    letters from Walt Whitman to his family for the latter part of the year, though,
                    as "A Check list of Whitman's Letters" makes clear, he wrote frequently. There
                    were no startling developments. While Jeff was in St. Louis, Martha lived with
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, and her children ("the young fry department," as Walt
                    Whitman's mother termed them on <a href="duk.00509">December 15, 1867</a>)
                    continued to annoy their grandmother. George spent some time in Philadelphia in
                    November on a job that Moses Lane evidently had obtained for him; for Lane, see
                    Whitman's <a href="wwh.00004">January 16, 1863</a> letter to Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman. Jeff returned to Brooklyn in December, and, on <a href="duk.00511">December 26, 1867</a>, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    reported that Jeff was taking his family to St. Louis. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
