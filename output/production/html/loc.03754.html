                    (1833–1904) began to practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War,
                    he was in the New Jersey legislature and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned
                    actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S.
                    Treasury during Chester Arthur's administration. In the 1870s, Whitman
                    frequently went to Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast (Whitman's Commonplace

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
                    see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
