                        earliest possible date for this letter, and December 12, 1868 is the latest
                        possible date; the most probable date for the letter is December 5, 1868.
                        The subjects of this letter are consistent with late November and early
                        December 1868, both the matter of Hannah (Whitman) Heyde's serious thumb
                        infection and the presence of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his wife
                        Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman in Brooklyn. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
                        the letter to December 5, 1868, which fell on a Saturday. Edwin Haviland
                        Miller accepted Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                        1961–77], 2:366). December 5 is the most probable date, though the
                        letter could fall a week earlier.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The letter very likely precedes Charles Heyde's December 8?, 1868 letter to
                        Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, which describes the surgical amputation of
                        Hannah's thumb (Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His
                            Family</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 225;
                        Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span>, 2:72–73, n. 37). Walt's <a href="loc.01683">December 8, 1868</a> letter to Samuel W. Thayer, in
                        response to Hannah's <a href="duk.00496">November 24, 1868</a> letter
                        to Walt (Trent Collection), corroborates the assumption that this letter is
                        unlikely to date before November 28 or after December 12 (Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:72–73, n. 37). As Louisa's
                        letter seconded Hannah's request to have Walt write to Thayer in her <a href="duk.05556">November 25, 1868</a> letter to Walt, Walt's letter
                        to Hannah, which Charles Heyde intercepted, and Heyde's letter to Louisa,
                        which Louisa summarized in this letter, followed in rapid succession.
                        Therefore, this letter from Louisa to Walt is from early December but not
                        after Hannah's surgery. It is likely also to follow Louisa's <a href="duk.00557">November 30–December 3, 1868</a> letter to
                        Walt, which offers further details about Hannah's thumb problems from
                        Heyde's letter. It is possible (but unlikely) that this letter dates to the
                        Saturday after Louisa's request to Walt to write Thayer (November 28), but
                        it dates no later than the Saturday following Hannah's surgery (December
                        12).</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
                    disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from

                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's youngest daughter, resided
                    in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L. Heyde. The phrase "began with
                    saying" that precedes Hannah's name marks the beginning of Louisa Van Velsor's
                    excerpt from Charles Heyde's letter, which continues on to the next page. At the
                    conclusion of her excerpt, she wrote, "all this i have copied from his letter."

                    is a mark that resembles a curly brace. Because the horizontal curved mark
                    intersects the curved mark after the word "next" in the line above, it may seem
                    that the intent is to insert the word "he says" after the word "next" in the
                    line above. However, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman explains the mark five lines
                    below; she has "copied from his letter except where i marked above." This
                    horizontal curved line is Louisa's mark to indicate that she is not quoting
                    these two words from Charles L. Heyde's letter: they are her own words rather
                    than a quotation from his letter. The mark after "next" is her usual closing
                    mark for a phrase, which functions rhetorically to close a phrase but may
                    resemble a closing parenthesis mark or a vertical pipe. Though the closing mark
                    after "next" and the curved line enclosing "he says" intersect physically on the
