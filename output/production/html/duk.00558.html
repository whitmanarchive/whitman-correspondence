            <p class="tei_p">i write a few lines to say
                i received a letter from heyde yesterday
                they all jeff and all set in for me to send
            the letter to you and i thought i would last
            night but to day i thought better of it
            i thought it would only put you out
            of temper as it did all of us) he first
            began with saying hanna was so she
            came out to the kichen and eat her meals
            but she is very far from complete recovery
            she is very frail constitutionally yet
            her hand or rather her thumb by what he
            says is quite bad and the flesh scrinks
            from the bone) this may all be true
            probably is) then he goes on to say that
            she is better off with him that any change
            would not benefit her or to that affect
            with his highfullatin phrases) well now
                for the second act) he says
            he received
            a very stupid letter from Walt addressed
            to han
            which he humanely concluded not
            to deliver to her and then he goes on to
            quote the first part of the letter he says
            it ran thus) i suppose my dear sister
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00558.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00558.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00558.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            you are by this time perfectly recovered
            and the next) what a stupid man and
            the balance he says
            is about nothing himself
            stuff i am out of patience let him stay
            in washington he has but small credit
            here i dont want to see him)</p>

            capable of doing i hope you have or will
            write to the Doctor and if you can go
            on there i should be glad matty says
            she makes no doubt the letter he kept
            from her was the one you spoke of her
            getting well enoughf when you came
            that she could come back with you
            i shall write to her and i shall write
            to him he is a very bad man very very
            but Walter dont lets think of him if han
            was away from him i should never
            want to hear his name again)
