            <p class="tei_p">Seems curiously quiet for election day, &amp; has been all the time here—At my
                proposal Ed Wilkins went over to Phila: from 12 to 3 &amp; took
                a note I sent to Tom Donaldson—(Ed says D treated
                him like a prince)—I am feeling better still—weather fine to day, sunny,
                rather warmish—I am trying to write a very short <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">concluding
                    note</span> to the big book but it holds fire, don't suit me—&amp; this is
                all that keeps matters back—but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">n'importe</span>—we are
                in no way hurry—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Yours came to-day—it is indeed queer you don't hear from Wm Gurd at all ('twas me I should be uneasy)—Tom Harned was here last evn'g—Horace too—a good deal ab't the election &amp;
                "politics"—(the whole contest ab't high tariff &amp; free trade is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">too
                    previous</span> &amp; sophomorical at present—too abstract—But it will be a
                great point one of these days)—Whatever is done or happens at present the U S
                will prosper, grow, advance, in the nature of things, these ages—</p>

                probably know before this reaches you—Fine weather still—I continue pretty
                well—No Osler for ten days—Ed Wilkins pleases me—Did you get the Phil: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> Oct
                27 with a quarter column notice of Nov. B?—If not I will send it you—As I write I
                am sitting here as usual in the big chair by the stove—window a little open—every
                thing quiet &amp; comfortable—</p>
