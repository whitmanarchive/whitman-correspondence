               <span class="tei_salute">Dear George,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I mailed you yesterday draft on Jay Cooke &amp; Co. for $510<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—which I presume has come to hand</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How soon will your house be done—Do you intend Mother shall move there and live for awhile?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—[these] are the two questions that are in my mind just now—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mattie has a bad cough and I have had several first class physicians to see her and they all unite in saying that a trip east for a few months would cure her<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—I have been very unfortunate in the selection of a house—and unfortunately have a lease of two years on it under very stringent papers too—It occurred to me that if Mother was not going to move I would try and get a furnished room in your neighborhood and send Mat and Jess on and if your new house was in the neighborhood of completion and you proposed to move in it I thought perhaps you could hire Mat a room in that.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The house is damp and I cannot seem to bettr it. I have spent abt $125 on it trying to fix it. I'm in a pretty tight place and will have to "wiggle" out of it—I am looking just now for some sort of a boarding school to send Hat for a few months till I can see how the matter is going to turn out—. The doctors all unite in declaring that Mat has no disease of the lungs<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—it is all in the bronchial tubes of the throat—of course it is going to be hard for us to break up just now—but I do not think it worth while to risk everything in trying to "stick" it out in a bad bargain—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my love to Mother—tell her Mat has a letter written to her<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> that I will mail in the morning—and write me in regard to questions asked</p>

                    consulting with Dr. A. D. Wilson, Walt Whitman wrote Jeff a detailed report of

                    reached one of the lungs. Nonetheless, Walt Whitman remarked, the doctor "thinks
                    there is no imminent danger at all—thinks that the physician in St. Louis
                    who advised a change from there here, couldn't have had any knowledge of
                    Brooklyn climate...nevertheless thinks that the journey &amp; a temporary change
                    will be very salutary" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
