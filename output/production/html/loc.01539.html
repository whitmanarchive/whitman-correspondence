        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd the $50 to-day all right, and a real help to me—I
        have money, but cannot have the use of it just now—so this comes first rate—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I spent yesterday down on the sea-shore—was all by myself—had a splendid good
        day—took my dinner with me—went down in the boat 12 miles in the morning, &amp;
        back in a big open horse car, toward evening, through the fields &amp; woods—very
        pleasant indeed—staid a long while in the water—weather perfect—Mother is
        better to-day—she has been pretty sick, with several ups &amp; downs—I am as
        well as a fellow can be—eat &amp; sleep tremendous—Shall stay here a week or so
        longer—shall be back first part of next week if nothing happens—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, Pete, I believe that is all this morning—Good bye, my darling son, and a long,
        long kiss from your loving father </p>
