        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd the $50 to-day all right,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> and a real help to me—I
        have money, but cannot have the use of it just now—so this comes first rate—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I spent yesterday down on the sea-shore—was all by myself—had a splendid good
        day—took my dinner with me—went down in the boat 12 miles in the morning, &amp;
        back in a big open horse car, toward evening, through the fields &amp; woods—very
        pleasant indeed—staid a long while in the water—weather perfect—Mother<a href="#n0705" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0705">2</a> is
        better to-day—she has been pretty sick, with several ups &amp; downs—I am as
        well as a fellow can be—eat &amp; sleep tremendous—Shall stay here a week or so
        longer—shall be back first part of next week if nothing happens—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, Pete, I believe that is all this morning—Good bye, my darling son, and a long,
        long kiss from your loving father </p>

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
