                    December 11, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke, on an accompanying slip of paper held
                    in the Trent Collection (not reproduced here), dated this letter December 18,
                    1867. In his calendar of letters, Edwin Haviland Miller assigned a
                    letter—presumably this one—from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Walt
                    Whitman a date range of December 1–15, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 1:379). By contrast, Randall H. Waldron cited Bucke's December
                    18, 1867 date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
                        Whitman</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 44). Bucke and
                    Waldron's date of December 18, which fell on Wednesday—the day of the week
                    in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand—would place this letter following her
                        <a href="duk.00509">December 15, 1867</a> letter to Walt. But the
                    present letter must precede that one. The letter notes Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman's arrival "here this morning," and in her December 15 letter Louisa
                    reported that Jeff "has got well again he eats so heartily." The December 15
                    letter in which Jeff is already in Brooklyn is firmly dated in Louisa's hand, so
                    this Wednesday letter—which notes Jeff's arrival—must precede that
                    one. </span></span> [<a href="#r17">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00422_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00422_n2"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the

                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
