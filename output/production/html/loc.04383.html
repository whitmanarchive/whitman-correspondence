                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Walt Whitman /</span> 
            </span>
               <p class="tei_p">Our friend H.L.T. set rather a bad precedent immediately after my 
              coming here! For 3 days in succession he wrote each day to the Dr. &amp; 
              to me. But yesterday <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">no</span> letter came at all. Of course, this 
              was only what one could reasonably expect, but after so much pampering &amp; indulgence one 
              becomes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">un</span>reasonable. And, as he said in his last letter 
              that you had reported a miserable day, I cannot help feeling anxious about you. However,
               <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00906_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00906_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00906_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
               the morning's mail will soon be here, &amp; we shall perhaps hear something of you—or, 
               more probably this afternoon.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I intended to write to you last night but hadn't a good opportunity.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Yesterday morning was a little showery, but warm. D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r.</span>
                &amp; I drove down to town, &amp; amongst other things called at Edy's. The 
               photo taken of Dr. the other day was not a success (Dr. had moved) so he had to sit again, 
               &amp; two negatives were taken.</p> 
               <p class="tei_p">Yesterday afternoon the annual Athletic Sports were held here, on the grounds in front 
                of the Refractory Wards. The weather 
               <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00907_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00907_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00907_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
               turned out gloriously fine, &amp; the sports were very successful &amp; went off 
               without any hitch. Quite a crowd of spectators,
               officials, employe's, patients, &amp;c, 
               &amp; the whole scene was very pretty &amp; picturesque. The patients were entirely well 
               behaved &amp; all seemed more or less happy.—The relationship between all classes 
               entirely human, simple &amp; kind.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">The Rev<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> Mr. Richardson had promised to come, 
               &amp; I had quite looked forward to meeting him as the
               chief event of the day for me. I knew that he had met you here—is mentioned in 
               D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r's</span> book—&amp; hoped
               to get some reminiscences &amp; facts from him. But I was disappointed. He was very pleasant &amp; 
               kind, &amp; I had quite a long talk with him,
               <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00908_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00908_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00908_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
               but found at the close that I had got nothing of any importance. God speed him &amp; good wishes
               to him!</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Quite a lot of people here to tea.—Rev.d &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Richardson, 
               another Rev.d ("Short'?)—D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> brother,

               &amp; Miss Bucke from London, another niece—also Miss Bucke—&amp; 
               two or three little girls.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> brother &amp; W.J. Gurd had just returned from a 
               month's "camping" in Muskoka &amp; were quite enthusiastic about it. Some talk too of 
               Canadian politics, English ditto, which I quietly listened to &amp; noted.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Later four of us drove off in carriage—Dr. calling in at Dr. Sippi's—I going 
               on to town with
               <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00909_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00909_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00909_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
               his brother, &amp; W.J.G. &amp; afterwards driving back to Sippi's for Dr. most 
               lovely moonlight night—Jupiter large, lustrous, regal. Arriving at home 
               Dr. got his glass out—could see three of Jupiter's moons,—one
               with the naked eye.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This morning eventful to the household here—Pardee went away @ 
               8 o'clock for Toronto. a youth from
               Toronto—(Archie—the Inspector's son)—who has been staying here 
               for 7 weeks—along with him. Miss Gurd
                (M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> B's cousin) to Sarnia M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> B. 
                with her for the day.</p>
               <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00910_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00910_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00910_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
               <p class="tei_p">Just as I had finished the foregoing Dr called for me to accompany him to town, &amp; brought me two letters from Traubel.
               I was delighted to find that you had been out on Sunday with beneficial results.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">What a wonderful fellow H.L.T. is! That he should be a devoted son to you is not surprising; but that he should be so zealous,
               ardent, &amp; affectionate towards <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span> astonishing! I wonder continually how he gets time for all his work, 
               &amp; energy to support him through it all. But he is a true son of yours in his generous comradeship.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">He forwarded me a letter

                   from my old school chum, &amp; dear friend always, Fred Wild.
               "Tell Walt," he says, "that I love him all the time." And that he means it, from the bottom of his heart, I know very well.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I write this @ 1.30 pm. Day gloriously fine—sky almost cloudless.—I wish you were here to sit on the Verandah &amp; to
               look out on the beautiful grounds in front, with their dappled shade &amp; sunshine.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">But the messenger will be here soon, &amp; as I want to write to Traubel before he comes 
               I will close.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">With a heart full of love to you always, &amp; all good wishes,</p>
