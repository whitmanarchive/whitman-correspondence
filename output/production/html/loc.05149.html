                    <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">I got your last, enclosing MS, on the 20th, and at once, as you suggested, sent
                    the document to the Sun, copying your draft of note to the editor, &amp;c. Let
                    us see if tomorrow's Sun will have it.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I infer from your suggestion that you think the article not so bad. Bad or good,
                    its publication by the Sun will make Fra Diavolo Godkin howl.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I return your Salt Lake City letter about Bacon and Shakespeare, having carefully
                    read it thrice. It seems quite crazy—though maybe only crude—yet has
                    some good points in it, which I took in.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I am in great mourning that I can't get my reply to Richard Grant White on the
                    Bacon-Shakespeare matter, printed. It was certainly brilliant, though I
                    say it as shouldn't. The North American man called it "so very valuable a
                    manuscript," apologizing for declining it on the ground that too much MS has
                    already been accepted—which is all gammon. Fanatical prejudice in favor of
                    Shakespeare, unwilling to allow discussion, is at the bottom of the matter.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I was in hope that Charley Eldridge would get to publishing, so that we might
                    start a magazine, and make it pleasant for the bats and owls and literary
                    carrion generally, but he appears to have abandoned the idea, and gone into law
                    and claims in Boston.</p>

                    <span class="tei_salute">Good bye. Faithfully</span>
