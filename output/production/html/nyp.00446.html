            </span>

<p class="tei_p">the book is out &amp; 1st edition quite exhausted<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you same mail with this a paper-bound copy of "Specimen Days" for your
                printing office use—will send you a regularly bound copy in a day or
                two—the volume is issued in precisely the same style as "Leaves of
                Grass"—same cloth binding, same butterfly on the back, same size,
                &amp;c.—It is a great jumble (as a man himself is)—Is an autobiography
                after its sort—(sort o' synonyms &amp; yet altogether
                different—"Montaigne," Rousseau's "Confessions" &amp;c)—is the gathering
                up, &amp; formulation, &amp; putting in identity of the wayward itemizings,
                memoranda, and personal notes of fifty years, under modern &amp; American
                conditions, a good deal helter-skelter but I am sure a certain sort of orbic
                compaction and oneness the final result—dwells long in its own peculiar way on
                the Secession War—gives glimpses of that event's strange interiors, especially
                the Army Hospitals—in fact makes the resuscitating and putting on record the
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">emotional aspect</span> of the war of 1861–'65 one of its
                principal features.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The years from 1876 to the present date Whitman has been a partial paralytic. Very
                much of his days—(and nights also as it appears)—he has spent in the
                open air down in the country in the woods and fields, and by a secluded little New
                Jersey river—His memoranda on the spot of these days and nights fill a goodly
                portion of the Volume—Then comes the "Collect," embodying "Democratic Vistas,"
                the Preface to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G.</span>​  of 1855, and much other prose.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is understood that Whitman himself considers "Specimen Days" the exponent and
                finish of his poetic work "Leaves of Grass," that each of the two volumes is
                indispensable in his view to the other, and that both together finally begin and
                illustrate his literary schemes in the New World. Talking lately in a half jocular
                vein to a friend he termed them his Adam and Eve, sent out in "this garden the
                world."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">(don't fail to copy this—can't it conclude your notice?)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">Four Phila: editions of "Leaves of Grass" have been issued &amp; sold within the last
                three months—they are now on the fifth—The first edition of "Specimen
                Days" has been exhausted in less than a week. They are now on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">second</span>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear B, if you notice—send me a paper—don't fail—Send also one each
                to

            <p class="tei_p">Dear B
                I have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="dashed​ ">dash'd</span>​  off all this to help you—to use (incorporate) or not as you think
                fit—you will understand—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Of course use whatever of this you want—incorporate it I mean in your

                    referred to a second printing; more probably Whitman overstated the success of
                    the volume so that Baxter would have good copy for his review in the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00446_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00446_n2"><span>This notation refers to
