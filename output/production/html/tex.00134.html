         <p class="tei_p">I received the other day from a "Breckinridge Democrat," now converted, the inclosed sum of twenty dollars, after he had read your letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have not lately made any requests of my friends for more thinking you perhaps were well supplied for the present. I shall be happy to hear from you again, &amp; I think I can find more friends hereafter if you should need them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send this by a check &amp; I presume they will cash it for you at Willards where they know me.
            </p>
