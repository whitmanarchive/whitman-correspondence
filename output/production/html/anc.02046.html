            <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_main-authorial">"walter dear": The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son Walt</h4>
            
            <div class="section">
                <p class="tei_p">Louisa Van Velsor Whitman closed a letter to Walt three times with the short  command, "burn this letter."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n1 note" id="n1"><span>Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00635.html">December 15–19, 1868</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00603.html">March 7–May 15, 1871</a>, and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00607.html">June 13, 1871</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span>  Her desire that what she had written would not be shared after the moment's  frustration had passed—her anger that her visiting son Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman  and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman had not paid for the food that they had consumed, or her frustration that son George Washington Whitman was no longer as generous to her  as formerly—signals her deep trust in the poet. She shared her complaints with him as a confidant. Louisa relied on Walt to ease the irritations endemic to limited financial  means—which he did by enclosing small sums of cash in most  of his letters to her—and she was able to manage the  everyday frustrations of working-class life by putting her annoyance  into the written word.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">The letters that she wished Walt to destroy—witness today that at least in some  instances he neglected her wishes or chose to disregard her will—are deeply  disquieting. They remind us that her letters were personal and not public, intended  by Louisa for Walt but also to be forwarded—or not—only within the  family. But we should not be naïve about Walt's violation of Louisa's trust:  she well knew that he sometimes forwarded her letters within the family as a  reminder or rebuke, and her letter of complaint to Walt carried both the risk and promise  that he would intervene on her behalf. Her faith in Walt was not  absolute, for she sometimes chose to spare him the full  truth. On December 4, 1863, the body of her deceased son Andrew Jackson Whitman laid in  state on another floor of the Portland Avenue house. That evening Louisa's eldest  and mentally disturbed son Jesse Whitman had a vicious outburst toward Jeff's wife Mattie  and their three-year-old daughter Manahatta. When Louisa described Andrew's death to  Walt on the evening that Andrew died, she closed her letter with the phrase "composed and ca[lm?]"  and had no intent to distract from the solemnity that she  wished to convey by including a description of Jesse's outburst. She added to her letter the next day because she feared that  Jeff would send Walt a more inflammatory  account. With her initial hope to withhold from Walt the full extent  of the previous night's episode with Jesse,  Louisa may have sought to avoid compounding the desolation of grief.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Her December 4–5, 1863 letter has an affinity to the tenderness in Walt's best-known Civil War poetry: her private letters, whose complaints are directed at those who are long dead, have blended into Walt's purpose in preserving them as a memorial of their relationship. That I edit them and that the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Archive</span> publishes them are only the most recent acts, which build on the efforts of generations, that of Walt and his disciple-executors, of collectors and archivists, and of scholars and funding bodies who have undertaken and supported their preservation and study. Her letters offer insight into Walt's life, but they are more important for their insights into Louisa's own life as a subject worthy of our attention today.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Walt ensured that a large number of Louisa's letters to him would be preserved, and  recent scholars have offered sympathetic readings of them. But she remains a  challenging figure because one of Walt's most well-known statements about her  influence on him touches the core of his great poem. Walt claimed, in conversation  with Horace L. Traubel, that she was "illiterate in the formal sense" but that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was the "flower of her temperament active in me."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n2 note" id="n2"><span>Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915), 2:113. </span></span> Walt's conceit about his mother's importance resists critical analysis, but the many readings of that quotation, especially whether one emphasizes the word "temperament" or "illiterate," do provide a rough index to the sometimes overlapping periods in the critical commentary on Louisa. Walt's early disciples emphasized her temperament as an influence on his poetry in the context of Victorian motherhood (1880–1940); this early Louisa, the ideal that Walt celebrated, gave way to a phase that emphasized the great poet's struggle to overcome his domineering mother (1940–1970). After scholarly critics agreed that Louisa's malevolent dominance was fundamental to Walt's psychological makeup, her illiteracy emerged (1960–1995) as a necessary aspect of her malevolent influence, part of the temperament that Walt had to overcome. The present period (1996– ) has rejected her corrosive psychological influence and instead leaned on Walt's qualification "formal sense," a phase of criticism that has inspired close reading of her archival letters both as cultural documents and as contributions to Walt's poetic voice. After a brief review of this critical heritage, I will examine a passage from a May 1868 letter that may suggest to some the grounds for her illiteracy. I will argue instead that it illustrates Walt's claim, in the same August 1888 conversation with Traubel, for his mother's "great mimetic power."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n3 note" id="n3"><span>Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> 2:114. </span></span></p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Walt's disciples echoed his insistence on Louisa's robust health and celebrated her  admirable temperament, but the matter of her literacy was of no consequence for the  ideology of Republican motherhood that he extolled in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic  Vistas</span> (1871)—and for which he offered his mother as an exemplar.  John Burroughs, after an 1868 visit to Brooklyn, described her: "A spry, vivacious,  handsome old lady, worthy of her illustrious son." Later, he blessed Walt's opinion  that she was the "perfect woman and mother."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n4 note" id="n4"><span>John  Burroughs, June 1868 letter to Ursula North Burroughs, quoted in Clara Barrus,  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,  1931), 57. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person,</span> 2nd  ed. (New York: Redfield, 1871), 79. </span></span> A recent reviewer of Whitman  biographies deadpanned that Burroughs's descriptions of her "could have been  embroidered on a Victorian sampler."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n5 note" id="n5"><span>Jeffrey  Meyers, "Whitman's Lives," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Antioch Review</span> 63.4  (October 1, 2005), 764. </span></span> Another disciple, Richard Maurice Bucke, praised  her as "remarkably healthy and strong, had a kind, generous heart, good sense, and a  cheerful and even temper."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n6 note" id="n6"><span>Richard  Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Glasgow: Wilson &amp;  McCormick, 1884), 15. </span></span> For Walt, who believed in ancestral inheritance of  personal qualities, his own claims for good health and good habits required a  parent, his mother, to bestow them. His celebration of her temperament and health went unquestioned by his earliest disciples, and her illiteracy was a matter of no moment.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Louisa's illiteracy emerged as a topic slightly later, with the first generation of Whitman's scholarly biographers, who sought a psychological subtext within Walt's family background that his poetry could transcend. The Louisa who served this purpose was granted a functional literacy but denied the ability to understand Walt's poetry. Walt's brother George in conversation with Traubel had claimed that both he and his mother found <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> incomprehensible: "Mother thought as I did—did not know what to make of it. [. . . .] I remember mother comparing Hiawatha to Walt's, and the one seemed to us pretty much the same muddle as the other. Mother said that if Hiawatha was poetry, perhaps Walt's was."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n7 note" id="n7"><span>Horace L. Traubel, "Notes from Conversations with George W. Whitman, 1893: Mostly in His Own Words," in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re Walt Whitman</span>, ed. Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893), 35–36. "Hiawatha" refers to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Song of Hiawatha</span> (1855), a popular poem and exact contemporary to the first edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. </span></span> Because Louisa's inability to understand her son's poetry seemed the precondition for the stunted psychological growth that he overcame in his poetry—but not in his personal and sexual life—Henry Seidel Canby makes her temperament a fundamental quality: "she was one of those ample women, wise and of great heart, who powerfully hold together families and succeed by character and love." For her literacy, by contrast, Canby resorts to an odd paradox, that she was "as near illiterate as one can be who can read and write."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n8 note" id="n8"><span>Henry Seidel Canby, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman, an American: a Study in Biography</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1943), 12, 13. </span></span> These hints at her illiteracy would not yet hold sway in criticism: two early studies, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver's selection of family letters and Gay Wilson Allen's biography, were exceptionally sympathetic toward Louisa. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</span> (1949) offers the full text of fifteen of her letters, and Gohdes and Silver detect a "noble lustre" in her eyes.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n9 note" id="n9"><span>Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and Family</span> (New York: AMS Press, 1965; rpt. Duke University Press, 1949), 184–205, 180–181, 185. </span></span> In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The</span> <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span> (1949) Allen reported George's opinion as representative of the entire Whitman family's attitude toward Walt's poetry—that they could not  "understand it when it was in print"—but he quoted also from many of Louisa's letters, including her comments on reviews of Walt's poetry, and thereby affirmed her basic literacy.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n10 note" id="n10"><span>Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</span> (1955; rev. ed.

                <p class="tei_p">A scholar of the succeeding generation, Edwin Haviland Miller, did not label Louisa  illiterate but did insist that her personality was a psychologically debilitating  burden for the poet. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Poetry: A Psychological  Journey</span> (1968), Miller referred to Louisa's "aggressive nature," her "emasculating  rule" over the family, and the "nagging querulousness" in her letters.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n11 note" id="n11"><span>Edwin Haviland Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Poetry: A Psychological Journey</span> (New York:  New York University Press, 1968), 48, 55. </span></span> Miller, editor of  the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> (1961–1977),  extended the influence of his emphasis on familial burdens in his  explanatory annotations to the letters, which when citing Louisa's letters often  highlight her complaints, lack of humor, and bitterness. After psychological  readings became widespread in literary biography—and domineering mothers were  identified as a cause for homosexuality<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n12 note" id="n12"><span>For historical phases in psychoanalytic theory on causes for  homosexuality, see Jack Drescher, "A History of Homosexuality and Organized Psychoanalysis," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Journal of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry</span> 36 (2008), 443–460; and "Causes and Becauses: On Etiological Theories of Homosexuality," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Annual of Psychoanalysis</span> 30 (2002), 58–59. </span></span>—critics assumed that Louisa's illiteracy could underscore the familial influences that Walt overcame: one called her "illiterate" and referred to her "inability to read," and another designated her a "semi-literate mother."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n13 note" id="n13"><span> Larzer Ziff, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Literary Democracy: the Declaration of Cultural Independence in America</span> (New York: Viking Press, 1981), 233.

                <p class="tei_p">These two related phases of Whitman scholarship, which lasted from the 1940s into the  1990s, are now long past but are the foreground from which the current phase of more  sympathetic interest in Louisa emerged. Studies by Sherry Ceniza and by Michael Moon  and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, all of whom read widely within the archival letters,  offer a far more sympathetic portrait of Louisa. Ceniza argues that the absence of  punctuation in her writing is not a fault but a stylistic virtue: "her letters begin to take on a life of their own, demanding a new relationship between the reader and text." She also counters Miller's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> annotations with expanded contextual analysis, and she notes that many critics' statements on the poet's mother are factually inaccurate.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n14 note" id="n14"><span>Sherry Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span> (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 21, 13–15. </span></span> Sedgwick and Moon quote from many of Louisa's letters: the former offers Walt's relationship with his mother as a partial antidote to "the whole landscape of thinking about gay men and their mothers," and the latter catalogs Louisa's linguistic gifts, her "sheer love of articulation and narration" and her "pithy framing of pitiless truths."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n15 note" id="n15"><span> Michael Moon and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, "Confusion of Tongues," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Breaking Bounds: Whitman and American Cultural Studies</span>, ed. Betsy Erkkila and Jay Grossman (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 25–26. </span></span> Whitman's recent scholarly biographers—Justin Kaplan, Jerome Loving, and David S. Reynolds—have offered sympathetic (but not extended) analyses of his relationship to Louisa. By contrast, Robert Roper in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span> (2008), his family biography of the Civil War years, refers to Louisa's letters in the Trent Collection at Duke University as one of the "true treasures [that] helped shape my sense of the inner life of the Whitman family." He quotes Louisa's letters extensively and lauds her "quicksilver intelligence and unostentatious decency."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n16 note" id="n16"><span>Robert Roper, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War: Walt Whitman and His Brothers in the Civil War</span> (New York: Walker, 2008), 382, 9, 69–81, 202. </span></span> Given this transformation in critical opinion, the present moment is apt to initiate a new phase of study by making all of her known letters to Walt available in facsimile and annotated transcription, available both to scholars and to the general public.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Attempting to read the letters, some may find that her unmarked syntactic units offer significant challenges, but the manuscripts nonetheless remain essential documents for family biography. The letters enrich Walt's biography from the publication of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> through his Civil War hospital work, during Reconstruction when first William D. O'Connor and others began elevating his reputation as a poet, and through the intense period of correspondence between Walt's January 1873 stroke and Louisa's death in May of the same year. Her letters to a brief extent also comment on periods in her life preceding the letters. The newly identified and newly dated letters in this edition—the first comprehensive analysis undertaken—offer a rich portrait of her life, of Walt's close emotional affinity to her and of her emotional and financial dependence upon him, and of family dramas during just over a dozen years. This digital edition, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">"walter dear": The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son Walt</span>, includes this introduction and one hundred seventy letters from her to him. This edition corrects some misunderstandings about Whitman family biography, and it offers Louisa the opportunity to put to rest questions about her literacy, to assert her dignity in her own words, and—though an editor cannot escape complicity in Walt's effort to shape his mother's memory—to complicate some of Walt's efforts to shape her legacy and his own.</p>
                
                <div class="tei_p p">When encountering her letters for the first time, hold in mind Louisa's insistence to  her own son that the reader bears the burden of understanding. She once reminded  Walt that he might need to expend effort to grasp her message: "if you cant  understand walter dear you must read it over two or three times)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n17 note" id="n17"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00581.html">June 23, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span>  Louisa's "walter dear" would not have found her demand off-putting: he sympathized  with her concerns, read her letters in series (most no more than a day or two after  she wrote them), and was long accustomed to extracting phrases from a stream of  words unbroken by formal punctuation. In a mid-May 1868 letter, she  described a household incident from the day before, and it is one of the more  challenging passages in the entire letters corpus: 
                    <span class="tei_floatingText">

                    </span>  
                    
                    Editorial transcription will of course aid reading for those unfamiliar with her hand, but transcription adds complexity of another sort. The characters in square brackets are not fully legible in the manuscript, and the question mark before the closing bracket signals uncertainty. Even when transcribed, however, her words are unfamiliar in a dual sense: they are not from family and are removed in time from our own moment as readers. Scholarly annotation is needed to provide basic personal and cultural contexts. In this case, the "eagle" is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, a Democratic-leaning newspaper; Edward (Edd) is her mentally and physically disabled son; and the unnamed man downstairs identifies with the Democratic party. Louisa generally preferred Republican ideals: her son George had risked his life in war, and Walt's employment was under Republican administrations, as a clerk in the nation's capital. Both Louisa and George agreed that the efforts of Radical Republicans to reassert control over Reconstruction and to impeach Andrew Johnson were justified, though Louisa became ambivalent about the prospect of removing the president from office.</div>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Nonetheless, even with these basic contexts understood, Louisa's act of mimicry places real demands on readers. She reported to Walt Edward's exchange with the unnamed Democrat and her teasing interaction with Edward as he struggled to convey the exchange to her. After the Democrat said "the radicals were all down," Edward became agitated. Louisa dramatizes Edward's report of the Democrat's words, her interruption to seek clarification, and her son's growing exasperation. Yet her disregard of conventional punctuation may well threaten our ability to understand her: "he would never have any thing more to doo withe them i how doo you know he is clear he said." A reader can easily lose track of who "he" is—Edward or the Democrat—and what "he" says. The key word is "i," which marks a change in speakers.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">The passage can be rendered more straightforward by marking syntactic units with  punctuation and by adding explanatory words: "I [said], 'how do you know?' Edd is  clear [the Democrat] said, 'it was in the eagle [….]' It [Edd's reaction] was  quite amusing […]." This annotated quotation-paraphrase offers a  reasonable reading, but it is not the only one that a reader could devise. Alternate  readings and disagreements about emphasis are to be expected when serious readers  take up these transcriptions and their manuscript source, but this short  passage—you might try reading it a second or third time—demonstrates  what Walt considered her "mimetic power": she performs with remarkable economy both  Edward's encounter with the Democrat and her conversation with Edward in a mere one  hundred fifteen words. As Ceniza has suggested, Louisa's words will  "take on a life  of their own" in other minds.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n19 note" id="n19"><span>Ceniza,  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century  Women Reformers</span>, 21. </span></span></p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Louisa's letters generally lack  punctuation aside from one mark that resembles a closing parenthesis, and her  spelling is inconsistent and sometimes phonetic for rarely used words. It is  unlikely that she had access to primary schooling or tutoring, and one can detect no  hint of formal instruction in writing. But she nonetheless managed from a smattering  of instruction, access to printed and handwritten texts, and force of will to acquire the  ability to write. What her letters lack in conventional correctness—and we  should be cautious even about that conclusion because manuscripts from early  nineteenth-century authors often seem careless to us when regarded with the standards for spelling and syntactical punctuation in later decades—is of little matter against their considerable power and expressiveness. That is what Walt's qualification "formal sense" must mean, and Ceniza's description of her writing with Walt's phrase "family usages" from "There Was a Child Went Forth" is apt.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n121 note" id="n121"><span>Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span>, 21. </span></span> Her private letters are her only known writing, but they exhibit a substantially realized power of verbal expression. The remainder of this introduction—before it  turns to editorial policies—provides a biography of her life before the  letters, a review of her life in the periods during which her letters are extant,  notes on how her newly edited letters alter previously assumed details about Whitman  family lives, and a review of how her letters can contribute to a better understanding of her relationship to Walt and can help to identify possible influences on his poetry.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Walt's remarks on his Van Velsor ancestors and his mother's health before her  marriage and through his own early adulthood should be accepted with caution, if  accepted at all. Many of Louisa's children suffered ill health, both mental and  physical: Walt himself had signs of hypertension in his forties and suffered a  serious stroke in his fifties. He was well past middle age when he recounted his  family history to Burroughs, so he may exhibit his mother's splendid health in her  youth—like her temperament—for the purpose of poetic self-fashioning. Be  that as it may, Louisa when a young woman was courted by Walter Whitman, Sr.  (1789–1855), a skilled carpenter who had built a house near a twenty-acre  apple orchard on West Hills; they married in June 1816.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n24 note" id="n24"><span>Joseph Jay Rubin, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Historic Whitman</span>  (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1973), 10. </span></span> The  farming homestead from which the family of Walter, Sr., hailed at the turn of the  century represented comparative wealth in land and slaves.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n25 note" id="n25"><span>Burroughs, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman</span>, quoted in  Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>, 11. </span></span> But Walter, Sr., was  reduced in social and economic status to subsistence farming. The Whitman family's  financial difficulties stretched back at least a decade before the marriage, which  may be why Walter, Sr., in his teens was apprenticed as a carpenter to Jacob  Whitman, an older cousin, in New York.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n26 note" id="n26"><span>Roper, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span>, 18. </span></span> There Walt's father likely encountered Thomas Paine, the Revolutionary figure with the greatest appeal to the working class and artisans of the era. We know little of Louisa's future husband as a young man, but we may speculate that he like his son was able to wander freely in New York streets during an era marked by enthusiasm for the possibilities of public education and religious and social reform but also by laissez faire acceptance of poverty, prostitution, cheap drink, and public entertainments that would periodically devolve into violence.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Louisa as a young woman may well have shared her husband's enthusiasm for the social promises   of a reforming age—Walter, Sr., is well known for his admiration of Quaker reformer   Elias Hicks and woman's rights advocate Frances Wright<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n27 note" id="n27"><span>John Rietz, "Whitman, Walter, Sr. [1789-1855]," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt   Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed.

Neither Walter, Sr., nor Louisa were members of an organized church, but the   Whitman children may have received some education in Brooklyn's church-affiliated primary   schools, including the Episcopal and Dutch Reformed.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n28 note" id="n28"><span>Floyd   Stovall, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Foregrounds of Leaves of Grass</span> (Charlottesville:   University Press of Virginia, 1974), 24. </span></span> Louisa shared her husband's admiration   for Hicks, who preached the value of Inner Light against the authority of ordained clergy,   and Walt credited his mother for introducing him to Hicks.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n29 note" id="n29"><span>Horace Traubel, "Whitman in Old Age: From Horace Traubel's Record," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</span> 74 (1907), 749. </span></span> Walt's brother George claimed that their mother "pretended to be a Baptist": the matter of "pretending" cannot be documented in her letters, but she found the words of a Baptist minister consoling after her husband's funeral in 1855.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n30 note" id="n30"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 13–18?, 1855 letter to Hannah Whitman Heyde, quoted in Clifton Joseph Furness, Review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Giant: Walt Whitman and his Times</span>, by Frances Winwar, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span> 14 (January 1942), 427. </span></span> Her youngest son Edward was a devout parishioner of Henry Ward Beecher's Plymouth Church, though Louisa never mentioned joining him there herself. She was not devout and adhered to no particular creed, but the death of two sons and a daughter-in-law drew from her expressions of resignation to the will of a higher power.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Initial aspirations that Louisa and her husband shared of an intellectual or public reform bent must have been dampened by the hardships—financial and physical—that marked their early marriage. For Louisa the two- and three-year cycles of pregnancy and childbirth that dominated her life between 1818 and 1835 surely exacted a physical and emotional toll. Before the second anniversary of her marriage, she gave birth on March 2, 1818 to her first son Jesse, and Walter followed on May 31, 1819. (The poet would be known generally in his family as Walt, but Louisa's letters refer often to her son by his full name Walter.) The birth of Louisa's first daughter Mary Elizabeth followed just under two years after the poet's, on February 3, 1821. We have no Whitman family accounts from this period, but the year of Jesse's birth coincided with the beginning of widespread suffering among working class people following the "Panic of 1818," a period known colloquially as "hard times." London banks reined in credit at the conclusion of the Napoleonic conflicts, and the credit contraction cycled into North America. The newly-formed Bank of the United States squeezed state banks, which in turn stopped redeeming paper specie with gold and called in their loans from tenant farmers.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n32 note" id="n32"><span>For the "Panic of 1818," see Daniel Walker Howe, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">What Hath God Wrought: the Transformation of America, 1815–1848</span> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 142–143. </span></span> Reduced to subsistence farming and cutting firewood instead of skilled carpentry, Walter, Sr., sold the West Hills homestead in 1823, a choice that reflected personal financial hardship but was in accord with the wider economic turmoil of the period.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">On May 27, 1823, Walter, Sr., moved Louisa and their three children under five years  of age to the port city of Brooklyn, thirty miles west, at the mouth end of Walt's  "fish-shape Paumanok," Long Island. They settled into a rented house on Front Street  near Main Street, also known as New Ferry Road.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n33 note" id="n33"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 1, 3, 5. </span></span> But  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">settled</span> is an inapt word because the family's first decade in  Brooklyn was marked by dizzying address changes and childbirths. Louisa, already  pregnant when the family departed West Hills, gave birth to daughter Hannah Louisa Whitman in Brooklyn on November 28, 1823.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n34 note" id="n34"><span>Rubin, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Historic Whitman</span>, 12. </span></span> Shortly after Hannah's birth, the family moved to Cranberry Street, and then in September 1824 Walter, Sr., purchased a lot on the corner of Washington and Johnson. With this purchase he began speculative housebuilding, a business that his sons Walt and George would later follow, which ideally produced a cycle of "buy, build, sell, and move all over again."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n35 note" id="n35"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 7. </span></span> According to Walt, the first houses on Front, Cranberry, and Johnson Street (at the corner of Washington) were "mortgaged, and we lost them."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n36 note" id="n36"><span>Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>, 14. </span></span> Even the ideal cycle of such a business could hardly have been welcome for a mother with many young children—and Louisa's later letters show a distaste for moving—but Louisa's other sources of grief during this period may have made financial hardship secondary. A son, who was never christened, was born to Louisa and Walter, Sr., in March 1825, and died six months later on September 14, 1825.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n37 note" id="n37"><span>Birth date of unnamed infant son: March 12, 1825, Whitman Family Bible, Library of Congress, Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman,</span> illus. after page 208; or March 2, 1825, Richard Maurice Bucke, Family Records, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 596, 597, n. 6. </span></span> Louisa's mother Amy Williams died in February 1826, compounding her grief during one of the darkest periods of her life.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">The family's subsequent Brooklyn homes were on Van Dykes (1826), Adams (1827),  Tillary (May 1827), and another house also on Tillary and Adams, probably the one at  which the family remained from late 1827 through November 1831, which was followed  by a move to Henry Street.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n38 note" id="n38"><span>Walt Whitman,  Manuscript Notebook 4, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of  Walt Whitman: Much of Which Has Been but Recently Discovered with Various  Early Manuscripts Now First Published</span>, ed.

Reynolds surmises, that the first house on Johnson and one of the houses on Tillary were not part of a buy-build-sell cycle but were mortgaged, lost, and subsequently rented back.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n39 note" id="n39"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 598–599.

Knopf, 1996), 25. </span></span> Just before the first move to a house on Tillary, Louisa bore the first of three sons to be named after a former American president, Andrew Jackson Whitman on April 7, 1827. The two sons who followed in approximately three-year intervals also bore presidential namesakes, George Washington Whitman on November 28, 1829 and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman on July 18, 1833. At the time of Jeff's birth, the older children, from Jesse through Andrew, were attending or (within five or six years) had matriculated through a public primary school in Brooklyn on Adams and Concord Streets. Tutors and private schools had long served the social and economic elite, but public schooling for families like the Whitmans was another concrete sign of possibilities in a reforming age and an opportunity to cultivate a range of social acquaintances.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n40 note" id="n40"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 10.

                <p class="tei_p">The conditions of Louisa's early marriage must remain speculative, but Walt's  memories and some comments in her letters suggest that she was deeply unhappy.  Walter, Sr., was unlikely to have aided with the mundane but grueling tasks of  childcare and housework—scrubbing clothes and floors, canning, baking, and  daily cooking—and such stresses along with serial childbirths may have  contributed to the extended illness or depression that followed Jeff's birth. One  telling remark about Louisa's childbearing years appears in her letters. Her  daughter-in-law Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (referred to in this introduction as "Louisa Orr" to distinguish her), who was suspected pregnant, was confined to bed, carried by her husband up and down the stairs, and attended by an aunt, an ordering of affairs that surprised Louisa: "its seems so different from what i have always had to go through)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n41 note" id="n41"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00630.html">April 3, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Further, Walter, Sr., may have contributed significantly to his wife's suffering, especially  if his frustrations with financial setbacks and his probable dependency on alcohol  led to emotional and physical abuse. According to Reynolds, one cause for financial  hardship may have been that Walter, Sr., insisted on handcrafted work, which made it  difficult for him to compete with "the more modern technique of prefabricated parts  installed by specialized workers."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n42 note" id="n42"><span>Reynolds, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's America</span>, 25. </span></span> According to  Burroughs, Walt recalled his father as having been "one time addicted to  alcohol."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n43 note" id="n43"><span>Cited in Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs Comrades</span>, 254. </span></span> Jerome M. Loving  identifies alcoholism, the compulsion that also wracked Walt's brothers Jesse and  Andrew, as a possible contributor to the failed mortgages of Walter, Sr., in the  early Brooklyn years.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n44 note" id="n44"><span>Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself</span>, 30. </span></span> The poet's  "father" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> Leaves of Grass </span>(1855)—"strong,  selfsufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust / The blow, the quick loud  word"—may well reflect some qualities of the relationship between Walter, Sr.,  and his son, as many biographers assume. The same qualities would have made him a  difficult or, more accurately, abusive husband. Louisa's letters support  a reasonable suspicion that she endured in marriage episodes of physical or  emotional abuse. Louisa did not describe her own marriage, but her  description of verbal and physical altercations in other marriages—some of which  include physical violence and emotional harassment—suggest that behavior  which by today's standards might qualify as spousal abuse seemed to her  a familiar part of married life. When her son Andrew went on drinking binges, Louisa blamed  his doing so on the poor housekeeping of his wife Nancy.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n45 note" id="n45"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00430.html">September 25 or October 2, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The husband of Louisa's neighbor Janey (or Jenne) Chapell "knocked her down":  Louisa approved Janey's fighting spirit in such encounters with her  husband—"gives as much back as she gets"—and disparaged  her own daughter Hannah's silent suffering in response to her husband  Charles Heyde's verbal abuse.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n46 note" id="n46"><span>Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00560.html">March 31, 1869</a> letter to Walt  Whitman. </span></span>   </p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">One of the few positive mentions of the temperament of Walter, Sr., appears in Walt's  September 1863 letter to his mother, in which a soldier who "often made me think of  father" is described as "large, slow, good natured" and "shrewd, very little to  say."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n47 note" id="n47"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00789.html">September 15, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman. </span></span> Yet if what Louisa endured as a young woman did not approach the  obvious abuse that her neighbor Janey suffered decades later, the phrase "little to  say" also delineates a significant difference between husband and wife. Louisa was a  gifted conversationalist and probably quite voluble. The Louisa of the letters was  socially engaged, read multiple periodicals, and cultivated a wide circle of  friends. She visited many of Walt's and Jeff's friends and had a wide network of her  own, including Abby Price and her two daughters, neighbors Grace Haight, Mrs. Black,  and Margret Steers, and Anna Van Wyck. Louisa's Myrtle Street friend Grace Haight  recalled her gift for conversation: a rap at Louisa's door elicited the call "come  in" and the greeting "How do you do, Grace," both familiar preludes to "pleasantly  pass[ing?] an evening with you" engaged in talk and harmless gossip.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n48 note" id="n48"><span>Grace Haight, September  22, 1872 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Feinberg Collection,  Library of Congress). </span></span> Louisa's surviving letters to Walt mention her husband of almost  thirty-nine years only twice, once after Andrew's December 1863 death—her son  has been buried as close as possible to his father's grave—and a second time several  years later to recall that the wish of Walter, Sr., to everyone was "good luck to  you."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n272 note" id="n272"><span>Louisa  Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00513.html">February 17, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span>   </p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Shortly before Jeff's birth in 1833, the family departed Brooklyn to return to West  Hills, and from this period Walt's early writings and his later recollections  suggest that Louisa's health was seriously compromised and that he, when a young  teen, began both to rebel against his father and to assume a semi-parental role for  his siblings. The family, though not the two eldest sons Jesse and Walt, the latter  a printer's apprentice in New York, departed Brooklyn in May 1833 and settled in  Norwich in 1834.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n49 note" id="n49"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 22, 24. </span></span> The disposition of Walter,  Sr., to drink and his many failed financial transactions may have led to the  family's removal from Brooklyn, but the family soon found relief from financial  stress with the sale of a portion of inherited West Hills land for $2,250.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n50 note" id="n50"><span>Rubin, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Historic  Whitman</span>, 32. </span></span> The sale, which fell near the death of Hannah  Brush, the mother of Walter, Sr., preceded by about a year the birth  of the Whitmans youngest child Edward on August 9, 1835, who  suffered physical deformity of his limbs, epileptic seizures, and  limited mental capacity. He remained in his mother's care until her death. Walt,  who visited his family often during the period before Edward's birth, recalled that his mother had been "very ill for a long time."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n51 note" id="n51"><span>Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>, 16. </span></span></p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">The Whitman family spent the ten years from 1836 through 1845 in various rural Long  Island villages: Hempstead in May 1836, Babylon in August 1836, Long Swamp in spring  1837, and Smithtown in fall of the same year.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n52 note" id="n52"><span>Whitman, Manuscript Notebook 4, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Uncollected  Poetry and Prose</span>, 2:86. </span></span> Walt taught in eight schools at  locations near his family but was eventually drawn back to the newspaper and  printing trade.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n53 note" id="n53"><span>Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt  Whitman: The Song of Himself</span>, 37–39 </span></span> His "Our Boys and Girls,"  a sketch of reminiscence published in May 1844 but probably drafted earlier,  provides a charming, though overdrawn and allegorical, portrait of his siblings. One  "niece" and the three "nephews" in the sketch share the names of four of Walt's  siblings, and the others, though unnamed, are easily identified. Hannah, by her  middle name "Louisa," is the "fairest and most delicate of human blossoms," and her  toddler brother (Edward) is an "imp of mischief" with a "stout pair of dumpy hands."  Walt reports formerly having carried his younger brother George Washington on his  shoulders, having taught Thomas Jefferson to read, and wrestling with his younger  brother Andrew Jackson. Walt issues a stern sentimental warning to the unnamed Mary,  aged fourteen, a "beautiful girl": "Flattery comes too often to her ears." According  to the sketch, two children in the family have died, a boy who was buried "in the  early summer" and a girl was buried "a mere month only after she came into the  world."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n54 note" id="n54"><span>"My Boys and Girls," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Rover</span>, April 20, 1844.

Brasher (New York: New York  University Press, 1963), 248–250. </span></span> Because conventional sentiment  blends with autobiography in the sketch, a deceased infant girl, not mentioned  elsewhere, is most likely a sentimental creation serving the impulse  to balance the other lost child. Walt—aged 25 when the sketch was first published but depicting the family in 1835 when he was in his teens—sketches himself in the "exercise of a semi-parental role."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n55 note" id="n55"><span>Justin Kaplan, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: A Life</span> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980), 86.

Whatever anxieties Walt had entertained for his sister Mary's future a decade before the sketch's publication had become moot: she married Ansel Van Nostrand and moved to Greenport in May 1840, the same month that the Whitman family moved again, to Dix Hills.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n56 note" id="n56"><span>Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Uncollected Poetry and Prose</span>, 2:87. </span></span></p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">Robert Roper argues persuasively that Walt as a young journalist was enterprising   and ambitious and that during the Civil War he "worked until he collapsed."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n276 note" id="n276"><span>Roper,   <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span>, 33–34, 240. </span></span> The same tendency toward hard work was present also   during his antebellum stint as a housebuilder. Charles E. Feinberg concluded only that   Walt was "modestly successful in business  matters" before publishing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, but Feinberg debunked thoroughly the idle loafer of Walt's own poetic myth.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n57 note" id="n57"><span>Charles E. Feinberg, "A Whitman Collector Destroys a Whitman Myth," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America</span> 52 (Second Quarter, 1958), 91. </span></span> Nonetheless, the constant moves that were required when building houses on speculation with limited capital—practiced in Brooklyn first by Walter, Sr., from 1823 through 1833 and again in 1844, by his son Walt perhaps as early as 1845 but avidly between 1848 and 1854, and by Walt's brother George between 1866 and 1870—must have worn on Louisa. She was dependent on each while he was engaged in the business, and subject to its vagaries. The Whitman family returned to Brooklyn in 1844, where Walter, Sr., in October bought a lot on Prince Street. The family lived briefly on Gold Street and then moved into a house that Walter, Sr., (probably with the assistance of his sons Walt and George) had completed at 71 Prince Street, where Walt joined them.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n58 note" id="n58"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 68, 599. </span></span> According to Feinberg, Walt (not his father) in 1845 purchased a lot on Prince Street, and he built a house on 106 Myrtle Avenue to which the family moved in April 1848. Walt sold that house in 1852 and moved the family to a two-story house on Cumberland Street—Walt built two more houses on the same street—at which the family remained for one year.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n59 note" id="n59"><span>Feinberg, "A Whitman Collector," 75, 78, 83, 87, 89.

Whitman, Manuscript Notebook 4, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Uncollected Poetry and Prose</span>, 2:88. </span></span> When the receipts and real estate records assembled by Feinberg and Molinoff are aligned to Walt's own manuscript record of the homes in which his family lived, the constant impulse in Louisa's letters—to settle and remain in a modest house—is easily understood. Children continued to depart the household—Hannah left Brooklyn for Vermont after her marriage to Charles Heyde in 1852. That her children were older  may have eased the physical burdens of Louisa's home life, but the housebuilding business had prevented her finding a place to settle for an extended time. The Whitman family moved to Skillman Street near Myrtle in April 1854.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n60 note" id="n60"><span>Feinberg, "A Whitman Collector," 89. </span></span></p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">The year 1855 is well known for its significance in the poet's life, and it marked an  epoch in his mother's as well: Walt purchased a home for Louisa in her own name on  Ryerson Street in May and published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in July.  Walter, Sr., died shortly after Walt's book was first offered for sale. Louisa's  deed for the Ryerson Street house was intended to be permanent and out of her husband's reach. A legally binding note gave her full power over the property "without concurrence of her husband at any time during the present or any future couverture."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n61 note" id="n61"><span>Molinoff, "Property Transfers," quoted in Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 600. </span></span> But of these three events in her life, only the Ryerson Street house would prove impermanent. Walt again purchased a house for his mother at the corner of Graham and Willoughby in April 1856, and the family moved to 77 Classon Avenue in May 1856, at which Walt shared an upper attic with his brother Edward.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n62 note" id="n62"><span>Whitman, Manuscript Notebook 4, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Uncollected Poetry and Prose</span>, 2:88. </span></span> Bronson Alcott's visit to the Classon Avenue house on November 9, 1856, accompanied by Henry David Thoreau, supplies the earliest first-person account of Louisa, "a stately sensible matron believing in Walter absolutely and telling us how good he was and wise as a boy"; Alcott returned the next day and again chatted with Walt's "fond mother."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n63 note" id="n63"><span>Bronson Alcott, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Journals of Bronson Alcott</span>, ed.

The latter, a rental on North Portland near Myrtle Street with a portion sublet to a family named Brown,<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n65 note" id="n65"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 600, 216, 239–240. </span></span> remained Louisa's home during the Civil War. Her earliest extant letters are addressed to Walt in Boston, where he was supervising the preparation of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, and from this period forward her letters begin to complement Walt's and Jeff's as the authoritative record for her final thirteen years of life.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's extant letters to Walt, which date from just before the start of Civil War in 1860 through her death near the midpoint of Reconstruction in 1873, have a wide range of linguistic tenors, from moments of profound grief to gossipy reports on day-to-day life. Because daily life generally included reading a newspaper, the subjects in Louisa's letters also include public events that range from reviews of Walt's poems to long-forgotten sensations in her city of Brooklyn. Any division of her life or letters into sets risks emphasizing some aspects of her life over others. With my choice to separate her letters into three basic periods I have highlighted Louisa's sense of domestic stability, the factor that was fundamental to her sense of emotional independence.</p>
                        <p class="tei_p">During the first period, 1860 through spring 1867, Louisa resided with her son Jeff and his family for a span that enveloped the Civil War, and this period came to a close when Jeff departed for St. Louis in spring 1867. The second period, from spring 1867 through summer 1872, could be divided in half but is treated as one period because the years are those in which Louisa remained in Brooklyn with considerable personal freedom despite financial dependence on son George's housebuilding business. During the first part of this period, Louisa endured three years of temporary residences as George's business was buffeted by postwar economic turmoil. Her housing uncertainty during the first part of this period gave way to two years of general stability in Brooklyn: Louisa achieved comparative independence—despite declining health and continuing reliance on Walt for financial support—in a Portland Avenue home that George provided. Toward the end of the second period, in spring 1871, George married Louisa Orr Haslam and moved to Camden, New Jersey. Louisa remained in the city with son Edward as the only constant presence among her immediate family, though George and his wife and Walt visited frequently, the latter often for extended periods. The third period of her letters, the most brief, began in fall 1872 with Louisa's arrival in Camden, where she resided with George and Louisa Orr until her death in May 1873. The periods so designated correspond roughly with the Civil War and Walt's hospital work   (period 1), early Reconstruction and the growth of Walt's public reputation as a poet   (period 2), and the election of Ulysses S. Grant to his second term in late 1872 and   Walt's paralytic stroke in January 1873 (period 3). All three periods are marked by Louisa's   devotion to caring for her disabled son Edward and by her dependence upon and by her   unflagging devotion to Walt.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">After an initial description of the general contours of   each period, I highlight some of the most important letters with an emphasis on those   that illustrate Louisa's personality and family relations. Louisa's letters have been   studied thoroughly for factual detail by Walt's biographers and by previous editors of family letters, so I place somewhat greater emphasis on the letters which suggest that scholars have reached dubious or questionable conclusions about the social dynamic of her own interests within Whitman family life. I address her life neither primarily as a lens on larger social events nor as a reflection of her son Walt's life but as a working-class life of interest on its own terms, one which offers secondary insight into these related subjects. Notes on immediate family, on her children and on their families aside from Walt follow discussion of the three periods. The introduction then turns to possible implications of her letters for the study of Walt's life and writings before concluding with matters of editorial policy.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                    
                    <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_authorial">Period 1: 1860–1867</h4>  
                    <p class="tei_p">Between 1860 and 1867, Louisa's life was fractured by the death of her son Andrew Jackson Whitman, and her empathy for his wife Nancy and their three children was worn down by the strains of the Civil War. Louisa in one sense was unusually fortunate: despite having four sons of military age and of at least marginal physical suitability only George and Andrew served and only George's service was extended and included battle. Nonetheless, the economic and social upheaval of the war took a significant toll on the Whitman family. During the period of her earliest extant letters, Walt was in Boston to work with publisher Thayer &amp; Eldridge, but within little more than two years Walt's letters about his hospital visits joined George's letters from the front to bring the devastating costs of war directly to her. George's wounding at Fredericksburg (December 1862) precipitated Walt's departure to the Washington, D.C., area and ultimately to his nursing wounded soldiers. The discovery that George had been injured—the extent of his injury was unknown for several days—was rivaled in intensity of worry and exceeded in duration by George's capture and imprisonment from October 1864 through March 1865. Walt's letters to Louisa provide a record of the family's emotional trauma and uncertainty upon learning that George was wounded at Fredericksburg, but none of Louisa's letters during George's imprisonment survive, except upon notice that his release was imminent. In the immediate postwar period, demobilization produced mass layoffs at the United States Naval Yard, and Louisa within months expressed her unease about crime in nearby Brooklyn parks and streets. The family's departure in 1866 to a home that was adjacent to Prospect Park on Brooklyn's outskirts may have been in response to the threat of crime. The new house, however, was unpleasant for Louisa in part because she was away from friends and the bustle of the city. The brief experiment in life at the city's edge ended with Jeff's departure for St. Louis in 1867.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The earliest letters of this period—the handful to Walt in Boston and later in 1863 as Andrew's  death approached—offer insight both into family life and the vibrancy of Louisa's interaction with Walt's social and intellectual circles. In April 1860, Jeff conveyed his mother's request that Walt send a copy of James Redpath's biography of John Brown, the abolitionist martyr.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n66 note" id="n66"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00393.html">April 16, 1860</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Public Life of Captain John Brown</span> (1860) had been issued recently by Thayer &amp; Eldridge, the Boston publisher with which Walt was preparing his revised 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In her early May 1860 letter, Louisa acknowledged receipt of the Brown biography and described two recent visits to her home, one by Fred Vaughan and Robert "Bob" Cooper, and one by Hector Tyndale. This letter has her only mention of Vaughan, Walt's likely former lover and inspiration for the "Live Oak, with Moss" / "Calamus" sequence of poems. Vaughan and his roommate Robert Cooper made an extended visit: "Fred and bob coopper was here last sunday staid till toward evening)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n67 note" id="n67"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00424.html">May 2–4, 1860</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Tyndale's visit, which was separate from that of Vaughan and Cooper, marked Walt's and his family's continued connection to Ralph Waldo Emerson and his extended circles. Tyndale's mother Sara Thorne, a Philadelphia abolitionist, had accompanied Alcott and Thoreau when they visited Walt in 1855. During Tyndale's 1860 visit to Louisa he described his mother Sara Thorne's suffering during her recent illness. Louisa apparently made quite an impression on Tyndale, or so Walt reported three years later: "[Tyndale] has been to see me again—always talks about you."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n68 note" id="n68"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00382.html">June 29, 1866</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> Two months before Tyndale's visit, Louisa had rented the ground floor in the Whitmans' Portland Avenue home to the Brown family, which prompted in her letter an aside about the tailor's "uncommon name."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n69 note" id="n69"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00423.html">March 26–31, 1860</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa's and Hector's shared interest in the abolitionist by that name—Tyndale had retrieved Brown's body from Virginia for interment in New York—may have enlivened their extended conversation.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n70 note" id="n70"><span>John M.

                    <p class="tei_p">George's wounding and imprisonment were severe trials, but the most significant  moment of family transition during the war was Andrew's death, which concluded the  extended saga of his illness and forced the family into a series of wracking choices  on Louisa's daughter-in-law, Nancy, and Louisa's eldest son Jesse. The jostling between Jeff and his mother in their letters—each complained to Walt about the other—marks a household in dissension. Andrew's throat pain was so severe during his last months that even salted broth was unbearable, and he apparently survived mostly on rice pudding. Jeff and Louisa agreed about Nancy's extravagance: Louisa objected even to Nancy's expenses for food. On the other hand, Jeff accused his mother of scrimping unnecessarily on food for herself and sons Edward and Jesse. According to Louisa, Andrew's son Jimmy ate four eggs for breakfast when "other things not half so expensi[ve?] would be much more healthy for the child."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n71 note" id="n71"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00429.html">September 5–23, 1863</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00430.html">September 25 or October 2, 1863</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> According to Jeff, dinner for his mother, Jesse, and Edward consisted of "a quart of tomats and a few cucumbers."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n72 note" id="n72"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00421.html">September 5, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Walt like Jeff urged his mother to spend more freely on food: "I hope you will at least four or five times a week have a steak of beef or mutton, or something substantial for dinner."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n73 note" id="n73"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00788.html">September 8, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> Louisa ignored Jeff's advice (and Walt's) about spending on food and instead criticized Jeff and his wife Mattie for spending so freely on themselves. In Louisa's view, they had the means to be more generous to their nephew: "they never gave Jim one cent worth when he went away not even a shirt when Jeff has 1[8?] mat said if they work and got them as they had done they could have them."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n74 note" id="n74"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00429.html">September 5–23?, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Shortly after Andrew's death, the previous aid that the Whitman family had provided to Nancy and her children—including rent for September or October 1863<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n75 note" id="n75"><span>According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, "the landlord has told them they must [move] so now they expect me tto pay the rent i told nanc i would pay one month" (<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00429.html">September 5–23?, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman). </span></span>—was replaced almost entirely by employment advice.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">In the aftermath of Andrew's death, the Whitman family concentrated its energies  instead on Louisa's oldest son Jesse, whose threatening behavior toward Jeff and Mattie's daughter Manahatta, then three years old, and toward Mattie herself prompted a permanent  separation in the housing quarters. Louisa lived with sons Jesse and Edward in the  basement, while Jeff, Mattie, and their two daughters lived on the upper floor. Jeff and Mattie  genuinely feared that Jesse's mental instability could escalate to physical  violence. Louisa minimized Jesse's outburst in her December 4–5 letter to  Walt, wherein she described Andrew's death. Louisa failed to anticipate that Jeff in  mid-December would send Walt a graphic description of the interfamilial conflict.  One of the conceits about Louisa's relationship to Walt is that she placed absolute trust in him, but in her letter she spared (or denied) him the full truth about Jesse's outburst because she would not permit the episode to distract from the solemn dignity befitting her own effort to memorialize Andrew.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n76 note" id="n76"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00431.html">December 4–5, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Jeff's mid-December letter to Walt contrasts markedly with Louisa's from ten days  earlier on the apparent violence of Jesse's threat.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n77 note" id="n77"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00429.html">December 15, 1863</a>  letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> After Walt responded to Jeff's letter—and  though Walt's letter is not extant he agreed with Jeff that Jesse should be  institutionalized—Mattie was enlisted to submit her opinion to Walt. Louisa's  standoffish phrasing in her December 25, 1863 letter—"i told mat you would  have enoughf letter reading for to day in her letter it has been long time com[ing?]  but has come at last"—may suggest that both Louisa's and Mattie's letters were  enclosed in the same envelope but that Louisa was not permitted to read  Mattie's.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n78 note" id="n78"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00433.html">December 25, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> If  Jeff intended that Mattie's letter would submit the dispute on what was to be done  with Jesse to Walt's impartial judgment, Jeff was thwarted because Louisa had no  intention of surrendering a second son so soon after Andrew's death—Louisa  would not be crossed in the matter. Mattie explained that she was "a little annoyed  that Jeff should have written you about Jess" and that before the December 4  incident only Louisa had been the object of Jesse's previous threats—he would  "take up a chair to throw at her." She concluded that whether to institutionalize  Jesse was ultimately her mother-in-law's choice: "I dont think you could persuade her to send him."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n79 note" id="n79"><span>Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, December 21–23, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman (Randall D. Waldron, ed. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 32–36). </span></span> To Mattie, Louisa's determination to keep Jesse in the household was, for the moment, the final word. Jeff and Louisa apparently settled their dispute, though no letter mentions any explicit agreement: perhaps Jeff accepted his mother's preference to keep Jesse, her eldest son, in the home but away from Jeff and his family's living quarters, and Louisa accepted Jeff's preference to have nothing more to do with Nancy and her children.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Walt had recommended institutionalizing Jesse and was responsible for doing so  in December of the following year, but he in his known letters never advocated substantial aid to Nancy and her children. Perhaps Walt too acquiesced to the opinion of his brother Jeff, who had opposed extending aid to Nancy and her children before Andrew's death. Jeff's letters from August to October 1863 signal his growing conviction that the Whitmans could take on no more responsibility for Andrew's family. George, away at war, was a notable exception  among the Whitman siblings: after he was notified of his brother Andrew's death  George encouraged his mother to be generous toward Nancy from his military pay.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n80 note" id="n80"><span>George Washington Whitman urged doing "all, that is required for, Andrews Family" (<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00348.html">December 9, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). </span></span> Whether the Whitman family continued to provide occasional aid to Nancy aside from the handful of dollars that Walt forwarded during the next few years is uncertain, but Nancy and her children after May 1864 otherwise dropped entirely from Whitman family letters. George's letters have no mention of Nancy after his December 9, 1863 letter. Neither Nancy nor her children is mentioned once in Jeff's letters after December 1863, and she is not mentioned in Louisa's extant letters until summer 1867, a few months after Jeff departed for St. Louis.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">What can be constructed from Jeff's, Walt's, and George's letters suggests that 1864  was for Louisa the most taxing year, emotionally and physically, of the war. In  early March, the Browns claimed to have renewed the lease of the Portland Avenue  home—which had been purchased by a new owner—in their own name and  intended to increase the monthly cost of the basement sublet to Louisa from $5  to $8. Jeff discovered that the Browns had proposed the step to the landlord  but had not signed a new lease, leading to a dispute that dragged on for at least a week or two during  which the Whitmans were unsure whether they would be forced to move.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n81 note" id="n81"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00432.html">March 11, 1864</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The  next week Jeff described his mother as "unwell for the last few days. She has a very  steady and severe pain, she thinks a gathering or enlargement, in the right side of  her chest. For a day or two she was almost helpless."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n82 note" id="n82"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00311.html">March 19,  1864</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> He blamed his mother's illness on  overexertion in housecleaning. Housing matters probably receded from concern over the next several months as George's participation in many significant battles of the war—North Anna in May, Cold Harbor in June, Battle of the Crater in July—must have taken precedence. His capture during—and imprisonment after—the Battle of Poplar Grove in September 1864 extended the Whitman family's worry. No correspondence from Louisa is extant until just after George's release in February the following year. The stress of George's letters from the front and his imprisonment may have led the Whitman family, collectively, to inure themselves from the poverty that Nancy and her children suffered, and the same stress may have contributed to the decision to institutionalize Jesse in December.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">In early 1865 George was released from prison, and by mid-year the war had ended.  Louisa in the late part of the year both sought to rescue daughter Hannah from her  abusive husband Charles Heyde, an effort that failed, and became increasingly  concerned about crime in her Brooklyn neighborhood. She remarked vividly on such  concerns in her letters to Walt, and she acknowledged that her effort to husband  George's military pay for his own use after the war had left her in dire financial  condition. When George arrived home after his release from Confederate prison camp,  Louisa conveyed to Walt George's fear that he might not survive: a doctor "did what  he could for him he had no medicine blistered him and gave him mercury he was  dilirious and lay in A stupor till the night the fever turned he says he felt A  thrill run through him and thought he was dying."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n83 note" id="n83"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00435.html">March 5,  1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> After his monthlong furlough in  Brooklyn, George's new assignment must have been a relief: he served as a prison  officer in Maryland. When the war came to a close and Lincoln was assassinated,  Louisa vented her disgust with British newspapers: "the english papers is very  sypathectic for the honourable Jefferson davis poor mr Lincoln s being murderd dont  seem to be any thing to them compared with the American patriot as they call the great Jefferson davis)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n84 note" id="n84"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00437.html">June 3, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> During her September 1865 trip to Burlington, Vermont to assess the ongoing catastrophe of her daughter Hannah's marriage to Charles Heyde—a trip she had planned as a rescue<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n85 note" id="n85"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00440.html">July 16, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span>—Louisa became reconciled to their stormy relationship, or at least convinced herself that it would be folly to intervene in their marriage.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">After six weeks, she returned from Burlington to the domestic routine of caring for  growing granddaughters, where her anxieties about money began to merge with postwar  financial and social upheaval. She recognized that her thriftiness with George's military pay during the war meant that her dependency on her sons had increased in the postwar period: "i dont have much money to spend now adays to think i was such A fool as to use all the money i had in the bank and save the other now i want it and wish i had saved my own."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n86 note" id="n86"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00468.html">December 3, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Criminal activity in public parks near the Navy Yard, presumably related to rising unemployment during postwar demobilization, also raised her level of anxiety. A sensational crime—a Spanish national from Cuba, who was said to have carried thousands of dollars in cash, was attacked and murdered by two men wielding razors and a dagger—produced a community-wide sensation, and a close neighbor on Portland Avenue had a watch stolen.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n87 note" id="n87"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00466.html">November 25, 1865</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00465.html">December 10, 1865</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The concern about crime in the near vicinity may have prompted the Whitmans' July 1866 move to a home on Prospect Park, then the outskirts of the city.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The new Pacific Street house, though more spacious, proved unpleasant for Louisa. She  aired some of her complaints about housing discomforts and childcare frustrations in  her letters to Walt, but she also discussed her reading, revealed some opinions of  same-sex romantic partnerships, and explained her sense of poverty and dependency.  Louisa was unhappy with the move away from Brooklyn's city center—the  following spring she noted, "I have lived in the country so long"<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n88 note" id="n88"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00479.html">April 13, 1867</a> letter to Walt  Whitman. </span></span>—and the Pacific Street house was exposed to the wind and  could not be warmed adequately. Jeff's close friend and a former Brooklyn Water  Works engineer Joseph Phineas Davis, who in 1866 began serving as the chief engineer  at the nearby Prospect Park, shared the house with the Whitmans. Davis was a  sometimes exasperating housemate, but Louisa's remark on his romantic partner  suggests that she saw little difference between male-female or same-sex attraction.  Davis's frequent visitor elicited one remark: "he has a mr somebody here quite  often to supper and stay all night)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n89 note" id="n89"><span>Louisa Van  Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00471.html">June 7, 1866</a> letter to Walt  Whitman. </span></span> But that was not a source of concern, or even interest: she was  instead exasperated by Davis's habit of absconding with the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times,</span> one of the newspapers in which she was following the  "speakery in the house." That to her was a notable annoyance: "i generally see the  sunday paper davis takes the times every day but he is so queer about it leaves it  over to the office."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n90 note" id="n90"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,  <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00471.html">June 7, 1866</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00474.html">February 21, 1867</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa's attitude toward Davis's "mr somebody" and same-sex romantic partners generally was one of casual ease. She did tease family members about their romantic partners, regardless of gender. Three years later, she gently teased Walt—"you must tell me when you write how many valentines you got"<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n91 note" id="n91"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00633.html">February 14 or 15, 1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span>—but she did not imply a gender designation for his Valentines. A year before she mentioned Davis's companion, she mocked George's secretiveness about his new partner: "he thinks he is very sly but murder will out."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n92 note" id="n92"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00471.html">June 7, 1866</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Davis's unnamed partner received the gender designation "mr" and Louisa Orr is one time called George's "gal,"<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n93 note" id="n93"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00577.html">August 25, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> but Louisa's term "somebody," even if not invoking gender neutrality deliberately, registered casual unconcern about the gender of a romantic or sexual partner.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa was frustrated by childcare responsibilities but developed an enduring  tenderness toward her granddaughter Manahatta "Hattie" and sometimes recognized humor in her own difficulties. Though Louisa had called Hattie "very obstropolous" (a dialect form of "obstreperous") when she was three, Louisa had grown close to her granddaughter over the next four years.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n94 note" id="n94"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00430.html">September 25 or October 2, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Following the death of a recently hatched chick, Hattie "buried one" and questioned her grandmother: "she asked me if i thought it would go to heaven hattie is a very smart child." Louisa in the same letter expressed irritation that Jeff and his wife had been away to Philadelphia for an extended time. The household burdens—caring for two children under eight years and for her son Edward, cooking for them as well as for Davis and his cousin—fell entirely on Louisa: "martha has been gone to philadelphe most a week Jeff came home last night but mat dident come they were to come tuesday or wensday sure i dont think they will come such a game over me again she has no girl and the work has been very hard on me."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n95 note" id="n95"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00477.html">March 28, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> On another occasion, when Mattie and daughter Hattie were away, Louisa referred wryly to the opportunity to write Walt as "A lull in the confusion."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n96 note" id="n96"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00479.html">April 13, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">In early May 1867, the Pacific Street household was again "all in confusion" after  Jeff departed to St. Louis, where he had begun his work as chief engineer, a  position in which he would rise to national prominence. Jeff and Mattie, unsure  whether Jeff's departure from Brooklyn would be permanent, decided initially against  moving the entire family. In part because Davis joined Jeff in St. Louis,  the remaining Whitmans were compelled to depart the house, which  was apparently owned or managed by Prospect Park, Davis's employer.  Mattie and daughters Hattie and Jessie Louisa planned to stay in Towanda, Pennsylvania, with family friend Gordon F. Mason from spring into the summer, so Louisa and Edward faced the urgent need to find  a new home.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n97 note" id="n97"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00444.html">May 23, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> When the  Whitmans left, the new tenants included the brother-in-law of the Plymouth Church pastor Beecher, and the arriving Bullards purchased some of the Whitmans' household goods, including their chickens. Louisa's housing fears turned her thoughts to a small lot with a carpenter shop that George's business partner, a man known only as "Smith," had purchased the previous year, on Putnam Avenue.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n98 note" id="n98"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00501.html">May 2, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> After a few weeks of near panic, Louisa and Edward settled into a boarding house on 1194 Atlantic Street. Walt, in a letter fragment that dates a few months after Louisa's departure from the Pacific Street house, speculated at this time that he could scrape together enough for George and his partner to build a small home for his mother on the Putnam Avenue lot, but Smith's plan to build there eventually quashed Louisa's best hope for a secure home.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n99 note" id="n99"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00501.html">May 2, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman.

                    <p class="tei_p">After Jeff's departure to St. Louis, Louisa endured an extended period of frustration with housing, but the respite from childcare responsibilities allowed her to engage more actively with Walt's literary career. She and Edward remained in the boarding house on 1194 Atlantic Street for about a year, and they then moved to another boarding house with a similar address, 1149 Atlantic Avenue. Though frustrated with boarding house life at both locations—her wish to have a small place of her own brought the still undeveloped Putnam Avenue lot often to mind—tepid post-war economic growth kept George's housebuilding business in the doldrums and delayed Louisa's hoped-for home over two years. It took until spring 1869 before George recovered his financial footing both by selling several houses and by coming into his own as a favored pipe inspector. Jeff and his friends and former Water Works engineers Moses Lane and Davis, now dispersed as consultants and newly hired chief engineers in eastern and midwestern cities, relied on the casting infrastructure in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to acquire their pipe—and on George as an on-site inspector at the manufacturers. When George began to recover financially in May 1869, he settled his mother and brother Edward in a home that he had built at 71 Portland Avenue opposite the State Arsenal (also known as the Armory).</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">In spring 1871 George married Louisa Orr Haslam, whom he had courted and may have  intended to marry as early as 1866.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n100 note" id="n100"><span>Louisa Van  Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00471.html">June 7, 1866</a> letter to Walt  Whitman. </span></span> With George having shifted his emphasis from housebuilding to  pipe inspection, he moved to Camden, where he had better access to on-site  inspection work at the foundries. George and his new wife soon began pressuring his  mother to relocate to Camden. Though Louisa's health—especially  arthritis—made daily life more difficult physically, she and Edward remained  in Brooklyn through summer 1872, when she acquiesced finally to family pressure and  moved to Camden. This period of her life is richly documented by her seventy-five  extant letters, which treat a range of family matters: Mattie Whitman's declining  health; the amputation of daughter Hannah's thumb; George's business matters;  Louisa's close involvement with the lives of her neighbors, other relatives, and  Walt's many friends; Jesse's death; and the trials of Andrew's widow Nancy and her children. The letters from this period provide ample evidence also of Louisa's intellectual vibrancy.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">That she was semi-literate and could not read or understand Walt's poetry is a canard that her letters easily dispel: she read expansively in the news of her day, and thanks largely to Walt's forwarded periodicals she achieved a substantial degree of print culture sophistication. Newspapers that she read regularly or to which she subscribed include the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span>,<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> New York Sunday Mercury</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun, </span>and<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> Brooklyn Daily Times</span>.<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> </span>She referred to Walt's forwarded copies of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Illustrated Chicago News</span>, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Graphic</span> (London), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Daily Graphic</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Washington Morning Chronicle</span>, and a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span> and a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>, probably from Washington and Baltimore respectively. She appreciated engravings in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Graphic</span>, almost certainly one of two ambitious illustrations of dying soldiers during the Franco-Prussian war—Henry Woods's "The Last Message" or Godefroy Durand's "The Last Bivouac."

She read avidly the popular news of her city, but she read against the grain of the newspaper's social and political commentary, most notably the political leanings that shaped the paper's coverage of the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and later the election of Ulysses S. Grant. Aside from politics, she followed the newspaper sensations of her day, which included a visit to Brooklyn by Queen Victoria's son Prince Arthur, a Long Island railroad disaster in which one of the dead was named George Van Nostrand (not her grandson by the same name as Walt had feared), the murder of a builder named Dominicus S. Vorhees, and a train disaster known as the "Hudson River Horror."

                    <p class="tei_p">Though Louisa read the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>  faithfully—perhaps a habit that she had acquired in the mid-1840s when Walt  had served as its editor—she regarded its Reconstruction-era political  coverage with disdain.

                    <p class="tei_p">For local news she mostly followed the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span> but sometimes  picked up a copy of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> or in lean periods  took a penny paper like the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. She read both national and  local news critically and recognized the casual misogyny so common in the popular  press of her day. Shortly after Grant's election, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>  lauded the Government Printing Office and Treasury Department. These federal offices  were dismissing female employees disproportionately—"the least efficient and  most obnoxious, politically, of the employe[e]s"—among the clerks and other  personnel in folding rooms and binderies.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n108 note" id="n108"><span>"Washington: The Contest Between the Senate and the House on the  Tenure-of-Office Bill—Great Reduction of the Clerical Force in the  Departments—Discharge of Female Clerks," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York  Times</span>, March 28, 1869, 1. </span></span> Louisa saw the dismissals differently,  "i felt sorry to see so many females discharged."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n109 note" id="n109"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00638.html">March 30,  1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> She was also unsympathetic to the  stereotypically feminine enthusiasm for new fashions. Her description of the new spring hats and bonnets for 1869—the former with narrow brims that she despised, "i think the hats is awful"—was drawn not from the breathless spring fashion reports but from a satiric <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span> correspondent named Corry O'Lanus.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n110 note" id="n110"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00579.html">April 14, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman </span></span> Louisa rarely commented on articles more than a few days old, so her remarks on articles in periodicals, when they can be identified with a particular story, both illuminate her political and cultural leanings and help to date her letters.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa presumably shared the race bias and demeaning attitudes toward African  Americans that are sprinkled throughout Whitman family letters, including Walt's,  but Louisa did not use offensive terms for African Americans in her own letters.  Either or both of Walt's two commonly noted but conflicting attitudes—his  toleration and even acceptance of slavery as an institution in some of his prose  political commentary despite his sympathy toward the slave's humanity in his  poetry—may have been shared by Louisa. Her one mention of an African American stereotype, which is employed in  a Thomas Nast cartoon in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Weekly,</span> is ambiguous  because her notice of it seems more characteristic of her pro-Republican political leanings than her racial attitudes. Louisa had a "hearty  laughf " at the Nast cartoon's portrayal of Salman P. Chase, the presidential  hopeful, as a physician offering a "Sickly Democrat" a medicinal draught that  consists of a stereotyped black figure, a satiric comment on Chase's doomed effort  to encourage the Democratic Party to accept African American suffrage.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n111 note" id="n111"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00547.html">July 8, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman.

Into early adulthood in New York she had of course witnessed slavery firsthand.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">One prejudice, Louisa's attitude toward Native Americans, is readily discernible from  two letters: she shifted quickly from romantic idealization of disappearing Native  Americans (also Walt's attitude)<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n113 note" id="n113"><span>Ed Folsom,  "Native Americans (Indians)," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt  Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed.

Available <a href="entry_34" class="internal_link">http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_34.html</a>. </span></span>  toward her culture's shared horror after an incident known as the Modoc Massacre.  From one brief remark on Jean Washburn's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Yo-Semite: A Poem</span>  (1871)—"the old indian tradition i think is so beautifu[l?] ¶ the fire in  the woods on the prairi[e?] is awful[l?] to rea[d?]"—we may reasonably  conclude that she shared her culture's romanticization of a people that she assumed  had been relegated to a superseded past.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n114 note" id="n114"><span>Louisa  Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00604.html">October 10, 1871</a> letter to  Walt Whitman. </span></span> But when in early 1873 the Modoc tribe under its leader  Kientpoos (known by the English name "Captain Jack") violently resisted a  peace negotiation party that aimed to resettle the Modoc people in a reservation,  the form that resistance took was beyond Louisa's imagining: "we saw  the news of the modoc massacre last sunday but thought maybee it wasent true till we  got the herald."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n115 note" id="n115"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00629.html">April 21–May 3?, 1873</a> letter to Walt  Whitman. </span></span> The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>'s truth, that Modoc  warriors assassinated unarmed peace negotiators without cause, was a racist  reduction: it ignored a long history of harassment against the Modoc people by  Western settlers; internecine conflict among Modoc factions; the peace negotiators'  plan to relocate the Modocs against their will in a reservation dominated by the  Klamath people, their historical enemy; the military threat that backed up the peace  negotiators; and the reasonable belief that for the federal peace commission the  only satisfactory outcome to negotiation was Modoc removal, which would be achieved  with armed force if the peace commission failed. Louisa's racial prejudice against Native American people was similar to Walt's, familiar to her times, and relatively unambiguous in these two instances. </p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">We can from these two passages in Louisa's letters assume that her attitudes toward Native Americans were similar to Walt's, but we should perhaps be more cautious in any statements about her attitudes toward race or ethnicity. Her attitudes may have shifted over time, evolved in response to particular incidents, or blended into fears and desires for which she had limited means of expression within her own cultural context. Louisa's ethnic prejudice toward the Irish is the only attitude voiced with repeated virulence in her letters, and one root of that prejudice was Louisa's relationship to her daughter-in-law Nancy, who was of Irish descent (see Andrew Jackson and Nancy Whitman and children below). For Native Americans generally, the accord between Louisa's letters and Walt's prose and letters allows us to surmise that she switched easily between romantic idealization and racially inflected hatred, but our suppositions are limited to the extant letters. Walt's attitudes about African Americans are more complex when we contrast his prose and poetry, and Louisa's attitudes may in part be reflected in Walt's "The Sleepers," a likely biographical passage about Louisa's encounter with a "red squaw" that  has been identified as "the most extended treatment of desire between women and also between races in all of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n268 note" id="n268"><span>Moon and Sedgwick, 24–25. </span></span> Walt's poem is thin evidence on which to reconstruct Louisa's desires as a young woman—and we should acknowledge both that racial prejudice has been no barrier to sexual desire and that verbal expressions of such desire in her era trespassed on culturally forbidden terrain—but "The Sleepers" offers sufficient reason for caution also when describing Louisa's attitudes toward Native Americans.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa, like readers today, was capable of recognizing possibilities in Walt's poetic voices, and the wealth of her comments on his poetry and on reviews of his work show that her judgment could be incisive. She weighed the merits of William D. O'Connor's "The Good Gray Poet" (1866) against John Burroughs' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</span> (1867): "Walt doo you know i like his writings the good gray poet better than i doo borroug[hs?] book Oconers shows the spirit its wrote in i should form an idea of the man if i had never seen him by reading his writing."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n116 note" id="n116"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00503.html">August 1, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Roper credits the soundness of her judgment: O'Connor's essay "was a dense, allusion-studded polemic of great power and stylistic brilliance, nigh unto an American rhetorical tour de force."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n117 note" id="n117"><span>Roper, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span>, 198. </span></span> But she was no undiscriminating fan of O'Connor: his "Ballad of Sir Ball" she dismissed—"it is signed w i hope nobody will think you wrote it walt)"—and she thought that O'Connor failed to write to his full ability: "i dont see into his writing such peices as he writes i should think him capable of writing something more substancial a man that can converse as he can."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n118 note" id="n118"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00541.html">March 24, 1868</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00517.html">February 25, 1868</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Walt's essays and poetry she read closely and even affectionately: "well walter i have the whis[p?]er[s?] of heavenly death it lays here on the table by my side i have read it over many times […] i felt as if i should preserve it for i liked it it was so solemn)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n119 note" id="n119"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00560.html">March 31, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> She read the original appearances of Walt's articles in the Church brothers' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy, </span>which were revised for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span>, and if her extant letters are representative, she received from Walt and read copies of most known periodical appearances of his poetry. Louisa also recognized Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman" as an astute analysis of his work: "i set right down and read it that Lady seems to understand your writing better than ever any one did before as if she could see right through you she must be a highly educated woman."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n120 note" id="n120"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00600.html">May 17–June 12, 1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's comments and information on her neighbors and on family and friends during  this era are extensive. In the spring of 1868, Nancy McClure's sister-in-law contacted Louisa about an effort to place Andrew's children in an orphan asylum. Louisa sought Walt's assistance to coordinate the effort, but what actions he took are unknown, and the effort came to naught.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n122 note" id="n122"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/tex.00179.html">May 28–June 1, 1868</a>. <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00545.html">June 25, 1868</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Late 1868, when Mattie returned to Brooklyn for throat surgery—Jeff and children arrived after several weeks—opened a period of significant strain for Louisa. From just before Mattie's arrival through the start of 1869 Louisa witnessed an almost unimaginable concentration of illness and death among relatives and neighbors. Nancy, pregnant with twins, allowed her youngest son Andrew, Jr. (b. April 1864), to fend for himself on Brooklyn streets, where he in September 1868 was struck by a brewery wagon and killed.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n123 note" id="n123"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/tex.00188.html">September 7, 1868</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> In November and December, at the time of Mattie's throat surgery, an infection on daughter Hannah's hand led Dr. Samuel Thayer to lance her wrist and later to amputate her thumb.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n124 note" id="n124"><span>For Mattie Whitman's health and Hannah Whitman's thumb, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, November 4–December 15, 1868 (eleven letters) to Walt Whitman. </span></span> At 1149 Atlantic Avenue (to which Louisa had moved in September), Louisa cultivated the friendship and shared the sufferings of neighbors Mary Mann and Margret Steers. The former in November 1868 lost her four-year-old son Charley to the croup, and the latter, a baker, lost her husband in early 1869 just weeks after her arrival at the house in which Louisa boarded.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n125 note" id="n125"><span>For the death of Charlie Mann, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00550.html">November 2 or 3, 1868</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00552.html">November 10, 1868</a> letters to Walt Whitman.

                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's emotional fortitude was strained and almost broken by her dependence on  George for housing and financial assistance in late 1868, but the rapid turn of his  fortunes in early 1869 provided temporary respite and, for two brief years, a home  of her own. After banks clamped down on house lending in late 1868—which led  to stagnation in house purchases into early 1869—George's business outlook was  bleak until Louisa helped to coordinate a series of loans from Jeff and Walt, which  kept George's business financially solvent into the summer.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n127 note" id="n127"><span>For Thomas Jefferson Whitman's loans to George, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00575.html">March 4, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman.

Jeff and Mattie could not be relied on for financial relief—probably because Mattie's worsening health absorbed their attention—but Jeff's substantial income meant that their occasional gifts provided welcome respite from pinching need. By spring 1871 George had relocated to Camden, New Jersey, and had married his longtime somebody Louisa "Loo" Orr.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n129 note" id="n129"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00608.html">March 19?–May 14?, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> They began almost immediately to pressure Louisa to depart Brooklyn and join them: "george and loo and Jeff insists on my breaking up houskeeping they dident only insist but almost commanded me."

                    <p class="tei_p">Having faced down the pressure to depart Brooklyn the previous year, Louisa acquiesced at the end of August 1872 and moved to Camden. Walt's offer to pay Edward's board removed the last obstacle, and Louisa remained in Camden until her death in May 1873. The promise of a private room and tender care soon proved an illusion: George and Louisa Orr were distracted by other matters, and family sorrows multiplied rather than abated. George's regular position as a Brooklyn pipe inspector evaporated in late 1872, and in early 1873 he scrambled to claim a new short-term inspecting contract for the city. After obtaining inspection work from Jeff's former Water Works coworkers Mason and Davis a few months later, George was determined to build a new larger house. His wife Louisa Orr had her own friends, shopping trips, and a briefly suspected pregnancy to occupy her. In late 1872, Louisa's grandson, Nancy's son Georgy, died, and more devastating news followed in early 1873. Walt suffered a debilitating paralytic stroke in January, and Mattie Whitman died less than a month later. Though Louisa again indulged—with Walt's prompting—the hope that she and Edward could join him in Washington and share a small home, spring 1873 brought diminished physical strength, diminished dignity in George's household, and, after a stroke-like episode in early May, diminished mental acuity. Her ability to concentrate faltered, and an accompanying palsy made reading and then writing impossible: all that remained was to bid farewell to her beloved children.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The letters that fall between December 1872 to May 1873 received the least comprehensive effort at dating by Whitman's executors, but the extraordinary number of extant letters between mother and son—twenty-seven from Louisa, thirty-five from Walt—bespeak an almost feverish devotion in their time of shared sorrow. In a remarkable sequence after Walt's January 23 stroke, twenty-five of his next twenty-eight extant letters, through April 6, are addressed to his mother. The nine newly dated letters from her in this period provide a sympathetic but disturbing portrait of her last months. With Walt's paralytic stroke, Mattie's death, the letters from Jeff's grieving daughter Manahatta, George and Louisa Orr's bizarre hope to profit handsomely by taking in Jeff's daughters, Louisa Orr's suspected pregnancy, and George's dedication to his new house, the three months that preceded Louisa Whitman's early May 1873 stroke are almost gothic in intensity and are a heartbreaking coda to her life.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The letters from this period deserve a more sympathetic reading because Miller in the  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> placed a withering emphasis on her complaints.  According to his annotations, Louisa was "annoyed by George's economizing and, more  important, loath to accept a (rightful) secondary position in her daughter-in-law's  household" and "complained to Helen Price"; Louisa "complained of her loneliness"; she "complained of her lot"; she "complained" of George's stinginess; she "bitterly bewailed Louisa [Orr]'s economy"; and she also "complained of dyspepsia."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n131 note" id="n131"><span>Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence, </span>2:200–201, n. 25; 2:205, n. 41; 2:206, n. 44; 2:212, n. 61; 2:215, n. 70; 2:217, n. 74. </span></span> But readers of Louisa's letters should keep Ceniza's guidance in mind: she "had taken care of grown children, sick children, dying children, and grandchildren for years. She was old. She needed her own place in which to die."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n132 note" id="n132"><span>Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span>, 29. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Until early 1873 Louisa continued to hold onto old habits from her Brooklyn years. In  December 1872, she prepared a gift box for daughter Hannah and informed Walt that  George's plan to build a new house in Camden had to be postponed.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n133 note" id="n133"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00659.html">December 3, 1872</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> In mid-January Louisa again prepared a box for Hannah, but the tone of her letters changed to devoted concern when she learned of Walt's stroke. She insisted that Walt convey the truth about his health: "write just as you are walter ¶ dont say you are better than you are."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n134 note" id="n134"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00613.html">January 30, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The next blow, Mattie's death on February 19, turned Louisa's thoughts to the desire to provide comfort to her granddaughters: "i wish i had a home to take them for a while." Thoughts of a home reminded her of Walt's condition as well: "i hope dear walt you will have a home of your own some day if ever we want a home it is when we are sick."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n135 note" id="n135"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00616.html">February 27, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Her letters turned often to houses also because George had purchased a lot on which  he planned to build, and Louisa's house thoughts were entwined with concern for Walt  and for her granddaughters. Though George had suffered brief periods of genuine  financial worry in his housebuilding business, he was extraordinarily enterprising  and successful: he weathered the cutbacks in Brooklyn inspecting work in 1871 and  1872, found a diverse array of new inspection opportunities from former Water Works  engineers, and transitioned smoothly out of housebuilding as his primary  occupation.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n136 note" id="n136"><span>On George Washington  Whitman's full slate of inspection jobs by early 1873, see Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00618.html">March 23, 1873</a> letter to Walt  Whitman. </span></span> But his devotion to work raised in his mother Louisa immense  frustration after Mattie's death. The new-house talk that dominated Camden conversation—which had occupied George and Louisa Orr before Walt's stroke and became more urgent after Mattie's death—suggested to them another possibility for extra income. They forced Louisa to write a letter to Jeff with an offer to take in his daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa: "lou and george wished me to write to jeff that they would take them i dident want to write it but they insisted upon it i knew walt it wouldent doo of course but i wrote what they wished) of course they expected jeff to pay a good board george thought lou could manage them but walter dear it would never do."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n137 note" id="n137"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00620.html">March 1, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa's grief over Mattie's death was deep and returned again to mind with each letter from her granddaughter Manahatta. In one letter the bereft twelve-year old enclosed "a rose that was on poor mammas coffin," and in another she wrote that "the last few weeks seemed like a dream."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n138 note" id="n138"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00621.html">March 4, 1873</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00622.html">March 17, 1873</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa, however, confined her grief for Mattie to her letters to Walt and to Jeff's family because life in Camden returned quickly to the usual track. George and Louisa Orr had shopping trips and the new house to plan, and Louisa, who was haunted by Mattie's photograph, had no one to share her grief: "i seldom speak of her."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n139 note" id="n139"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00622.html">March 17, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's complaints about Louisa Orr became more strident after her daughter-in-law  stayed away in Philadelphia for almost a week, and Walt's hope that he could  purchase a home encouraged Louisa to believe that that she might be able to escape  Camden. During her daughter-in-law's absence Louisa struggled to cook for herself  but managed with Edward's assistance: "i had a rather hard time of it i was so very  lame at times i co[u?]ldent shut my hand my finger were so swoln but we got  along."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n140 note" id="n140"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,  <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00660.html">March 26–28?, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> When  Louisa Orr returned in late March, her suspected pregnancy forced Louisa out of the  room that had been reserved for her, and she resumed the tasks of cooking dinner,  baking pies, and washing dishes.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n141 note" id="n141"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00660.html">March 26–28?,  1873</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00630.html">April 3, 1873</a> letters to Walt  Whitman. </span></span> George's new house began to take shape in early April, so Louisa  described the layout and the expenditures in detail and also proposed a modest house  that she and Walt could share. That a house would engage her mind, even as her body  was failing, is understandable. Over two decades her adult life had been shaped  by the vagaries of the speculative housebuilding business. Walt had encouraged the  fantasy in February—"if you &amp; I had a house here"—and he returned to the thought in late March, "I shall <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">surely</span> get here or buy or build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed and me."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n142 note" id="n142"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/nyp.00310.html">February 23, 1873</a> and March 28, 1873 letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:201, 208). </span></span> The modest dwelling that Louisa imagined—two rooms above, two below, and a "shed kitchen"—would if shared with both Walt and Edward have had little room to spare, which prompted her to add a thought: "we couldent have many visitors to stay all night."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n143 note" id="n143"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00624.html">April 8, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>

In an almost exactly contemporary letter—of uncertain date but within two weeks of her description of the possible house—she expressed her appreciation for the two devoted companions who were nursing Walt after his paralytic stroke: "give my love to mrs oconor and remember me to peter doyl."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n146 note" id="n146"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00629.html">April 21–May 3?, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> To designate her house fantasy as an expression of possessiveness toward her son, the delusion of a deteriorating mind, or perhaps as another sign of what Miller elsewhere called her "egocentric indifference" is unfair: she was justifiably frustrated with her living conditions.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n147 note" id="n147"><span>Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Poetry</span>, 47. </span></span> The private room and relief from household drudgery that the move to Camden had promised were the fantasies that proved illusory.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">On May 5 or 6, 1873, Louisa sent a letter that Walt acknowledged as the "short  letter," and the deterioration in her written hand suggests that she had suffered a  serious episode, probably a stroke, which she described as "a trembling in my whole  system." The next day, she instructed Walt, "dont send any more papers as i cant  read my head gets confused."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n148 note" id="n148"><span>Louisa  Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00615.html">May 5 or 6, 1873</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00631.html">May 6 or 7, 1873</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> And then  for at least a week her letters to Walt stopped. On May 11, Walt wrote, "I shall be  anxious to hear—write a line or two." On May 13, he almost begged, "try to  write a line soon after you get this."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n149 note" id="n149"><span>Walt Whitman, May 11, 1873 and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/nyp.00318.html">May 13, 1873</a> letters to Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman. </span></span> When Louisa's next letter finally arrived—it had  been written on May 13 or 14—she described to Walt another debilitating  episode: "my very brain has seemed to be affected." And she allowed herself to share  the thinly concealed truth: "eddy is very good boy lately he says he hopes i wont  die."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n150 note" id="n150"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00610.html">May 13 or 14, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> This  letter may date a day before or after another letter, in which she described  "trembling spels its all my nerves" and was unambiguous about her limited  expectations for her own future: "you must come on the 1 of the month."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n151 note" id="n151"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00632.html">May 13 or 14, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">In these last letters, all after May 5, she adopted new forms to address her walter  dear: "darling walt," "dear blessed son," "dear beloved son," and, twice, "dear  beloved walter."

That is a fair reading of Louisa's opinion, but her letters provide many clues that the Whitman family's unwillingness to support Nancy or her children may have been associated with numerous factors: sympathy for alcoholism among men that was not extended to women, the Whitman family's own financial strain during the war, and anti-Irish prejudice. Whitman biographers may have concluded too readily from Jeff's and Mattie's letters that Nancy deserved the suffering that she endured. Louisa's concern about Nancy was greater than Walt's or Jeff's, but her sympathy too was limited. A skeptical reading of the extant letters yields a more damning view of the Whitman family's abandonment of Nancy and her children after Andrew's death, but Louisa's late letters also show that the Whitman family did resume contact with Nancy and that George and his wife Louisa Orr after their marriage in 1871 sought out Nancy and attempted to rescue two of their surviving nephews.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The Whitman family disapproved strenuously of Nancy's drinking but accepted Andrew's,  and Louisa gave him money that she knew would be spent on extended drinking  binges—only self-willed denial prevented her recognizing the latter.  Louisa in early 1863 drew on George's military pay to help Andrew take a  doctor-recommended vacation to improve his health, and in late August, after  recovering from an extended bout with pleurisy, Andrew was inclined to again have  time away. He twice received money from Louisa, $10 and $30, which he  promptly spent on two drinking sprees.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n156 note" id="n156"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00570.html">April  22–23, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> In a late August or  early September letter, Andrew's wife Nancy was blamed both for causing him to drink  and rather implausibly for not managing the money that he was wasting.

                    <p class="tei_p">A specific reason that the Whitman family over the year 1863 became increasingly  willing to abandon Nancy, pregnant with two young children, after Andrew's death  cannot be associated with a single aspect of her personal character, but Jeff agreed  with Louisa's strong words, that Nancy was "dirty," "lazy," "ugly," a gossip, and  out on the streets.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n160 note" id="n160"><span>Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00430.html">September 25 or October 2, 1863</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00433.html">December 25, 1863</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span>  In late fall 1863, when Andrew's approaching death could no longer be denied, Jeff  became adamant that Nancy must take financial responsibility for herself. Jeff  rejected assisting Nancy or her children because in his eyes the cause for their  poverty was her laziness.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n161 note" id="n161"><span>Thomas  Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00423.html">September 24, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Jeff's wife Mattie, a skilled seamstress, supplemented his income from the Water Works with piece labor. After the Whitmans began assuming responsibility for Andrew's food and medical care, they expected Nancy to maintain herself and her children with sewing.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">After Andrew's early December death, Mattie visited Nancy and realized that "a crust  of bread" was her only food. Mattie then sent her sister-in-law a chicken and "a large  basket of Provitions." Jeff visited Nancy later that day and apparently intended, at  his wife's urging, to offer assistance; however, Jeff discovered that Andrew's  friends and co-workers from the Navy Yard had auctioned Andrew's carpentry tools and  would use the proceeds to purchase Nancy a sewing machine. Jeff decided then that  the charity he had planned to offer was no longer necessary, and Mattie's remark on  Nancy's future welfare seems to reflect a consensus that she and Jeff had reached:  "it seems as if the Lord always provides for the Widow and I feel confident that He  will provide for her."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n162 note" id="n162"><span>Mattie  Whitman, December 21, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman (Waldron, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie</span>, 34–35). </span></span> Jeff's last mention of Nancy  in his extant letters is from late-December: "Nancy is abt the same as  ever—she seems to have no idea of getting along—she says she would work  if she had it—but no idea of getting it.

                    <div class="tei_p p">Jeff and Louisa accused Nancy of failures in housekeeping, personal hygiene, and  childcare, and they associated her personal failings with her ethnic identity as an  Irish woman and, ultimately, with sexual license and prostitution. Whitman  biographer Allen repeated Louisa's adjectives "dirty, ugly, and lazy" and referred to  Nancy's "extravagance" and "misconduct," and subsequent biographers have accepted  Allen's assessment.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n164 note" id="n164"><span>Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 304, 306, 308; Kaplan,<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">  Walt Whitman</span>, 293–295; Reynolds, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's  America</span>, 409–410, 486. </span></span> But even if Nancy was a poor  housekeeper in Louisa's and Mattie's eyes, the combination of Andrew's drinking, the  loss of his income for her household after his illness took hold, and pregnancy  rendered her and her sons Jimmy and George financially vulnerable.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n165 note" id="n165"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00426.html">October 15, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Jeff's and Louisa's harsh opinion of Nancy was entwined with their prejudice against Irish immigrants. During the New York draft riots Jeff gave full vent to his hatred: 
                        <span class="tei_floatingText">

                        Louisa's ethnic prejudice was not so visceral. Nonetheless, when she sought to remove Nancy's children from her household in spring 1868, she took a moment in one letter to explain to Walt, with a deliberateness that suggests some surprise, that Nancy's brothers were "respectable men."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n167 note" id="n167"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00544.html">May? 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> In a similar moment of casual prejudice a few years later, Louisa mused that a benefit of the Franco-Prussian War could be to inspire Irish immigrant ("Fenians") to depart the country.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n168 note" id="n168"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00599.html">July 20, 1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The term properly refers to the Fenian Brotherhood, an organization that promoted Irish independence, but Louisa used it as a slur against working-class Irish immigrants. Louisa's apparent acquiescence to Jeff and Mattie's preference to abandon Nancy and her children to their fate in December 1863 was not final. Walt's letters provide hints of occasional contact during the next two years, and Louisa reconnected with Nancy after Jeff's departure for St. Louis. But it seems most likely that Louisa after Andrew's death devoted her emotional energies to resisting Jeff's desire to institutionalize Jesse. Louisa suffered overwhelming physical and emotional strains during the war's later years: caring for granddaughters, George's military service, caring for Edward, heading off Jesse's potential violence, and sympathizing with Walt's heartbreaking reports from Washington, D.C., hospitals—all from a cramped basement. And these strains may well have left her with no emotional reserve to challenge the decision by Jeff and Mattie—who struggled with many of the same burdens—to discontinue the aid that the Whitman family had provided formerly to Nancy and her children.</div>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Nothing is known of Nancy's life between January 1864 and early April of the same year, when she gave birth to a son, as Louisa reported to Walt in a non-extant letter. When Walt acknowledged the birth of Andrew, Jr., it may be telling that he attributed the child's expected hardships to the general times rather than to a lack of aid from the Whitman family: "So Nance has had another child, poor little one, there don't seem to be much show for it, poor little young one, these times."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n169 note" id="n169"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00816.html">April 5, 1864</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> Jeff's December 1863 note on Nancy's job prospects and Walt's April acknowledgment of the birth of Andrew, Jr., are the only substantive mentions of her or her family, and until well after the war only a handful of Walt's letters—but not Jeff's, George's, or Louisa's—have spare hints about Andrew's surviving family. Walt mentioned Nancy three times after the birth of Andrew, Jr., through the year 1867: once to acknowledge a letter from his mother that is "sad enough about Nancy, &amp; the young ones—is the little baby still hearty, I believe you wrote a few weeks after it was born that it was quite a fine child"; once to send a dollar in February 1865; and once to send two more dollars to give to Nancy or spend on her behalf in December 1866.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n170 note" id="n170"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00830.html">May 25, 1864</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00839.html">February 1, 1865</a>, and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/uva.00349.html">December 24, 1866</a> letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> The comparative silence on Nancy's life in Whitman family letters may suggest that she resorted to prostitution. She may also have scraped together a living from other forms of labor, relied on her own siblings for support, or found other means of support from a partner or charity. If she did turn to prostitution in a brutal late-war economy, it was an understandable choice. Even were her difficulties not compounded by drinking, her other known means to support herself and her children—sewing, the McClure or the Whitman family's generosity, other assistance or work, and her children's begging—may well have left her with insufficient resources to obtain basic necessities to sustain life, such as housing, clothing, and food.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">After Louisa settled in Atlantic Street in July 1867, two factors—the  departure of Jeff and Mattie to St. Louis and Louisa's return to closer proximity to  the city center—prompted her to seek out Nancy and her children. Even if  Louisa had maintained occasional contact with Nancy, the absence of any mention of  her or Andrew's sons in thirty letters from 1865 through July 1867 probably suggests  that they were no longer regarded as a Whitman family concern. Nancy and her  children reappear in Louisa's August 1867 letter, and Louisa's description suggests some period of lost contact before Louisa with Edward's assistance had sought  them out: "Edd went down and found where nancy lived yesterday she moved in the same st they are all fat edd says and dirty but grow any how he said the house looked better than formerly i was glad to hear from them i ha[ve?] thought about them often this hot weather."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n171 note" id="n171"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00503.html">August 1, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's continued concern for Andrew's family and the renewed contact in summer 1867  may have set in motion the next significant known episode, when in spring 1868  Louisa joined an effort—at least with moral support—by Nancy's brother Edward and his wife Janey McClure to have Nancy's children removed from her care and placed in an orphan asylum. The spur for this renewed interest was that Nancy had given birth recently to twins, one of whom died. On the basis of the two spring 1868 letters from Louisa to Walt, Loving summarized the inconclusive episode. Whether or how Walt responded after Louisa urged him to write a letter is not known. Loving remarked, "Whatever became of Nancy after this time is uncertain."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n172 note" id="n172"><span>Loving, "Introduction," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters</span>, 13, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html</a>.

At her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's request, Louisa sent her grandson away with a note requesting information about his brother Jimmy's birthday. A few days later, a "strange boy" arrived with a letter and an offer from Nancy, that Louisa could "take george if i wanted too." Louisa declined because she considered Georgy "a very bad boy."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n173 note" id="n173"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/yal.00310.html">October 23, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Nancy's willingness finally to surrender her two elder sons to the Whitman family—three years after the deaths of her new-born twin infant and Andrew, Jr.—probably signaled a decline into desperation. Only one letter from Louisa between October 1871 and December 1872 survives, but in that August 1872 letter, written just as she prepared to depart for Camden, she revealed that Louisa Orr and George had taken in Nancy's eldest son Jimmy—but not Georgy—in the interim since October 1871. Under their care, Jimmy's "little pinched face is quite fatted up and he seems pleas[ed?] to be fixed up"; Louisa began to hope that young George too could be rescued: "if we could only get Georgee the[n?] in would be good)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n174 note" id="n174"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.04776.html">July 31 or August 7, 1872</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Whether Jimmy remained still in the care of Louisa Orr and George when Louisa arrived in Camden is not known, and what is known about his later life is confined to the handful of traces that Loving notes, but his brother Georgy presumably remained in Brooklyn. Only one more trace of him appears in the Whitman family correspondence, in Jeff's daughter Manahatta's letter to her grandmother in October of the same year: "Mama told me how little Georgie got killed it was to bad."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n175 note" id="n175"><span>Manahatta Whitman, October 26, 1872 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span></p>

Nonetheless, Louisa maintained an affection for her daughter Mary and when frustrated by living with Louisa Orr wished that she could go to Greenport. The lasting impression from Louisa's letters is that Mary devoted herself to her own growing brood and that her children were dutiful toward but not exceedingly close to Louisa.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's September 1865 letters contrast her own life in Brooklyn and life in Burlington, on the shore of Lake Champlain, but the respite in those letters from the usual details about Heyde's mistreatment of her daughter Hannah is brief. Even during the first week of Louisa's visit to Vermont the household tensions boiled over: "there was quite a blow out of coarse i did not participate in the scrap."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n185 note" id="n185"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00461.html">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> However, two weeks later Louisa urged Walt to consider a summer home in Vermont: she recounted the low prices for housing and foodstuffs, the wonders of the Pioneers' Shops, and the glory of the R. W. Sherman steamboat.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n186 note" id="n186"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00463.html">September 27, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> After Louisa returned to Brooklyn, Hannah's health troubles and her son-in-law's offensive letters came to be tolerated as an ongoing irritant. Upon receipt of a letter from Hannah's husband in spring 1868, Louisa remarked on the artist's odd choice of writing paper and cut him down to size, "three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n187 note" id="n187"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00541.html">March 24, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Through early 1873 Louisa continued to channel some of the funds from Walt and Jeff to comfort Hannah with elaborate care packages: yards of cloth, preserved fruits, candy, and other treats. Ceniza's claim that Louisa's gift packages for Hannah have an affinity to Walt's poetry—"Whitman's poems were to him what Louisa's gift packages were to her"—is accurate as an overall assessment.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n188 note" id="n188"><span>Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span>, 10, 242, n. 1. </span></span> However, the pervasiveness of gift packages to Hannah renders the mention of such packets unreliable as guides to letter dates. Nonetheless, the letters of Charles and Hannah may be the most promising area for new discoveries in—and corrections or revisions to—Louisa's letters and Walt's expanded family biography.</p>

                    <h4 class="tei_head tei_head_type_authorial">Thomas Jefferson Whitman, Martha Mitchell, and Children</h4> 
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The lives of Jeff and his wife Mattie have been fully documented in the editions of their complete letters. In both Price and Berthold's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt</span> and in Waldron's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span>, the introductions, transcription of their letters, and annotations provide extensive records of their lives. Because both of those editions draw from Louisa's letters for their annotations, this edition offers few factual additions aside from somewhat more reliable dating and details on their visits to Brooklyn (for which see the relevant letters cited by Price and Berthold and Waldron). However, Louisa's letters do enrich our understanding of the relationship between George, Jeff, and a Brooklyn Water Works engineer Moses Lane. Furthermore, Louisa's letters shed additional light on the Whitmans' relationship to the Brown family and on how Jeff's position at the Water Works was instrumental to his brother George's eventual ability to transition from housebuilding to full-time work as a pipe inspector at foundry sites in New Jersey.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The importance of maintaining social networks may have been a lesson to which the Whitman sons looked to their mother for guidance. The Whitmans' relationship with John Brown and family, with whom they shared the Portland Avenue home, has on the basis of Jeff's letters appeared so toxic that one would hardly suspect that Louisa maintained a friendship with and called on them. Louisa was frustrated after several years in the same house: "I wish they were all gone."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n189 note" id="n189"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00437.html">June 3, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> But three years after moving out of Portland Avenue and less than two years after Jeff's family departed for Missouri, Louisa called on Mrs. Brown, who "was very glad indeed to see me got a nice dinner and made me stay i beleive its the first meal i have eaten away from home since i come from Burlington if Jeff and matt knew i had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their books."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n190 note" id="n190"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00579.html">April 14, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa was returning a call that Mr. Brown had made in February 1868.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n191 note" id="n191"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00514.html">February 19, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> For Jeff and Mattie—though of course the letters are incomplete—it appears that the break with Nancy and her children and with the Browns were final. For Louisa, difficulties and breaks in familial and personal relationships could always be mended, and she had a long memory. Perhaps her reason for maintaining a connection with the Browns dates from just after Andrew's death. She had written to Walt then: "one thing more i must say mrs brown could not be kinder than she is i shall always respect her for her great kindness in our affliction."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n192 note" id="n192"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00431.html">December 4–5, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Far more influential for George's future success was Jeff's ability to connect him not to the family of a local Brooklyn tailor  like Brown but to link him to Lane and other Water Works engineers, a process that Jeff initiated almost immediately at war's end. Though George did not take up Lane's September 1865 offer for a position at the Water Works, he eventually became an inspector of installed water mains, and his connection to Lane helped George work through his financial difficulties in the housebuilding business.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n193 note" id="n193"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00441.html">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span>  Louisa's letters illuminate the intensity of the connections between Lane's family and the Whitmans. George began inspecting pipe for the Water Works in 1867, and Louisa twice in summer the following year reported Jeff's assurance that George's employment would be stable: "george would not be discharged as long as mr Lane was there."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n196 note" id="n196"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00547.html">July 8, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman.

Jeff had urged Walt to send a letter of thanks to the children of several of his fellow engineers—the children themselves had raised and contributed funds for the benefit of the soldiers—and one contributor was Lane's daughter.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n194 note" id="n194"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00439.html">June 4, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> According to Louisa, Walt's letter of thanks to the four young girls led to an elaborate choreography in which they each took a turn possessing the letter.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n195 note" id="n195"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00437.html">June 3, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> </p>  
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The Whitman's family connections to Lane were not sufficient to connect George permanently to Water Works employment because Lane remained in Brooklyn only into spring 1869: he resigned shortly after the New York Legislature reorganized the Water Board in April with city-appointed commissioners, who replaced an appointed board that had been shielded from local electioneering. One of the new commissioners, Thomas Kinsella, conservative Democrat and longtime editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Eagle</span>, had pushed the board toward greater responsiveness to the interests of property owners, and his new position on the oversight board added teeth to pronouncements from his old editorial perch. No longer would an independent Water Board exercise autonomous taxing authority and lay at the feet of property owners the cost of installing water and sewage lines and contracting for the paving, cleaning, and lighting of streets. The long-serving engineer Lane had no interest in adapting to the new dispensation, so he resigned at the end of the month. George's position as an inspector for the Water Works—though often by 1869 located not at the city installation sites but at R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Millville, New Jersey, where he inspected newly manufactured pipe—became tenuous.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n197 note" id="n197"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00578.html">April 7, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa well understood that the new board, which prompted Lane's resignation, was a threat to George's employment and thus to her own financial well-being.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n198 note" id="n198"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00578.html">April 7, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> George continued with inspecting jobs for Brooklyn into late 1872, and Lane's departure eventually proved a financial blessing to George because his personal connections to the Whitman family remained strong. When Mattie visited Louisa in May 1870, Lane's wife Marinda called on her in Louisa's home.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n199 note" id="n199"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/hyb.00002.html">March 16, 1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Marinda Lane was accompanied by Sarah Kirkwood, wife of James P. Kirkwood, an engineer who had contributed also to Walt's hospital work, had proposed the original design of the St. Louis Water Works, and had recommended Jeff to the position of chief engineer there. After a brief period as a consultant in Chicago Lane was installed as the chief engineer in Milwaukee. Once this dispersed network of engineers is understood—connected to Jeff, Walt, Louisa, and George—it is easy to explain the origin of a statement in Walt's January 1872 letter to his mother: "What do you hear from George—I kind of hope he will not go to Milwaukee."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n200 note" id="n200"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/pml.00035.html">January 23–24, 1872</a> to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> George's January 1872 opportunity in Milwaukee was from Lane: though George declined that opportunity, the personal connection paid off financially in early 1873 when George began to "oversee [Lane's] work" at New Jersey foundry sites in Florence and Gloucester.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n201 note" id="n201"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00618.html">March 23, 1873</a> to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's letters only hint at possibilities, but an analysis of the dispersal of Water  Works engineers and the records of the R. D. Wood Foundry might offer insight into how social networks enabled upward mobility in a transforming post-war economy, at least for those who by the fortune of gender, race, and ethnicity were not denied access to these networks and to their eventual financial fruits.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n202 note" id="n202"><span>"R. D. Wood &amp; Co. Records,1858–1910," Historical Society of Pennsylvania, http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1176wood.pdf. </span></span> Another Water Works employee who appears occasionally in Jeff's letters and often in Louisa's, Samuel R. Probasco, took up employment as a pipe inspector after being discharged from the Water Works in 1866. In 1867 Probasco suggested to George that he coordinate his inspection work for Lane with nearby work for Jeff.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n203 note" id="n203"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/tex.00175.html">May 23, 1866</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00508.html">November 19, 1867</a> letters to Walt Whitman. See Roper, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span>, 357. </span></span> When George in late 1871 contacted Walt about inspection work for the city of Washington, he assumed that his own wide network of connections to engineers who had known Jeff and to former military officers employed in similar work—he named six men—might intersect with Walt's connections in the federal government and secure for him the inspection of the Washington pipe that would soon be cast at Star's Foundry.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n204 note" id="n204"><span>George Washington Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/tex.00120.html">September 6, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman, ed. Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters</span>, 161. </span></span> Walt's literary disciples are well known, but they may differ little in kind from the network of Brooklyn engineers who contributed to Walt's hospital work. Jeff's Water Works connections like Kirkwood, Lane, Davis, and Probasco by 1869 helped smooth George's transition out of the housebuilding business. Such ties were also reinforced by family friendship through Jeff's wife Mattie, Walt and Louisa, and these networks allowed George to seize on financial opportunities when they arose. While it is true that "It is not known how George Whitman accumulated so much money"—he had cash deposits of $58,000 at his death in 1901<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n205 note" id="n205"><span>Loving, "Introduction," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters</span>, 33, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html</a>. </span></span>—his access to the network of Water Works engineers must have been an important factor. George's tightfistedness, which Louisa often noted, may have contributed, but George by dint of his own energy and adaptability was able to exploit the financial possibilities that career networks offered and so to secure his rise from the working class into comfortable middle-class life.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">George Washington Whitman's service during the Civil War has been documented and analyzed with great thoroughness, in the annotations to Walt's letters to George in Miller's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, in Loving's introduction, edited letters, and annotations, and, most recently and at length in Roper's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span>. The letters in Loving's edition are primary, but Roper's family biography—which focuses as much or more upon George's service than upon Walt's hospital work and assesses George's post-war business—includes several extended quotations from Louisa's letters.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n206 note" id="n206"><span>For quotations from many of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters to Walt during the war, see Roper, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the Drum of War</span>, 193–205. For George's housebuilding business, see 354–360. </span></span> Because George's military service has been exhaustively studied, the remarks here are confined to a note on the consequence of re-dated letters, which highlights the near frenzy that long-delayed letters from George almost certainly induced in the Whitmans' Brooklyn household. Some additional detail is added for the series of loans that Jeff and Walt extended to George, for a small gift to Louisa from Jeff's wife Mattie, and for George and Louisa Orr's marriage.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">Indefinite and extended date ranges for letters obscure the fact that each  day's delay before a letter was received would have provoked much worry.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n207 note" id="n207"><span>The discussion that follows is in debt  to Drew Gilpin Faust, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">This Republic of Suffering: Death and  the American Civil War</span> (New York: Knopf, 2008). </span></span> For example,  Miller dated Louisa's short note on George's July 23, 1863 letter "After July 23(?)"  and Louisa's longer note on his August 16, 1863 letter to a range from "August  16–25(?)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n208 note" id="n208"><span>Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:373. </span></span> If an indefinite range can be  narrowed—for example, mail from Kentucky to Brooklyn took several days, so  July 23 is impossible for the first letter—the reassurance that a letter's  arrival brought, were it received promptly, can be distinguished from the mounting  worry if days or weeks passed before a letter was received. In the aftermath even of  relatively small battles, newspaper lists of the dead and wounded provoked  overwhelming anxiety. The faults of such lists are manifold: lack of thorough accounting during the hurried assembly of names of dead and wounded, vague descriptions of injuries, varying systems of shortened name forms, phonetic spellings, and typographic errors.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n209 note" id="n209"><span>After the First Battle of Fredericksburg, George Washington Whitman's name appeared in the "Times of day before yesterday" (Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00394.html">December 19, 1862</a> letter to Walt).<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> </span>George's name also appeared in the December 16, 1862 issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> (Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solitary Singer</span>, 281). </span></span> For major battles, even confidence that a son's or brother's name was not present on a day's list could hardly be reassuring: supplements to the name lists every day after major battles added to anxieties and fears, which could quickly reach fevered pitch if days also passed with no letter.</p>
                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The Whitmans' fear for George in summer 1863 must have been emotionally devastating:  Louisa did not receive George's July 23, 1863 letter for almost three weeks. She  received it no earlier than August 13 and received no other letters from George in  the interim. Jeff on August 4 wrote, "we do not hear from George"; Walt on August 11  added, "I feel so anxious to hear from George, one cannot help feeling uneasy."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n210 note" id="n210"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00419.html">August 4, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00781.html">August 11, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. According to Miller, George Washington Whitman's July 23, 1863 letter "evidently had not reached the family" when Walt wrote on August 11 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:130, n. 96). </span></span> George's departure for the Ninth Corps' expedition from Kentucky to Mississippi delayed the July 23 letter, and Louisa may have received it as late as August 17: the Whitman family during the interim could only guess at his whereabouts or fate. Even when hopeful that he was not in the heat of an engagement, every extended gap between letters was excruciating because of other dangers: poor sanitation, not wounding in battle, was the most frequent cause of death during the Civil War. Even the normally stoic George recoiled from the toll of illness during the Ninth Corps' summer 1863 expedition to Mississippi: the "deaths in some of the new regts was frightfull."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n211 note" id="n211"><span>George Washington Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00344.html">August 16, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> If we pay more careful attention to the likely date that Louisa received and then forwarded a letter from George, it is impossible, as Miller suggested, that Walt acknowledged George's August 16, 1863 letter with his of August 18. In fact, Walt on August 18 acknowledged receipt of George's July 23 letter.

                    <p class="tei_p">When George returned from war, he used the money that Louisa had husbanded from his  earnings during the war to start his business. Beginning in late 1868, he began to  rely on loans from Jeff, and in early 1869 Louisa negotiated another set of loans  from both Walt and Jeff: the latter set of loans Jeff would eventually exchange for  a mortgage on one of the houses that George was building. The speculation on the  dollar amounts of loans that George received from Jeff has been contradictory.  According to Berthold and Price, who cite Miller's report from Louisa's letter, "In  exchange for a mortgage, Jeff was paying George $3,000 in installments of  $200 per month. George needed $600 immediately, however, to pay for a last  coat of plaster on his own new house."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n214 note" id="n214"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00453.html">March 25, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman (Berthold and Price, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt</span>, 136, n. 1, citing Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:79, n. 11). </span></span> This was the plan as it was understood in late March 1869, and Walt did step up with an immediate loan of slightly less to pay for the plaster, $500. However, according to another analysis of a letter by Louisa, reported by Berthold and Price and cited by Roper, "by June 23, 1869, George owed [Jeff] a total of $3,400."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n215 note" id="n215"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00448.html">August 20, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman.

                    <p class="tei_p">The source for the revised amount is the previously noted letter in which Louisa had  advised, "if you cant understand walter dear you must read it over two or three times)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n216 note" id="n216"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00581.html">June 23, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Louisa asked Walt to assist George and bore the task of tracking the various loans, and she sought to manage the transactions such that Jeff, who at the time was far more wealthy, would bear the greater financial burden. According to Louisa's June 23, 1869 letter, Jeff initially agreed to lend George $1,000 (two $500 payments) and had agreed to lend an additional $3,000, or rather to purchase the mortgage on a house that George was building for the latter sum, probably at the lot on Flatbush Avenue.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n217 note" id="n217"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.00448.html">August 20, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> However, after advancing $2,400 in monthly installments toward the $3,000 mortgage, Jeff stopped making payments while still owing $600 toward the promised sum. Nonetheless, Jeff asked George to repay the initial $1,000 immediately by selling a property that Louisa's former neighbor Margret Steers planned to purchase. But George could not sell that property because he no longer owned it: he had transferred that mortgage to a mason to settle an outstanding debt. Jeff asked George not to sell the $3,000 property—the ownership of which Jeff claimed though according to the agreement $600 remained outstanding—and George apparently threw up his hands. The mortgage for the home on Jeff's property sat at the title recorder's office awaiting an additional $600 payment before it could be transferred. The reason that Jeff wanted George to repay the $1,000 immediately was so that he could speculate on an iron furnace manufacturer. The emphasis on dollar amounts may of course obscure a more significant point, that two of the sons who were relying on their mother to help keep track of the complex transactions were sometimes oblivious to her needs.</p>
                                
                                <p class="tei_p">The matters of high finance between brothers, which have drawn significant scholarly attention, were secondary in Louisa's life to a small remark that she made about an enclosure from Jeff's wife in the same letter. Mattie, in her most recent letter, had enclosed for Louisa a small gift, two shinplasters, fifty cents. Louisa's brief remark on the gift—"quite a lift wasent it walt"—reveals her emotional state by its stark contrast to the house investment opportunities, which are measured in dollars by the thousands.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n218 note" id="n218"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00581.html">June 23, 1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                                
                                <p class="tei_p">Though Louisa complained often about George's stinginess, a critical reading suggests that George and his new wife Louisa Orr were motivated often, if not always, by compassion. Perhaps emblematic of the caution we should observe before judging them is that many basic details about their life remain disputed. For example, the consensus of Whitman scholars has been that George married Louisa Orr Haslam in April 1871, but it is somewhat more likely that they married in March.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n219 note" id="n219"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00603.html">March 7–May 15, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The newly married couple undertook a serious effort to aid Nancy's children, as noted earlier, a choice that must have been motivated by compassion because Nancy was in no position to pay them. But their desire to take in Jeff's daughters after Mattie's death seemed, at least in Louisa's eyes, to be motivated more by self-interest. They probably took on the task of caring for Louisa for her final year with compassionate intent, but both George and Louisa Orr at moments of financial or emotional stress were willing to take her household labor for granted. Their motives must have been more complex than Louisa's letters allow them to seem, and Louisa may have had more appreciation for their generosity had not her own sorrows and health difficulties during her final months of life dominated her concerns.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's letters add little to what has been reported in Whitman scholarship  about Jesse, but they add enough detail about Edward, her disabled younger son  whose need for care ensured that he would remain a constant presence in her  life, that the usual emphasis on his epileptic fits, deformed limbs, and limited  mental capacity should be reconsidered. Jesse returned to the Whitman household  between 1860 and 1863, and he remained with Louisa until he was  institutionalized in late 1870. Roper's "Jesse Whitman, Seafarer" (1993) is  definitive. He draws from Louisa's letters, documents Jesse's life as a sailor,  and reviews the documents of his institutionalization. Roper's account  supersedes Molinoff's brief notes and encompasses Loving's basic review of  Jesse's life as well as Walt's niece Jessie Louisa Whitman's family account.  Only Genoways's recently discovered Whitman letter on Jesse's termination at the  Naval Yard has added significant detail.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n220 note" id="n220"><span>Robert Roper, "Jesse Whitman Seafarer," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt  Whitman Quarterly Review</span> 26 (Summer 2008), 35–41, <a href="http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol26/iss1/4/">http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol26/iss1/4/</a>.

                    <p class="tei_p">In two of her earliest known letters, from 1860, Louisa informed Walt that Jesse found employment at the United States Navy Yard in Brooklyn and wished to return home. She rejected Jesse's request as impractical: "Jess has got to work in the navy yard again he was here last night and wanted to come home again I told him he would have to hire board somewhere as I had hired out so much of the house I had no place for him to sleep."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n221 note" id="n221"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,  <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00423.html">March 31, 1860</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00422.html">April 4, 1860</a>  letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> When Jesse moved into the Portland Avenue home is not known—perhaps after he was fired from the Navy Yard in late 1861—but Jesse was again living with his family by February 1863, though it is unclear whether he contributed to rent or his own board.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n222 note" id="n222"><span>Walt Whitman, November 1861? letter (fragment) to Livingston Breese?, cited in Genoways, "Jesse Whitman in 1861," 96.

                    <p class="tei_p">Though Edward was a constant in Louisa's life, the scattered detail about him in letters can only suggest caution about the undue emphasis in Whitman biography on his physical and mental impairments. And the letters do allow us to adjudicate tentatively the discrepancy between two portraits of Edward, the earlier one drawn by Molinoff and the later one by the aged Jessie Louisa Whitman (Jeff and Mattie's daughter), who offered a rejoinder to Whitman biographers. According to the portrait by Molinoff, drawn from personal reports by Ulysses Goodenough, a member of the family in which Edward boarded after his mother's death, Edward sat silently the entire day playing with his dog Carlo, was teased by children, had to be prevented from devouring all food before him, and would be found "just standing motionlessly and gazing at the sky for several hours."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n225 note" id="n225"><span>Molinoff, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Some Notes</span>, 13. </span></span> Hannah Severns, also interviewed by Molinoff, recalled that Edward "had a fiery temper."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n226 note" id="n226"><span>Molinoff, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Some Notes</span>, 12, n. 19. Quoted in Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters</span>, 16, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html</a>. </span></span> Loving, whose portrait of Edward relies heavily on Molinoff's sketch, highlights Jeff's desire to place Edward in an asylum after Jesse's outburst. The Edward from late in his life that predominates in Molinoff's sketch should not be juxtaposed with the Edward in Brooklyn from more than two decades earlier. Jeff only recommended institutionalizing Edward when he was in high agitation about Jesse's recent outburst—Jeff in the same letter indicated that he might have shot Jesse. And Jeff did not imply that Edward would need to be institutionalized immediately. Loving's suggestion that Edward was a possible threat to his mother—"never presented as much danger to his mother as her eldest son"—is not borne out by any of her letters, nor Jeff's letters. Jeff proposed placing his brother in an asylum because he thought Edward a burden that neither he nor Walt would be willing to bear after Louisa's death.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n227 note" id="n227"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00429.html">December 15, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman.

                                    <p class="tei_p">According to the recollection of Edward's niece Jessie Louisa, Whitman biographers were unfair to Edward. She recalled that Edward was entrusted to take her and her older sister Manahatta "on long afternoon excursions in a pushcart" without other supervision or any concern should they be away for an extended period.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n228 note" id="n228"><span>Waldron, "Jessie Louisa Whitman," 20. </span></span> The Edward that Jessie Louisa remembered from her childhood may have been far more capable than the man from two decades later, whose epileptic seizures could by then have contributed to significant brain degeneration. When Jessie Louisa knew Edward best, he was in his early and mid-thirties. Goodenough recalled Louisa's son from the late 1880s when Edward was in his late forties and early fifties. Two decades is a significant span in the life of any person, and epileptic seizures may have led to even more marked differences than typical in Edward's case.</p>
                                    
                                    <p class="tei_p">One cannot discount entirely the possibility that Edward represented a threat of some physical violence to children, as reported by Molinoff, but the physical degeneration in his later years probably meant that restricted movements of his limbs rendered him no serious threat to those who might tease or harass him. Regardless, Louisa's letters provide no hint that he ever represented a threat to his mother and abundant evidence that she relied on him for much. Edward was a faithful parishioner at Beecher's Plymouth Church, which was at a remove of at least several blocks from the Whitmans' various Brooklyn homes. And Edward had to be fairly independent to travel on his own to locate Nancy and her children in 1867. Moreover, as noted earlier, Louisa apparently teased Edward and derived some entertainment from his rising frustration after his encounter with the Democrat. If Edward was capable of being roused to frustration when teased about presidential politics, he must have been sufficiently aware of the impeachment of Andrew Johnson—a subject of table talk between his mother and brother George—to become emotionally engaged in the outcome. The repeated emphasis on Molinoff's reported details about Edward's life—epileptic fits, mindless devouring of food, and deformed limbs—may be apt for his later years but are probably inaccurate for the earlier period. Of course, Jessie Louisa's remarks may be colored by fond reflection and a desire to defend her family. Though Louisa's letters offer too little detail for us to construct Edward's inner life, they do provide a reasonably strong suggestion that his life, like his mother's, had a greater variety of tonal nuance than Whitman scholarship has previously conveyed.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">When Walt in his August 1888 conversation with Traubel declared his mother "illiterate in the formal sense," her temperament—as revealed by his Civil War letters to her—was rendered a function of her relationship to him, as a mother absorbed into and reflected through his own words. But even Walt cannot control his own legacy completely, and Louisa's letters at the time of publication will be represented more comprehensively in digital form on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span> than Walt's own. The full range of her letters exert their own gravity: they move the center of orbit in family correspondence from Walt to his mother, they highlight her wide range of social interactions and her verbal inventiveness in spite of the grating burden of financial dependency, they illuminate some familiar phrases in Walt's poetry and correspondence, and they may invite scholars to reconsider the impetus for Walt's first post-Civil War revision to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>.</p> 
                
                <p class="tei_p">Walt's mother is his most significant correspondent by general acclamation and his most frequent by a decisive margin. Two of the earliest editions of his selected letters consist entirely of his letters to his mother during and after the Civil War, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Wound Dresser</span> (1897) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Letters to His Mother, 1866–1872</span> (1936). The present count of Walt's extant letters from his earliest known through his mother's death in May 1873 is 570.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n229 note" id="n229"><span>For a list of 567 known letters, see Ted Genoways, ed. "Calendar of Letters," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</span> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004), 7:123–139. To reach 570, I add three subsequent letters reported by Ed Folsom ("Three Unpublished Whitman Letters to Harry Stafford and a Specimen Days Prose Fragment," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</span> 25 [Spring 2008], 197–200, <a href="http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol25/iss4/5">http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol25/iss4/5</a>).

His extant letters to other family members during his mother's lifetime are small in number by comparison: thirteen to Jeff and four to George. In fact, Walt's letters to correspondents outside his family (again, though May 1873) far exceed in number those to any family member: forty-five to Peter Doyle, thirty-nine to Ellen M. and William D. O'Connor, and eighteen to Abby H. Price.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="tei_p">Our sense of Walt's correspondence is of course shaped by the historical accident of the letters that happen to be preserved and are now known to scholars, but Walt's dedication to collecting his mother's letters helped to ensure their preservation. During the war, Louisa's letters from Brooklyn connected Walt in Washington, daughter Mary and family in Greenport at the opposite end of Long Island, daughter Hannah Louisa and husband Charles Heyde in Vermont, and son George during his deployment throughout various theaters of the conflict. Beginning in 1868, Jeff and wife Mattie in St. Louis became another instance of far-flung family that Louisa's correspondence sought to keep connected. Louisa's letters many times were sent with an enclosed letter from another family member or (if not) a quote or paraphrase from a letter in her own words. Only after March 1873, when Louisa suffered her serious decline in health, would the energy that she had devoted to maintaining family connections through her letters wane.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="tei_p">The merit of Louisa's letters—aside from their biographical information about Walt and their clues to "familiar usages" that inspired him—is that they are a rare extended record of the life of a working-class woman during the Civil War and Reconstruction. The letters exhibit the emotional and social burdens of limited education, spousal mistreatment, and the ever-present concerns of uncertain housing and poverty. But they are not the litany of bitterness and woe that Miller emphasized in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>: she was immersed in the periodical culture of her day, displayed a remarkable ability to maintain social networks, sought to sustain others in times of hardship and trial, showed remarkable resilience in managing her own burdens, and had a genuinely engaging personality.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="tei_p">The latter two qualities permitted her to move with ease in a wide variety of social circles: the breadth of these connections almost by themselves dispels the suspicion that she was a psychological burden on her son. She was at ease upon meeting Walt's literary acquaintances Thoreau and Alcott, and she welcomed Walt's friends and disciples, the O'Connors and Burroughs, into her home. Jeff's engineering peers Moses Lane and Joseph Phineas Davis were her friends as well. Abby Price, her daughters Helen and Emily, and Ellen M. O'Connor were friends to Louisa as well as to Walt. Louisa  was Walt's source for details about extended family in rural Long Island, and she enjoyed an array of other Brooklyn friends and acquaintances that she had built up over four decades of life in the city. The new availability of digital resources—census records, city directories, and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle,</span> for example—have contributed to the annotation of these neighbors and friends and will enable scholars to study in greater depth her acquaintances outside those who have gained renown largely through their connection to her son.</p>
                                        
                <p class="tei_p">Louisa's unorthodox punctuation should not distract attention from a more notable  quality, her sharp attention to common and familiar verbal forms that she and Walt  shared to describe the passage from day to day—and her recognition of the  poet's ability to see the everyday with fresh eyes. For both Louisa and Walt one of  the most frequent phrases in their letters is "about the same," but she read even  Walt's most familiar phrases with care. After his January 1873 stroke, he promised  to share his condition faithfully, "the<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> exact truth—neither  better nor worse</span>."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n230 note" id="n230"><span>Walt Whitman, January 26, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:192). </span></span> Louisa demanded no less: "write just as you are walter ¶ dont say you are better than you are."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n231 note" id="n231"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00613.html">January 30, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Yet in late April Walt resorted to the familiar phrase to describe his condition, "I am about the same."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n232 note" id="n232"><span>Walt Whitman, April 30, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:217). </span></span> Despite her own failing health, Louisa was unsatisfied with her son's shorthand: "you dident write how you was particularly that you was abou[t?] the same."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n233 note" id="n233"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00629.html">April 21–May 3, 1873</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Though she may not have responded to that letter—the date can only be established as a range, and she may have caught Walt's earlier attempt to pass over details—she was aware of his unusual power of observation and for his own health would accept no less. Walt's phrase "I sit and look out" is so characteristic in his journalism that Emory Holloway and Vernolian Schwarz chose it as their title for a selection of his writings from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</span>.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n234 note" id="n234"><span>Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I Sit and Look Out: Editorials from the Brooklyn Daily Times</span>, ed. Emory Holloway and Vernolian Schwarz (New York: Columbia University Press, 1932). </span></span> In 1863, after Walt moved to 456 Sixth Street West near Pennsylvania Avenue, where he had boarded with Eliza S. Baker, he wrote to his mother of his confidence that it would be "a very good winter room, as it is right under the roof &amp; looks south, has low windows, is plenty big enough."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n235 note" id="n235"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/loc.00799.html">October 20, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> Louisa recognized immediately the quality of his insight: "you must write next week all about your new quarters how you like your room that fronts the south i shouldent have thought any thing about its fronting the north or south)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n236 note" id="n236"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00428.html">October 26, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                                        
                                        <p class="tei_p">Louisa's letters are reminders that Walt's eminent place among poets results in part from his ability to discern the poetic in the familiar. In June 1867 Louisa wrote to Walt that his brother George had leg pains, which were aggravated by much walking: "he was here to breakfast this morning but felt as if he would like to loaf and live at his ease."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n237 note" id="n237"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00502.html">June 20, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Her phrase recalls one of the most famous lines in her son's poetry, "I lean and loafe at my ease" (1855). But whether she echoed Walt's poem, later to be titled "Song of Myself," or the poem's line is his inverted echo of her familial expression cannot be determined. If the former, it is she who absorbed the language of Walt's poetry, made familiar by her reading, into herself.</p>  
                
                <p class="tei_p">Of greater historical interest is her remark to Walt about <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> during a period in which his activities are thinly documented from his letters. In her February 12, 1868 letter, probably in response to a lost letter from Walt that dates February 10 or 11, 1868, Louisa closed with a brief remark: "so your writin[g?] again leaves of grass well if it dont hurt you i am glad."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n238 note" id="n238"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00512.html">February 12, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. Cf., Walt Whitman, February 9?, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, "A Checklist of Whitman's Lost Letters," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:360). </span></span> The presence of this phrase has been noted, but the general uncertainty about the dates of her letters may have allowed one potential significance of the date to escape attention.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n239 note" id="n239"><span>Ceniza,<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span>, 22. Furness, 426–427. </span></span> If Walt informed Louisa that he was working on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in February 1868, he had begun the revision that would lead to the fifth American edition (1871–72). If so, the date that he began revising that edition would conflict with present scholarly consensus, that he took up the fifth edition "as early as summer 1869."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n240 note" id="n240"><span>Luke Mancuso, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, 1871–1872 Edition," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed. LeMaster and Kummings. Available <a href="entry_25" class="internal_link">http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_25.html</a>. </span></span> That Walt began his revision earlier is also suggested in his October 9, 1868 letter to Peter Doyle, that he intended to soon have the "new &amp; improved edition set up &amp; stereotyped, which it is my present plan to do the ensuing winter at my leisure in Washington."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n241 note" id="n241"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/loc.01583.html">October 9, 1868</a> letter to Peter Doyle. </span></span> It bears more investigation whether Walt's revisions for the 1870 edition were well in progress in early and mid-1868. If he began revising for the fifth edition over a year earlier than thought, his correspondence concerning William Michael Rossetti's expurgated London edition, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Walt Whitman</span> (Hotten, 1868), may have played a more significant role in prompting his return to his book of poems, and perhaps in informing his revision of it.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n242 note" id="n242"><span> <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Walt Whitman.

                                        <div class="tei_p p">Louisa's letters, though they shed light on Walt's poetry, are more often revealing about the unpleasant aspects of day-to-day tasks like housecleaning and childcare, which remained Louisa's burden but evoked Walt's sympathy. Perhaps most telling among the tasks that Louisa took upon herself—because it needed to be done—was to monitor the passing of a penny after her granddaughter Jessie Louisa "Sis" swallowed it. In March 1867, Sis was not yet four, but her mother Mattie was too occupied with other matters to be concerned about the penny.

                                            Walt, who from his hospital work understood well the tasks of personal care, which for Louisa at this moment was the careful examination of her granddaughter's excrement, gently turned his mother's attention from the unpleasantness of the act and from her frustration with her daughter-in-law Mattie. To the first report on the penny he responded with eager concern, in his letter's opening paragraph: "I want to hear whether sis got over swallowing the penny—don't forget to write about it." To the second letter on the topic he responded with gratitude, again in the opening paragraph of his letter: "I was glad to hear that sis's penny had a safe journey."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n244 note" id="n244"><span>Walt Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00644.html">March 19, 1867</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00645.html">March 26, 1867</a> letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. </span></span> Walt emphasized the ethics of care and struck a remarkably conciliatory note that is leavened with humor. Walt's words could not undo what Louisa's clear sense of her own assigned responsibility underlined about her place in the household, but his words mark generous concern for the burdens that she bore.</div>
                                        
                <p class="tei_p">As this introduction began with letters of complaint that Louisa wished would be burned, it is fitting to close with the dominant sentiment in her letters, gratitude for the gifts of money, paper, envelopes, books, and sundries. When reading Walt's letters without his mother's replies, one may easily pass over his occasional enclosure of small gifts. In many cases, he neglected even to mention them, which renders them invisible in the edited correspondence. Upon reading Louisa's letters, one realizes soon that these small gifts were not occasional enclosures but consistent and essential sustenance that Walt sent with almost every letter, a generosity that taxed Louisa's verbal ingenuity and that make her letters today a litany of inventive formulas of thanks. Here follows a representative sample: "i have received your letter with 3 dollars"; "i have just receeved your favor as the business men say enclosing 3 doller"; "thanks for your remembrance"; "got your letter with the ten dollars and am very much Obliged to you"; "just got your letter with the order and am much Obliged and it comes very acceptable"; "with many thanks for money and books"; "got your letter to day tuesday with the money all safe am Obliged to you for it"; "O walt i am so thankful to you for your kindness to me in sending me money at all times"; "i suppose you have got my letter i wrote last saturday as soon as i received yours with the money"; "i received your letter to day walt its a great consolation to get your letters nearly all the comfort i have) as i have no one to talk too about any of my own"; "i have just receeved your letter this stormy morning with the dollar in sometimes i want a little change but dont send it only once in a while)."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n245 note" id="n245"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/tex.00175.html">May 23, 1866</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00471.html">June 7, 1866</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00473.html">January 27, 1867</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00509.html">December 15, 1867</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00577.html">November 30–December 3, 1868</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00636.html">December 28, 1868</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00612.html">January 19, 1869</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00605.html">October 7, 1871</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00621.html">March 4, 1873</a>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00628.html">April 5, 1873</a>, and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00625.html">April 10–15, 1873</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The small gifts that Walt enclosed helped his mother to maintain a semblance of personal dignity, one which biographical readings like Ceniza's and Roper's have restored, one which this edition of letters seeks to preserve.</p>
                                        
                                        <p class="tei_p">In an 1891 letter to his sister Hannah, Walt explained the purpose of the mausoleum that he was constructing near Camden: "it is my design to gather the remains of our dear mother &amp; father and &amp; have them buried there too in the tomb that I have had built for myself."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n246 note" id="n246"><span>Walt Whitman, September 8, 1891 letter to Hannah Heyde (Genoways, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence,</span> 7:240). </span></span> Walt's wishes were fulfilled, and the mausoleum now holds also the remains of his mother Louisa, father Walter, Sr., sister Hannah, brother George and wife Louisa Orr, and their infant son. Justin Kaplan observes that his mausoleum "in a lasting assertion of self, merged their identities into his; the pediment of his mausoleum bore only one name, 'Walt Whitman.'

In the case of Louisa's letters, two of hers to Walt consist of a brief note on a forwarded letter from George during the Civil War. Three more brief items during the month of her death include a two-line "short letter," a one-line postscript to daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's letter, and a one-line deathbed note, which may not have been sent by mail because Walt had already arrived in Camden.</p>

                    <div class="tei_p p">In his list of "Letters Written to Whitman" in the<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> Correspondence</span> (vol. 2), Miller encapsulated the difficulty of dating Louisa's letters and describes his procedure:

                                <p class="tei_p">The literary executors undertook the difficult task of dating  Mrs. Whitman's letters, and for the most part arrived at dates which, if not absolutely  certain, are at least plausible. I have not hesitated to alter dates when in my judgment  they appeared to be erroneous, but because of difficulties in reading Mrs. Whitman's hand  and because of the absence of verifiable material in many of her letters, I cannot guarantee their accuracy.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n252 note" id="n252"><span>Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:365, n. 1. </span></span></p> </span>
                             
                        </span>  
                        
                        Miller presumably applied the same procedure for Louisa's letters in volume 1 of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence,</span> though it should be noted that he in both cases generally also accepted the revised dates by Gohdes and Silver in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</span>. As new incoming correspondence to Walt has been identified, Miller's list has been updated in later volumes of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> and supplements by Miller himself and more recently by Genoways (the "Letters Written to Walt Whitman" were combined with Walt's letters and re-named the "Calendar of Letters"). However, the minor alterations of dates for Louisa's letters in the updated calendars are not the result of systematic reassessment for her letters, and the revised lists of dates for Walt's incoming letter dates are sometimes very difficult to associate with particular letters.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n253 note" id="n253"><span>For example, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/tex.00172.html">September 15–26, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman. Miller does not include this letter from the Hanley collection in first edition of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> (1:369). Waldron dates the letter "about September 17, 1871," but Waldron's revised date is not published in the updated "Calendar of Letters" unless the "[September?]" letter is mistakenly assigned to the Trent collection (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:369; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie</span>, 72, n. 1; Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence, Second Supplement</span>, 55; Genoways, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 7:137). Likewise, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00429.html">September 5–23, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. Bucke on an accompanying slip of paper dates the letter November 1, 1863, and Miller dates the letter "about" September 3, 1863 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:144–145, n. 33). Berthold and Price propose approximate dates September 3, 1863 and September 10, 1863 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt</span>, 72, n. 5; 75, n. 7). However, in the most recently updated "Calendar of Letters," this letter—probably—still has Miller's proposed date, "about" September 3, 1863 (Genoways, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence,</span> 7:126). </span></span> Because Genoways' revised "Calendar of Letters" serves as the backbone for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span> letters and because footnotes in volumes 1 and 2 of the<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> Correspondence</span> allow for more certain identification of those letters that Miller re-dated from the executors, Miller's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> dates—as best as can be determined—are reported throughout this edition. To identify which date Miller (or Genoways) assigned to a letter from Louisa in their calendars is difficult, and that task has been undertaken assiduously but has remained secondary to dating her letters properly.</div>
                                                    
                    <p class="tei_p">The task of assigning dates for her letters can be illustrated by considering the most common date assignments in her hand and a few individual examples of mis-dated letters. The large letter collections are in bound volumes, so any association between a letter and one of the few scattered envelopes is now a subject of conjecture. Thirty-three of Louisa's letters have no reference at all to a date or day of the week, and forty-five letters have only a day of the week, such as "sunday" or "tuesday." Dates on many of the letters are marginally more informative, such as "16" or "26 thursday."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n254 note" id="n254"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/hyb.00002.html">March 16, 1870</a> and <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00511.html">December 26, 1867</a> letters to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Even the year for some brief letters is not obvious, and some dates in Louisa's hand are not reliable. The executors and Miller assign the year 1865 to a letter that Louisa in her hand dated "Cristmas," but I have reassigned the letter to the year 1863.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n255 note" id="n255"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00433.html">December 25, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> The most common procedure is to assign a month and year from context (Louisa's reference to a letter from Walt or another family member) and then from her reference to the day of the week or calendar date narrow the range of possible dates, which must then be confirmed to accord, if possible, with additional information about the time of writing from the content of the letter. Dates assigned in this manner are trusted when no alternative seems possible, but annotation of events to which she refers shows that she sometimes erred. She dated a letter in which she referred to Walt's Valentines as "tuesday 14," and February 14 fell on Tuesday in 1871. The executors and Miller assigned the letter to that year. However, Louisa in the letter referred to a man named "vanvories" who was "shot sunday night," which must be Dominicus S. Vorhees, a builder, who was shot not in 1871 but the previous year. She therefore wrote either on Monday, February 14, or Tuesday, February 15, 1870: her "tuesday 14" cannot be correct.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n256 note" id="n256"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00633.html">February 14 or 15, 1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman (cf. Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:368). </span></span></p>
                                                    
                                                    <p class="tei_p">I have revised the assigned date ranges or dates for seventy-one letters, almost forty percent of them.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n257 note" id="n257"><span>For eleven letters I have revised the assigned range of dates by a few days, for twelve revised the assigned range a week or more, and for three revised the assigned range to a different month. In many cases I have replaced a range or questionable date with an exact one: seven letter dates are altered by a day or more, eleven by a week or more, three by a month or more, and two by a year or more. </span></span> Also, twenty-seven letters that have not been listed previously in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> calendars are now assigned specific dates or date ranges. The extraordinary efforts of the executor Bucke and previous editors of the letters—Miller, Gohdes and Silver, Loving, Waldron, Berthold and Price, and Genoways—have made possible the systematic re-dating of Louisa's letters.</p>

                                                <p class="tei_p">Because readers on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span> are likely to encounter these letters with a search that returns an individual item or during the process of browsing or studying a small series of letters from a particular period, I have provided full historical, linguistic, and textual annotation for each letter. The historical annotation is primarily one of the following types: a date assigned; family members mentioned by name or indirectly; letters received by Louisa; neighbors, friends, and soldiers; engineers and others associated with the Brooklyn Water Works or the office of the Attorney General; publications by Walt and reviews of his work in periodicals; current events of local or national significance as reported in New York newspapers, primarily the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>; other periodicals and books; geographical references to natural landmarks or named places; ships; diseases or health conditions and treatment methods; and foodstuffs. At the level of linguistic annotation, I have glossed unfamiliar words that are now obsolete or are associated with regional dialect, words that may be difficult to recognize in Louisa's phonetic spelling, and words that are presumably errors or which because of the lack of syntactic markers may cause present-day readers difficulty. At the level of textual annotation, I have noted expansions of shortened words or abbreviations, words inferred from the physical documents rather than the digital reproductions, and words based on transcriptions in documents for which the paper has deteriorated. In some cases, annotations cross the boundary between explanatory and textual, such as when likely readings are proposed when the combination of errors or omitted words may have multiple causes: accidental omission of letters, paper damage, partial correction, likely errors, etc.</p>

As dates of so many letters depend on readings of ongoing subjects—such as detecting linguistic echoes or abbreviated mentions of topics that may be treated in non-extant letters—I offer full explanations for assigning letters to specific dates or date ranges.</p>

                                                <p class="tei_p">Editors and critics of Louisa's letters have applied various systems of punctuation-style markup to ease the identification of syntactic units of prose. Gohdes and Silver in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</span> and Miller in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span> claimed, the former directly and the latter in policy and practice, that readers deserve some degree of editorial intervention to distinguish Louisa's sentences and sentence fragments.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n258 note" id="n258"><span>"[W]e have spaced Mrs. Whitman's sentences or sentence fragments" (Gohdes and Silver, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</span>, 183). Miller applies his general policy—retaining spelling but inserting end punctuation—to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters in the first volume (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:16). For Miller's punctuation of extended quotations, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1: 308, n.16; 1:341, n.6; 2:20, n. 3, and 2:36, n. 9. </span></span> By contrast, Ceniza has defended the absence of punctuation markings as integral to Louisa's style, which like Walt's Preface to the 1855 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> creates "a flow of thought that is unbroken by standard grammatical signs."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n259 note" id="n259"><span>Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span>, 21. </span></span> In that Preface, the poet adopted in place of standard punctuation signs a series of space-separated points or periods that range in number from two to nine dots. Louisa likewise had her own all-purpose punctuation mark, which is transcribed in this edition as a closing parenthesis, but she employed her mark more flexibly than the closing parenthesis in formal punctuation: her mark is used to close, pause, or temporarily suspend a thought, much like Walt deployed the series of periods in the Preface.</p>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">Moon and Sedgwick like many others have claimed that Louisa never capitalized or punctuated: this is not strictly true, as even they acknowledge.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n260 note" id="n260"><span>Moon and Sedgwick cite Louisa's "rare close parenthesis" ("Confusion of Tongues," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Breaking Bounds</span>, 25–26). </span></span> But a search of her entire letters corpus for the most familiar punctuation marks of nineteenth century prose—the comma, the period, the apostrophe, the dash—is pointless. The lower-case "i" predominates in the surviving letters corpus, but some of her earliest letters employ the capitalized form on occasion: over time she abandoned the upper case form of the nominative first-person pronoun. She did capitalize some words, most often names or titles of people outside her family: she always capitalized "Dr" and the surname of her son-in-law "Heyde," and sometimes the initial letter in names is so much larger than letters which follow that capitalization has been adopted as the most appropriate transcription.</p>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">In any case, neither capitalization nor Louisa's one common punctuation mark was deployed systematically or consistently. In her hand, the parenthesis-style mark varies in shape: she most often wrote a very tall mark that resembles a closing parenthesis—which is why that form has been adopted in the transcription—but sometimes she wrote a short mark that resembles a slightly exaggerated comma. The tall mark in some instances resembles a vertical pipe, but the three most common styles of the mark—exaggerated comma, closing parenthesis, vertical pipe—have the same rhetorical function.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n261 note" id="n261"><span>Some marks that resemble an opening parenthesis are not deliberately shaped but an accident of handwriting. </span></span> No rhetorical significance is associated with the various shapes of the mark: all serve as a weak stop or mark for a change in thought. I have not once in her letters identified a parenthetical aside, a phrase that is marked off as an interruption. In recognition of that quality, I have preferred the closing-parenthesis mark, except in a few cases in which the curve is so pronounced in the opposite direction that an opening parenthesis seems the better transcription. Her mark signals a brief stay before the headlong rush of thought resumes.</p>  
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">The practice of inserting extra space to mark off syntactic units, employed by Gohdes and Silver and by Moon and Sedgwick, echoes the typed transcriptions that were prepared in the early twentieth century for the three manuscript notebooks, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Extensive Collection</span> (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Series of Thirteen Letters, </span>but the spacing of syntactic units is nowhere present in Louisa's manuscript letters.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n262 note" id="n262"><span>Gohdes and Silver, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</span>, 183. Moon and Sedgwick, "Confusion of Tongues," 29, n. 1. </span></span> She employed occasional paragraph breaks, which are reproduced in this edition. In one unusual case, a hand that is probably Louisa's has applied a texture of dashes and corrections of capitalization, but those corrections—which are visible in the manuscript letter but very faint in the digital images—may have been prompted by a visiting school-age granddaughter.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n263 note" id="n263"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00555.html">November 18, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> In all letters save that one, the capitalization, parenthesis-style closing mark, and her idiosyncratic paragraphing are not employed with a sufficient degree of gradation or specificity to substitute for formal punctuation. Ceniza's concise observation is the authoritative word on the subject: Louisa's "lack of punctuation forces each word to relate to the next on a more or less equal basis."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n264 note" id="n264"><span>Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>-Century Women Reformers</span>, 21. </span></span> And Ceniza's sound advice has guided transcription practice on this edition: no extra spacing to designate syntactic units and no clarifying punctuation marks have been inserted into the text.</p>
                                                
                                                <div class="tei_p p">The absence of graphic means to identify syntactic units places greater emphasis on written language as a sign system for oral performance, a script in which the reader must intuit intonation and gesture. The effect is not easily discerned but often revealing upon close study. Gohdes and Silver use extra whitespace, an em quad, to designate independent sentences and sentence fragments. Their formal texture of punctuation spaces is restrained and subtle, but some space markers that they insert lessen Louisa's authority and break apart syntactically connected ideas. For example, in March 1869, Louisa reported to Walt that she had been reading "Whispers of Heavenly Death" from its appearance in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Broadway: A London Literary Magazine</span>. Gohdes and Silver mark out syntactic units with spaces of em-quad length, a practice that has been typical for separating sentences—including those with formal punctuation—during most eras of printing before our own.

                                                    The uninterrupted phrase "i said no i would rather not" is less decisive than an equally plausible alternative rendering, if three short words are a single syntactic unit: "i said no." Either reading is plausible in the manuscript. By contrast, the space that Gohdes and Silver add between "i liked it" and "it was so solemn)" marks out the final three words as a very short syntactic unit. The editors mark the phrase as a "sentence," but their marking emphasizes the brevity of Louisa's utterance. Their interpretive editorial act—attenuating the link between Louisa's attribution of solemnity to the poem and her decision to keep in hand her copy of the poem—highlights instead of her own agency her willingness to comply with Walt's wish.</div>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">Louisa used phonetic spelling—which is characteristic of the era in which she learned to write—and she never disciplined her own spelling with the more regular forms of mid-century print publication and dictionaries. However, her English spelling is no more difficult than early eighteenth-century print or late nineteenth-century dialect. As scholars and students who will read her words on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span> may be presumed to share a serious interest in a mid-nineteenth-century poet, the "convenience of readers" is not a sufficient justification for modernizing or regularizing her spelling.</p>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">A few brief illustrations of her characteristic spellings and the editorial treatment of her written hand may be ventured. Louisa is widely noted for writing "i" instead of "I": the lower-case "i" is a defining mark of her style. Instead of an apostrophe for possession or a contraction, she often (but not always) placed a space before the "s," so it is "davis s" and "addams s express." She tended to include the space if the concluding "s" is pronounced separately in a possessive word form: it is "george s" but "jeffs" and "hatties." Our present-day contractions with an apostrophe, in her hand have none: "wouldent," "couldent," and "dident." And she added a terminal "f" after a pronounced "-gh" digraph: "enoughf " and "coughf." All of these are reasonably common spellings for handwritten texts in her era. Her spelling "doo" is easily deciphered. Readers may be briefly stymied by her "im," but familiarity with her habits for the first-person nominative pronoun and contractions allows readers to decipher the form.</p>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">One word that is frequent but spelled many ways is her short form of "dollar," which  appears in most letters and is gloriously inconsistent: "dollar," but also "dlr," "doller," "dol," "dole," and "dolr" as well as plural forms of most variants. As no regular form is ever settled upon, the most likely alphabetic characters in her word form have been transcribed. Her numbers are very difficult—I for example transcribe a regiment designation "14" that Miller transcribed as "94,"<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n266 note" id="n266"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00427.html">August 31 or September 2, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman (cf. Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:45, n. 38). </span></span> and readers not inclined to undertake an extensive study of her hand must trust the editor's judgment. Louisa's own remark about the curious shapes of her numbers eased an editor's frustration with her hand: "walt you may laughf at this figure three it looks a little like a comic picture i cant help but laughf myself."<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n267 note" id="n267"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/duk.00475.html">February 27, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span></p>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">As with the many short forms of the word "dollar," editorial judgment is applied for  names and for words that are cut away in the documents or are obscured by ink or  water stains or by paper deterioration, including tears and folds. Her spellings of names are honored—for example, her spellings "maquire" and "maguire" refer to the same name McClure—but the annotation provides full guidance and the regularized spelling.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n275 note" id="n275"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/reconstruction/tei/tex.00179.html">May 28–June 1, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Partial or probable readings are encoded with a markup tag to designate a word "unclear," and the editor's inferred reading is displayed between square brackets with a question mark preceding the closing bracket. Only the doubtful letters are enclosed in the brackets.</p> 
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">Because some have regarded her as illiterate, silent correction could be seen as tilting evidence toward my own view that she was literate. Therefore, no systematic editorial smoothing has been applied aside from some very limited cases that are matters of inescapable editorial judgment. I have tried to accurately follow her spellings of the words that she wrote, even when her spelling is clearly faulty. For some probable errors, such as "[r?]ecent [p?]arknesses," I have proposed in the notes possible readings from context, such as "recent park [me]nesses," which would refer to a wave of criminal activity in a nearby city park.<span class="tei_note tei_note_type_authorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n269 note" id="n269"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/duk.00465.html">December 10, 1865</a> letter to Walt Whitman. </span></span> Some of her spellings, the very few that accord with the following descriptions, may be considered expanded or corrected silently: Louisa often squeezed the last few letters of a word into the available space on the right margin of the page or inserted letters above or turned her hand to a vertical orientation, and when writing hurriedly she may have included only the faintest hint of a letter's shape. Letters are transcribed without comment in the editorial transcription if some hint of the usual shape is judged present. Like many writers who employ a cursive hand, she occasionally crossed an "l" in a word, instead of the intended "t," and she sometimes placed a dot over the "e" or neglected to place a dot over an e-shaped "i." These common slips in are corrected silently.</p>
                                                
                                                <p class="tei_p">Two qualities peculiar to her cursive hand, the form of her letter "x" and the similar hand motion for her letters "v" and "p," may unsettle readers who compare the manuscript to the transcribed text. She formed the "x" with two concave strokes (like two back-to-back parentheses rather than two crossing strokes), and the strokes sometimes do not meet at the expected joining point. That is the "x" in her hand and not an error. Her occasional substitution of "p" for "v" or "v" for "p" will in the transcription read as a curious improper spelling. The inadvertent substitutions are characteristic of her cursive hand because she used a similar motion to start both letters: her cases of "p/v" and "v/p" substitution are transcribed with the apparent letter in her hand and not corrected.</p>

The raised and numbered mark may suggest to some readers that the editor by its placement has designated the close of a syntactic unit in Louisa's prose. If a reader's interest is her comparative disregard for the syntactic constraints of conventionally punctuated texts and the placement of such notes distracts, please read her letters in photographic facsimile—you will need to learn her hand. Editorially transcribed digital texts share with manuscripts inscribed with ink or graphite on paper the constraints and affordances that inhere to the conditions of the available or chosen medium. Where one attribute of a text may be highlighted by a transformation into an alternate media form, another attribute may be constrained or abolished. The transcribed text of Louisa's letters—given current norms of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span>'s design—must with note markers for editorial annotation interrupt the textual representation somewhere. Notes have been placed at a position which in the editor's judgment is most apt for the note's content. Placement coincides often with the close of a named entity, often with the conclusion of an abstract or specific reference that is deemed to merit or benefit from explanatory annotation, and sometimes with the close of a probable syntactic unit. Inevitably, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman Archive</span> will be redesigned and may at that time permit varieties of note styling quite different from the capabilities and limits of today's editorial infrastructure or digital viewers or devices.</p>

The transcriptions of the 144 letters in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Extensive Collection</span> (Trent Collection, Duke University–Rubenstein Library) and the fourteen letters in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Series of Thirteen Letters </span>plus her letter on Hannah's November 10, 1868 letter (Walt Whitman Collection, University of Texas–Ransom Center) have also been proofread silently against the original documents.

The most common reason for the divergence between the edited text and Louisa's text in the digital image is that one can, during the examination of original documents, rotate the manuscript book, closely review text along edges and folds, and identify ink or pencil markings that are so faint as to be invisible or doubtful in the digital reproductions.</p>

Bucke's dates on the manuscripts served often as letter dates in Miller's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, so they have been reproduced and transcribed as editorial notes or recorded in explanatory notes.

Indispensable support was provided by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, which prepared digital images and granted to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Archive</span> permission to publish all letters from the Trent Collection. A generous grant for the project Walt Whitman and Reconstruction from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">National Historical Publications and Records Commission</span> enabled transcription and on-site proofreading at Duke University. Digital images and permission to reproduce letters have also been provided by the following libraries and institutions: Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas; Library of Congress; Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Yale University; and Albert H. Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. Two colleagues at Kent State University were indispensable: assistant editor Felicia L. Wetzig, who prepared most initial transcriptions and annotations and assisted with the majority of the first round of oral proofreading, and Cathy Tisch in the Institute for Bibliography and Editing, who assisted with oral and silent proofreading after annotation, double-checking corrections, and many tasks of clerical processing. Again indispensable are Kenneth M. Price—who first suggested the project to me and who shared generously his deep familiarity with Whitman scholarship and his keen editorial eye—and the staff of the<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"> Whitman Archive</span>, especially Elizabeth Lorang.

Price and Dennis Berthold); and Joel L. Myerson's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: A Descriptive Bibliography</span> exceed the bounds of scholarly citation. The following named persons provided significant contributions to proofreading, annotation, or guidance on individual matters: Laura Weakly, Natalie Raabe, Heather Kaley, Cathryn Humes, Zachary King, Will Hansen, Debby Applegate, Matt Cohen, Randall McCleod, Linda McCurdy, Valentino Zullo, Murray Goldstone, Debby Painter, and Sigrid Pohl Perry. Many are the debts to librarians at previously named institutions, especially Kent State and Duke University. All errors I claim as my own. The editorial work on these letters is dedicated to three twenty-first century mothers, Natalie Raabe, Margaret "Peggy" Ashner, and Molly Raabe, and to the working-class mothers whose letters are not preserved in library or museum archives.</p>
