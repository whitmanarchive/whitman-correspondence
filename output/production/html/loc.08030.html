            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps the best self-news to send you is that I have to-day got out (little but decided) 
                in the open air on wheel chair propell'd by Warry—the first time 
                for four months—was so confused &amp; blinded &amp; excited tho', I soon came back &amp; have been unsettled since—but 
                am now feeling easier—the sculptor f'm N Y is here &amp; begins on me to-morrow—
