                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was a translator and poet from France who commented positively not only on
                    Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and

                    Whitman had asked both William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make
                    an abstract in English of it (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of <a href="loc.07567">January 22, 1889</a>, and to Bucke of <a href="loc.07572">January 27, 1889</a>). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
