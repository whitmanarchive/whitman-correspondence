                From every point of view, I don't see that anything of more worth could be added to
                the hoard of—1. An American, 2. A book-lover, 3. A devotee of the great, the

                good fortune it is to be your friend, your contemporary, your appreciative student and reader.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You have indeed done well, in thus bringing together, under one cover &amp; in this
                striking and unique shape, all your life-work<a href="#n4195" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4195">2</a>. There is no book just like this,

                everywhere. Moreover, as a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">book</span> merely, the most famous
                bibliophile—with the famous binders &amp; printers, &amp; a mine of wealth, to
                aid him—could not get up a volume so notable &amp; so sure of ever-growing

            <p class="tei_p">For the regard, the affection, which convoyed your noble argosy to this my

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
