                    what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
                    would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
                    investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
                    impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
                    "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
                    readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching

                    18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a
                    relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by early Whitman scholarship,
                    in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in the first six volumes of
                    Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>—though
                    it does appear frequently in the last three volumes, which were published only
                    in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son"
                    (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H.
                    Johnston), but the relationship between the two also had a romantic, erotic
                    charge to it. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Garland Publishing, 1998). Eva M. Westcott (1857–1939) was a teacher in
                    New Jersey. She married Harry Lamb Stafford on June 25, 1883, and together they
                    had three children. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">13. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07319_n6 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07319_n6"><span>Frank Warren Fritzinger
                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
