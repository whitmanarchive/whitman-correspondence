            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came this morning, &amp; as I think my loving boy is so touchy <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  it, (he says he has writ <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">three</span> letters, but I can't make out but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">two</span>) I will sit right down &amp; send him a letter. I am feeling well—only as I was out with some friends Sunday night, I was foolish enough to take a good strong drink, &amp; eat a couple of slices of rich cake late at night—&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I shan't do any thing of the kind again</span>. But I am pretty well, dear son, &amp; feel more able &amp; sassy every day—&amp; we will have some good times yet. Harry, I don't know the particulars about the Herbert scrape, but you must let up on him—I suspect you said something pretty tantalizing before he <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="called​ ">call'd</span>​  you that—Let it go—Of course I shan't say any thing about it to any one—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">There is quite a stir here in Camden to-day as the 6th New Jersey <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Regiment​ ">Reg't.</span>​  is coming home this afternoon or evening, &amp; they are going to give the boys a reception &amp; sort of supper. A good many of the young fellows are friends of mine—I am invited, but it will be too boisterous for me, &amp; I shan't go—If you was here you should go, as it would suit you.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish I was down by the pond to-day for a couple of hours, to strip &amp; have a good bath—It is very close &amp; hot here—</p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">There is a great rush now to the country—every train most is full—it is quite a sight to go to the ferry, Philadelphia side, &amp; see the stream of people, men, women &amp; children, old &amp; young, some really funny characters—I go once in a while &amp; take a look at the sight—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We are all well—as soon as I finish this I shall go out for a couple of hours before dinner—(it is now between 11 and 12)—</p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">Here is an item about your old friend Mr Moore, of Bingham's school &amp; printing office:</p>
                
            <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_floatingText tei_floatingText_rend_flat"><p class="tei_p">Henry W. Moore, Esq., formerly of the Philotechnic Institution of this city, and at present a resident of St. Louis, has been spending a few days with his friends in this vicinity, leaving Wednesday night for home. He intends departing, in company with Mrs. M., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nee</span> Vandergrift, one of our former school teachers, for Venezuela shortly, in the interest of St. Louis merchants.</p></span></span></span>
                
            <p class="tei_p">And here is one about the little girl that was run over, &amp; your father picked up &amp; carried home:</p>
                
            <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_floatingText tei_floatingText_rend_flat"><p class="tei_p">Monday morning about 11 o'clock Lizzie Linkenheil, 6 years of age, living at 126 Market street, was run over in front of her home by a farmer's Sheldon wagon, loaded with truck, and instantly killed. George Sheer, the driver, was taken into custody and released afterwards by the Coroner. The child's father is a member of the 6th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New Jersey​ ">N. J.</span>​  Regiment, and was absent with the command at the time.</p></span></span></span>
                
            <p class="tei_p">And here is one about your old Woodbury friend, I suppose</p>
                
            <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_floatingText tei_floatingText_rend_flat"><p class="tei_p">The residence of Mr. Barber, editor of the Woodbury <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Constitution</span>, at Woodbury, was discovered to be on fire about 9½ o'clock Sunday morning, and damaged to the extent of $1,000. The good folks of that delightful little place were about proceeding to church when the alarm was given, but they turned in nobly to save the furniture, which was removed little damaged.</p></span></span></span>
                
            <p class="tei_p">Good bye for a couple of days, my own loving boy. I shall look for you Thursday—</p>

            </span>
        
            <p class="tei_p">Harry, I want you to tell (above every one) your mother and father I have written to you &amp; that I send them my love particular, &amp; I will be down again one of these days—</p>
