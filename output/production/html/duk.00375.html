            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> received you letter of Oct 7th &amp; here I am about to write you a reply.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Times here have been rather busy Together with the Mass meetings &amp; a Bridial Tour that lasted a week. This was not any of my own luck but to accompany the newly married set was all  I was on the Company. I have received only this letter Oct 7th &amp; one writen to My Father of which both reached me the same mail. One came to me from the Regiment that one I answered &amp; a reply came to me. I intend to Answer all of your Kind letters. But this one I have neglected on account of my being a way from home so long. My letter to you at the time I was Poisoned has has not affected me any that time I looked the whole City of Washington over to find you—but I looked in vain</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My foot is quite well so much so that one can not tell of my being hit there. Shortly after I came to the city again to be Mounted on a Horse &amp; we layed in the Defences of Washington the time the Rebels came to attack the City. Then I went up the Shanandoah Valley untill the 24 day of August where I was Discharged. There was some very heavy fighting up there under Phil Sheridan<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; perhaps he has warmed the Johnnys since then. This Charles Davis I have not heard from since he left for home on a Furlough<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>. Wether he came back or not I can not tell</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Uncle you gave me one of your Photographs &amp; I shall always carry it with me in Remembrance of a Kind Friend &amp; one who I have thought a good deal off.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope that you will over look this neglect of mine in not writing you before this. This is rather bad writing any how &amp; I am a fraid you will bother yourself in reading what I have scribbled. My health is very good at present  Also the same I wish to you My best wishes gose with this to you</p>

               <span class="tei_salute">Yours very Respectfully</span>

                    Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the war and met Whitman in
                    Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
                    corresponded with him. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24, 1864,
                    he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was
                    renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On March 5, 1875,
                    Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I
                    would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore.
                    what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on August 16,
                    1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California. Eleven
                    letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection at Duke University. He is also
                    mentioned in Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During War</span>; Richard

                    [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134. The year is confirmed by the
                    reference to Farwell's letter of March 5, 1875 (Trent Collection). (For
