                    500 acres in what is now the center of Brooklyn. The designer for the park was
                    Calvert Vaux (1824–1895), and the chief architect was Frederick Law
                    Olmsted (1822[?]–1893). Work began in 1859 and continued after the
                    interruption of the Civil War. In 1868, when this letter was written, the
                    realization of Vaux's design was nearly complete, and the park was already quite
                    popular. It stretched to the city's eastern boundary. The park is notable for
                    its Long Meadow, "a classic passage of pastoral scenery with gracefully
                    modulated terrain of greensward, scattered groves of trees, and indefinite
                    boundaries that create a sense of unlimited space" (Charles E. Beveridge,

                    <p class="tei_p">George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                        George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                        the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of
                        Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of
                        Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn
                        and began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and
                        later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
                        inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on George,
                        see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r12">back</a>]</li><li id="n16">14. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00546_n16 note" id="duk.00546_n16"><span>The conclusion of the
                    phrase is written in the upper right margin. Whether Walt Whitman made a short
                    visit to Brooklyn in early July for the holiday is not known, but it is unlikely
                    that he visited in early July because Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her <a href="duk.00547">July 8, 1868</a> letter wrote that "we have all lived
                    through the 4th." In any case, Walt did not take his usual extended leave of
                    absence in 1868 until the autumn (see his <a href="tex.00188">September 7,
                        1868</a> letter to Louisa). </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li></ul>
