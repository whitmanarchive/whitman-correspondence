                    James and Julia Stilwell, was evidently killed at Culpeper, Virginia, about the
                    time that James was wounded, for Julia Stilwell wrote to Whitman about both
                    brothers on <a href="nyp.00147">October 13, 1867</a>. Whitman was mistaken
                    about the body, however, since, according to this letter, members of the family
                    had been refused a pass to Culpeper. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
