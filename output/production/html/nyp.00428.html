            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still here &amp; am well as usual—have just returned from some twelve days
                down in the Jersey woods where I like to go this time of
                year (I believe I have told you about it)—Plenty of woods here in Jersey &amp;
                plenty of sea-shore—&amp; I like them both—&amp; get a good deal of
                comfort out of them both—Things are going on pretty much the same with me as
                when I last wrote—that was an awful affair on the river, &amp; I tell you I
                looked over the lists of names the next two or three days with fear &amp;
                trembling—I dont seem to remember Wm Hardy you mention—but I dare say I knew him
                among the men, poor fellow—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is now late Sunday afternoon, been a very hot day here, &amp; there is just now a
                lively little thunderstorm coming on, (&amp; over almost as soon as on)—I must
                finish my letter quickly, for I must go the P.O. here as it shuts at 6
                Sundays—Tommy, dear boy, this is only an apology for a letter but it will show
                that I bear you in mind &amp; all the rest too—I shall be on there at the
                Asylum this summer—not perhaps for a long visit, but for two or three
                    weeks—I am having some work to do this summer
                at writing—I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  the
                paper—good luck to you if you run on the 28th—Tom, I must end—love
                to you &amp; the same to all the boys—&amp; girls too—</p>
