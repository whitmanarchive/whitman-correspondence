            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter of March 28—you must have had rather a dreary time this winter, the cold &amp; storms, 
                &amp; being left so much alone—but now I think the spring is upon us, 
                &amp; I think it will be pleasant enough there all summer—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear mother, I have not much to write this time—I am feeling very well—no trouble in the head, nor any thing, so far—I get along very well in my boarding house—the landlady is a young woman, from New York State—but she works in the Treasury 
                &amp; leaves things to her servants, black women—I like her very well—&amp; the place is probably as good a one as I could get—In the Office every thing is just the same—Ashton expects to leave next May or June.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">We have had very pleasant weather here this week—only sometimes the dust is bad—I went to the Hospital Sunday &amp; shall go again this afternoon—Kephart, that had bleeding at the lungs, 
                &amp; pneumonia, is quite recovered—when I came away, he walked out a few blocks with me—there are one or two pretty bad cases that I go to see, yet—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Washington is filled with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">darkies</span>—the men &amp; children &amp; wenches swarm in all directions—(I am not sure but the North is like the man that won the elephant in a raffle)—I was glad you wrote about the little girls—Tell Hattie and sis Uncle Walt sends his love to them, 
                &amp; is coming home to see them.
            </p>
