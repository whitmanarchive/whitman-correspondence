                    as the "big book," was published by the poet himself—in an arrangement
                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span>—in December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made
                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
