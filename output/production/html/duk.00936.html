            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs came this morning &amp; welcome—Nothing very different here—much the
                same with me in health &amp;c:—am feeling at the best I am capable of these
                times (&amp; that is poor enough)—had a fresh egg &amp; nice biscuit &amp;
                coffee for my breakfast—sleep fairly yet—Warren is still with me &amp; is very kind &amp;
                good—gives me first rate massages, (twice a day)—Harry is quite unwell—the stomach seems to have given
                out, obstinately &amp; badly, &amp; there are other bad features—but H is
                young, good-spirited &amp; the spring of year is at hand—all favorable points
                to threaten'd or incipient sickness—Mrs: D[avis] is well
                &amp; smiling as usual—all send love &amp; best remembrance to you—as I
                do too—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send the Camden "Morning News" of this mn'g wh' has a piece ab't me—the English register'd envelope, tho' common
                enough, will be one of the curios for y'r stamp collection—Ed, the little
                dinner b'k is a present to you, &amp; is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> to be paid for—Do you remember Harry Stafford—He is quite sick—has fits of being out of his
                mind—his wife has a new baby boy—Mrs: Somers's husband is dead &amp; buried—a
                young RR friend Elwood Mills (consumption) was buried a few
                days ago, Warren's friend—you remember Florence over in
                Phila? She has a fine little red-headed baby boy—So the contrast—birth
                &amp; life—just here I receive a beautiful bunch of great white lilies, sent
                me f'm Bermuda—Ed, when a fellow learns he knows little or nothing in reality,
                the old Socratic rule was, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">he was beginning to learn the very
                    best</span>—God bless you, boy—</p>
