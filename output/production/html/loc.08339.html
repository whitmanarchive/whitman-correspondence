                the newer more completed ed'n L of G to send, but as that has been
                postponed still further I have sent a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> with Democratic

                to day—thanks—Traubel well—Mrs: D[avis] has had a ten days illness, seems
