                        A Critical Essay</span> (1868), Swinburne pointed out similarities between
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His
                    famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs
