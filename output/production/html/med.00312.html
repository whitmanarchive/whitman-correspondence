                has come &amp; is now lying before me. I thank you deeply. I am very well, this summer, &amp; go to the Hospitals daily &amp; nightly—as I find a greater proportion of sad cases than ever—&amp; for some reason or other there are few or no visitors. I enjoy my visits with a sad but profound joy &amp; satisfaction—especially at night, when the light is nearly turned off, &amp; I am soothing some suffering one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you, same mail with this, two copies of the little book Drum-Taps. Farewell.</p>
