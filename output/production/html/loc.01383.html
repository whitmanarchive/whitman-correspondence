                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    Whitman of events in the family: Alys was to attend Bryn Mawr College in the
                    fall, Logan was studying at Oxford, and Mary had a second child. Robert's wife
                    Hannah wrote on <a href="loc.03713">March 13</a> to Whitman about her
                    granddaughter's birth (see also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Smith Alumnae Quarterly</span>
                    [February, 1958], p. 88). Hannah was no admirer of the poet, and Whitman once
                    said of her: "She still believes that the world is to be persuaded, driven into
                    salvation. I do not—never did!" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
