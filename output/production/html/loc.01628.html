            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">You will be surprised to get a letter from me away off here—I have been taking
                quite a journey the last two months—have been out to the Rocky Mountains and
                Colorado (2000 miles)—(Seems to me I sent you a paper six weeks ago from
                Denver)—I got along very well till about three weeks ago when I was taken sick
                &amp; disabled, &amp; hauled in here in St Louis for repairs, have been here ever
                since—am fixed comfortable—Still somewhat under the weather, (but have
                no doubt I shall be well as usual for me before long)—Shall stay here probably
                two or three weeks longer, &amp; then back east to Camden—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete this is a wonderful country out here, &amp; no one knows how big it is till he
                launches out in the midst of it—But there are plenty of hard-up fellows in
                this city &amp; out in the mines, &amp; all over here—you have no idea how
                many run ashore, get sick from exposure, poor grub &amp;c—many young men, some
                old chaps, some boys of 15 or 16—I met them every where, especially at the RR
                stoppings, out of money &amp; trying to get home—But the general run of all
                these Western places, city &amp; country is very prosperous, on the rush, plenty of
                people, plenty to eat, &amp; apparently plenty of money—Colorado you know is
                getting to be the great silver land of the world—In Denver I visited a big
                smelting establishment, purifying the ore, goes through many processes—takes a week—well they showed me silver
                there by the cart load—Then in middle Colorado, in one place, as we stopt in a
                mining camp I saw rough bullion bars piled up in stacks outdoors five <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01628.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01628.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01628.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> or six feet high
                like hay cocks—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—So it is—a few make great strikes—like the prizes in the
                lottery—but most are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blanks</span>—I was at Pike's
                Peak—I liked Denver City very much—But the most interesting part of my
                travel has been <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the Plains</span>, (the great American <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Desert</span> the old geographies call it, but it is no desert)
                largely through Colorado &amp; Western Kansas, all flat, hundreds &amp; even
                thousands of miles—some real good, nearly all pretty fair soil, all for stock
                raising, thousands of herds of cattle, some very large—the herdsmen, (the
                principal common employment) a wild hardy race, always on horseback, they call 'em
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cow-boys</span> altogether—I used to like to get among
                them &amp; talk with them—I stopt some days at a town right in the middle of
                those Plains, in Kansas, on the Santa Fe road—found a soldier there who had known me in the war 15 years ago—was
                married &amp; running the hotel there—I had hard work to get away from
                him—he wanted me to stay all winter—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The picture at the beginning of this letter is the St Louis bridge over the
                Mississippi river—I often go down to the river, or
                across this bridge—it is one of my favorite sights—but the air of this
                city don't agree with me—I have not had a well day, (even for me,) since I
                have been here—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Well Pete dear boy I guess I have written enough—How are you getting along?
                I often think of you &amp; no doubt you often do of me—God bless you, my
                darling friend, &amp; however it goes, you must try to keep up a good
                heart—for I do—</p>
