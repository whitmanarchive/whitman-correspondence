            <p class="tei_p">You will be surprised to get a letter from me away off here—I have been taking
                quite a journey the last two months—have been out to the Rocky Mountains and
                Colorado (2000 miles)—(Seems to me I sent you a paper six weeks ago from
                Denver)—I got along very well till about three weeks ago when I was taken sick
                &amp; disabled, &amp; hauled in here in St Louis for repairs, have been here ever
                since—am fixed comfortable—Still somewhat under the weather, (but have
                no doubt I shall be well as usual for me before long)—Shall stay here probably
                two or three weeks longer, &amp; then back east to Camden—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete this is a wonderful country out here, &amp; no one knows how big it is till he
                launches out in the midst of it—But there are plenty of hard-up fellows in
                this city &amp; out in the mines, &amp; all over here—you have no idea how
                many run ashore, get sick from exposure, poor grub &amp;c—many young men, some
                old chaps, some boys of 15 or 16—I met them every where, especially at the RR
                stoppings, out of money &amp; trying to get home—But the general run of all
                these Western places, city &amp; country is very prosperous, on the rush, plenty of
                people, plenty to eat, &amp; apparently plenty of money—Colorado you know is
                getting to be the great silver land of the world—In Denver I visited a big
                smelting establishment, purifying the ore, goes through many processes<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—takes a week—well they showed me silver
                there by the cart load—Then in middle Colorado, in one place, as we stopt in a
                mining camp I saw rough bullion bars piled up in stacks outdoors five <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01628.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01628.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01628.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01628.003_large.jpg</span> or six feet high

            <p class="tei_p">—So it is—a few make great strikes—like the prizes in the
                lottery—but most are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blanks</span>—I was at Pike's
                Peak—I liked Denver City very much—But the most interesting part of my
                travel has been <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the Plains</span>, (the great American <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Desert</span> the old geographies call it, but it is no desert)
                largely through Colorado &amp; Western Kansas, all flat, hundreds &amp; even
                thousands of miles—some real good, nearly all pretty fair soil, all for stock
                raising, thousands of herds of cattle, some very large—the herdsmen, (the
                principal common employment) a wild hardy race, always on horseback, they call 'em
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">cow-boys</span> altogether—I used to like to get among
                them &amp; talk with them—I stopt some days at a town right in the middle of
                those Plains, in Kansas, on the Santa Fe road—found a soldier<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> there who had known me in the war 15 years ago—was
                married &amp; running the hotel there—I had hard work to get away from
                him—he wanted me to stay all winter—</p>

                across this bridge—it is one of my favorite sights—but the air of this
                city don't agree with me—I have not had a well day, (even for me,) since I
