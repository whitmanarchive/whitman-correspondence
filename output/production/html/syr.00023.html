                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p"> It is a perfect shame I have not written you for so long, but I have been <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">wofully​ </span><span class="tei_corr">woefully&gt;​
        
      </span></span>
                lame and ill, and with a mind so weak and wandering that most of the time I have
                been actually unable to write. I now begin to feel a
                little better as the spring advances, though still greatly crippled. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I got your letter of last January (22d) and your card of Feb. 3rd from Elkton, telling <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00079.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00079.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00079.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> of your lecturing, at which proof of your activity I greatly
                rejoiced. I saw in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> today that you are to give
                your Lincoln lecture in Philadelphia.
            </p>   
            <p class="tei_p"> I wonder if Dr. Bucke got off. I had a letter from him some
                time ago telling me he expected to go, but have not since heard from him. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> C.W.E. and I were intensely amused at your "amiable clerk with a pen behind his
                ear," as applied to Stedman's book. The hit is palpable,
                like Hamlet's lunge. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am glad I sent you Nencioni's article. We are after
                it, hot foot, for I judge that <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00080.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00080.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00080.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> it must be fine. I made an effort to get it here, but could not
                find, however, where in Italy the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nuova Antologia</span> is
                published, though probably it is Florence or Milan. Kennedy
                promises to help find the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">locale</span>. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> It pleases me greatly to hear that your eyes are all right, or nearly so. Do take
                care of them, and beware of draughts—so grateful, but so pernicious. Dr.
                Bigelow, our greatest physician in Boston of old time,
                used to say that the back of the neck was more vulnerable than the heel of Achilles,
                when exposed to a draught, and he always put up his coat collar when he got into an
                omnibus or horse-car. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I heard yesterday that John Burroughs is coming down here. I
                shall be glad to see him, though I owe him a grudge for his late proposition to
                murder all the sparrows. This gives points to Herod, and is worse than the slaughter
                of the innocents, because they were Jew babies and had objectionable little hook
                noses. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The winter has been infernal here since January, and March is not much better. I
                hope the Spring, just beginning to open, may put new life into you. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Glad to hear of the English "offering," which I wish was much more. I wish we could get up a boom on your books. That McKay
                is a poor publisher. </p>

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00082.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00082.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00082.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p"> Wonders will never cease, and after all <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Houghton</span> consented
                to publish my little work "Hamlet's Note-Book," a copy of which I hope to send you
                in a few days. Everyone else refused it. The prejudice
                against the Baconians is amazing. The last publisher to whom I offered it (Coombes,
                of New York) although I proposed to pay the cost of manufacture, wrote in reply that
                he would undertake it, push it with energy, and do everything for it in his power,
                if I would only consent that his imprint should not appear on the title page!!! I
                never answered his letter. </p>
