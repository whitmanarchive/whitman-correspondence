                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

Herbert Gilchrist and William
                    Michael Rossetti had been collecting funds in England for the financial support
                    of Whitman. A paragraph in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span> of July
                    11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to
                    presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
                    in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
                    from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
                    himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
                    occasional contributions to magazines." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">12. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_syr.00023_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="syr.00023_n6"><span>O'Connor understood this
                    book as a "Baconian reply to R. G. White," a literary critic and scholar, who
                    argued that Shakespeare was not a pseudonym of Francis Bacon but indeed a
                    distinct historic figure and author. After numerous publishers had declined
                    O'Connor's manuscript, it was finally published in 1886 by Houghton, Mifflin and
                    Company (Boston and New York).
