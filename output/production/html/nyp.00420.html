                    McKinsey (1866–1950) was responsible for the invitation. McKinsey, then a
                    railroad clerk in Philadelphia, began to call on Whitman in 1884, as indicated
                    by his letter of <a href="loc.07022">June 10</a> and the reference to his
                    occasional visits in Whitman's Commonplace Book on June 17. In 1885 McKinsey

                    which he printed an interview with the poet on December 12. On March 12, 1886,
