            <p class="tei_p">The paper has just been forwarded here which tells me you are still suffering, 
                and not, as I was fondly believing, already quite emerged from the cloud of sickness. 
                My Darling—let me use that tender caressing word once more, for how can I help

                My darling. I say it over &amp; over to myself with voice with eyes so full of 
                love—of tender yearning sorrowful longing love. I would give all the world if 
                I might come (but am held here yet awhile inexorably by a duty nothing may supersede)

                You see dear Friend a woman who is a mother has thenceforth something of that feeling
