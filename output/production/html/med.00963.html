            <p class="tei_p">We were blessed with a most refreshing rain this morning,
                after a dry spell of three weeks, which had parched the ground to powder. New York
                is now in the height of the "dog-day" season. In every street, except those high up
                town, the very air one has to breathe is offensive, even without the loads of dust
                we have had of late. I am convinced that for some four or five weeks, the hot
                weather here is much more unbearable than any of yours at the South. Our evenings
                and mornings afford no relief during this time. The former are too disagreeable to
                sleep, and the latter send up odors to heaven whose offence is indeed rank. The heat
                is very stifling and oppressive, to people of feverish dispositions, causing a very
                fair idea of purgatory. Of course the only philosophy for the time is of that cool
                and easy sort which does not get disturbed by trifles. One had far better bear the
                ills he has than get excited and fly to others a thousand times worse. What's the
                state of the caloric in the Crescent City?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You can have no idea of the highly-strung interest felt by
                us New Yorkers in the progress of affairs in Ireland.
                It even divides public attention with the political matters of our own land. Surely,
                never before was there such a prospect of a collusion between power and right, as
                the last accounts from Ireland warranted. Here is the
                spirit-stirring appeal of the Directory for this
                city:</p>
            <p class="tei_p">[We published yesterday the appeal above alluded to. It is
                a nobly and eloquently worded document, short but comprehensive.—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eds. Crescent</span>.]</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see a little letter under date of July 24th, from Gen.
                    Taylor, in which the old hero says, "I am not a
                party candidate, and, if elected, shall not be the President of a party, but of the
                whole People." Good for Taylor! Such letters do him benefit here, far more than may
                be imagined.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Notwithstanding the heat, the places of public amusement
                keep open and are doing a good business. Hamblin is
                progressing rapidly with his improvements of the Park Theatre, both internally and
                externally. I have no doubt at all that he will make the establishment pay, and that
                it will prove one of the most popular places of dramatic entertainment in America.
                At the Bowery, now, they are balleting—Ciocca and
                Miss Turnbull being the principal performers. Niblo's
                (the Astor Opera House,) gives light comic pieces; Barton's ditto; and the National
                (Chatham) the usual variety.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have you had any meetings in New Orleans to raise
                contributions for Ireland? If not, will you allow me to suggest the holding of one
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">forthwith?</span></p>
