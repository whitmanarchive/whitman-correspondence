        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your note to–day. I send you a note I have written to Mr. Edmunds<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—first take it to Mr. Noyes,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> (to
        whom it is enveloped,) and get an additional line I have requested from him—&amp;
        then, if you conclude to try for the Carrier's place, go up &amp; take it yourself to Mr.
        Edmunds. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I must tell you another thing. I have written (wrote yesterday) a short note to Mr.
          Dubarry<a href="#n0203" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0203">3</a>, your Superintendent, asking him if you couldn't be better
        placed, when the changes of the Baltimore connection are made. It may not amount to any
        thing, but I took a notion to write it. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pete, I am not having a very good time—My head troubles me—yesterday was as bad
        as ever—as far from well as ever—to–day I am a little easier, &amp; have
        been out a few steps. But I keep up a good heart, dear son—&amp; you must too. </p>

        <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt.</span>
      </span>

      
        <p class="tei_p">If you conclude not to try for the Carrier's berth, let the letters go. </p>

Dubarry
                    (1830–1892) was named General Superintendent of the Northern Central
                    Railway of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company after the resignation of James C.
                    Clarke. In October 1882, Dubarry was named Second Vice President of the
                    Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Walt Whitman's letter to Dubarry is apparently
                    lost. </span></span> [<a href="#r0203">back</a>]</li></ul>
