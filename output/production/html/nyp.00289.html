                    had written of his "bad spells" in an earlier (lost) letter, for on <a href="duk.00637">February 4, 1869</a>, his mother wrote: "i was sorry,
                    Walter, you have them bad spells with your head. it must be very bad indeed,
                    there is a kind of linement called cloroform linement. it dont affect one in the least, that is to stupify, but it
                    is thought to be good for the neuralghy and rheumatism." An entry in an address book (Thomas Biggs Harned

                    indicate that he went in January to Dr. Charles H. Bowen, a Washington physician

                    <p class="tei_p">During the spring George was building houses in Brooklyn and, because of the
                        tight money situation, was having trouble arranging construction loans. Jeff
                        advanced $3,000, for which he was to receive a mortgage, and on <a href="duk.00576">March 15, 1869</a>, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman asked
                        Walt Whitman to lend George $600. Though no correspondence on the
                        subject between Walt Whitman and his family is extant, Jeff's letter of <a href="loc.00453">March 25, 1869</a> confirms the fact that Walt
                        Whitman assisted his brother, and on December 7, 1869, <a href="duk.00586">December 7, 1869</a> Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                        informed Walt Whitman that George was repaying $200.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">During 1869 the lot of the Whitmans underwent no changes. Heyde still wrote
                        nasty letters, and Hannah promised, when she got around to writing, a visit
                        to Brooklyn. Martha's health did not improve markedly. Though George
                        provided a new home for his mother, she complained that "these gals and
                        amusements takes the greenbacks" (Summer, The Trent Collection of
                        Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
                        Library). Mary Van Nostrand in October moved in "bag and baggage" with
                        Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Evidently Ansel Van Nostrand failed in business,
                        Louisa wrote on <a href="duk.00585">October 19, 1869</a>, "got a
                        drinking," and "come near dying with the deleru
                        tremen." Walt remained "the same good old standby." (Louisa Van Velsor
                        Whitman to Walt Whitman, <a href="duk.00582">June 30,
                    1869</a>.)</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
