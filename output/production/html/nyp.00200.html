            <p class="tei_p">I sit down home here in the front basement alone to write you a few lines. Mother is still at Burlington, &amp; I am waiting to hear from her, what she decides, about coming home—I shall probably go for her very shortly. I find it makes a mighty difference in my visit—(What is home without—&amp;c)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My dear little California is sick—infantile remittent fever—for the past week has just been lying quiet &amp; pale, eats literally nothing—it is pitiful, &amp; throws a gloom over every thing—doctor comes every day, &amp; sometimes twice a day—when I ask him about the chances, he is rather noncommittal—saying the disease in such a case as hers is expected to run fourteen days, before a turn for either better or worse—the fourteen days are up next Sunday—meanwhile she grows weaker &amp; weaker—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I am middling well—My brother George has resumed carpentering—he is well, &amp; looks fine—I see him every day—the rest of the folks all well. I send my love to Charles Eldridge—same to Ashton—when you write tell me the latest from the baby &amp; Mrs. Ashton. Send William the enclosed piece—it is one of those I spoke of—When you write direct to me, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Portland av. near Myrtle</span>.
