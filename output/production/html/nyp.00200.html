                    in Brooklyn early in October for "a month's furlough" (see Whitman's letter from
                        <a href="med.00313">October 15, 1865</a>
                    ), and evidently
                    returned to Washington on November 7 (see Whitman's letter from <a href="uva.00347">October 29, 1865</a>
                    ). He went to Brooklyn in
                    order to supervise the binding of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to Drum-Taps</span>,
                    which was printed in Washington; see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</span> (New York:

                    with William D. and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
                    to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>,
                    an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
                    O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
                    1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
                    Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
                    Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
                    correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
                    correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00200_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00200_n4"><span>Mrs. Whitman arrived in
                    Burlington, Vermont, on September 5, 1865. She wrote to Whitman on that date, as
                    well as on September 11, 21, and 27 (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
                    University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). She "found
                    hanna quite as well and better than i expected." Mrs. Whitman returned on
                    October 16 (see Whitman's letter of <a href="med.00313">October 15,
                        1865</a>
                    ). On <a href="loc.00440">July 16, 1865</a>, Thomas Jefferson Whitman had
                    described a long letter which Heyde had written to his mother: "He says he shall
                    leave Han, and go out west—I wish he was in Hell—Mother of course is
                    considerably exercised about it—and thinks she will go on there and bring
                    Han home." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00200_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00200_n5"><span>After toying with several
                    offers, including an appointment in the New York Custom House, George Washington
                    Whitman decided to return to housebuilding. "I am quite sure," Jeff wrote to
                    Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.00442">September 29, 1865</a>, "that if he
                    can keep devoted to his present undertaking he will make a handsome fortune in 8
                    or ten years—he certainly has the prospect of it." George had been
                    mustered out in July. Nothing came of his plans to remain a commissioned officer
                    in the regular army. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00200_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00200_n6"><span>Whitman enclosed a review

                    William D. O'Connor. O'Connor was so impressed that he planned to incorporate "a
                    great deal of it" into his manuscript, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span>
                    (13–14), which he was revising when he wrote on <a href="med.00327">October 19, 1865</a>: "But oh, Walt, the literary shortcomings of it
                    oppress me. It is not the thing that should be said of your book—not the
                    thing that it is in even me to say." At this time O'Connor had not found a
