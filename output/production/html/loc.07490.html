            <p class="tei_p">It is very pleasant &amp; sunny to-day &amp; I am going out in the rig abt 1 o'clock
                to my friends Mr &amp; Mrs Harned, three or four hours, &amp;
                have dinner &amp; a good generous drink of the best champagne—I enjoy
                everything—Nothing new with me—there seems to be some hitch in the 
                Herald's publ'ng my little pieces—(I hear that
                they have been appealed to in print to stop such stuff)—I feel lately as if I
                sh'd make a start in putting <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> in type making perhaps 150 to less than
                200 pp.—some 30 pp, perhaps, of poems to go afterward as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Annex</span> to L of G. My
                health though poor is "the same subject continued"—I enc: K[enne]dy's letter
                from Wilson—(not important)—Rhys is still in Boston—Morse in
                Indiana—I like Eakins' picture (it is like sharp cold cutting true sea
                brine)—I have not heard a word of the Worthington suit in N Y—not a word from my dear friend O'C[onnor] in
                Wash'n—</p>
