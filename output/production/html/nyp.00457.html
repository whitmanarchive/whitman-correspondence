            <p class="tei_p">Publishers secured—(not in the front rank at all, but young, experienced, &amp;
                I guess square &amp; the proposition to take the book comes vehemently from
                them)—Rees Welsh &amp; Co: 23 south 9th st: Phila: (dealers in 2d hand books
                &amp; pub: of law books &amp; some others)—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Satisfactory to
                    me, as I see at present, &amp; in prospect</span>. They are to publish L of G.
                same style as O[sgood]'s ed'n, same price, from my plates, &amp; pay me 35 cts a
                copy royalty—They are also to publish immediately my prose writings, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days, &amp; Collect</span>—a
                companion vol. to L of G. same price &amp; ab't same size, for which they pay me 22
                cts royalty. They consider favorably the idea of publishing Dr. Bucke's book
                also—&amp; I think will do so—though they have not pledged
                themselves—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By what I hear since I wrote last I think the enemy (in Boston)
                have formally appealed to the Post Master General to order L of G. excluded from the
                mails under the Comstock statutes—I think the P M
                G has it before him—perhaps has already decided—I keep well—</p>
