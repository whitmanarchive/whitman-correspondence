            <p class="tei_p">Sunday (day before yesterday) I went with Mrs Costelloe from London to 
                Hazelmere. I am confident they had not intended
                asking me but for some reason they did. Mrs C. was very nice indeed and I like her 
                as much as ever, neither do I believe
                that she has altered towards<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00448.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00448.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00448.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">really</span>, but for some reason
                she is silent on the subject—she did not speak of you 
                at all though we were much together
                and share of every thing else—I avoided the subject waiting to see if 
                she would begin upon it. Once she asked me what
                I was doing in the British Museum—I said "Working at some 
                translation" She wanted to know what
                translation. I told her something from the Danish for a book some of<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00449.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00449.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00449.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> us 
                were about to bring out.
                "Well what was the book about?" I said "about Walt Whitman" She said "oh" and did not pursue the subject. 
                I spent yesterday morning
                with Mr Smith—he did not speak of you except a very few words. I gave him your 
                message—he scarcely seemed to hear it.
                Still I believe he is friendly to you in his heart. Mrs S. is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> friendly she is the only one who said
                anything actually unfriendly—she did not say <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">much</span> but it was significant. I did not call on Tennyson
                as it was too late when I got to Hazelmere &amp; too early when I left the next day but I am to spend Saturday after noon and Sunday
                there and Mr Smith will take me to Tennyson's. I do not however expect to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">see</span> T.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All goes well, I am hearty and having a good time but shall be glad to get back and see my American &amp; Canadian friends again</p>
