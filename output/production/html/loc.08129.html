                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
                    Phyllis Theroux, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Book of Eulogies</span> [New York: Simon

                    Lotus Club speech about Shakespeare at the Broadway Theatre in New York on March
                    22, 1891, that was reported on in many newspapers. Whitman was quite taken with
                    the reports of the speech and told Horace Traubel that "Ingersoll's Sunday
                    speech . . . showed a change of base—a greater willingness to grant the
                    possibility of immortality" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman
                        in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). In that speech, Ingersoll said: "Suppose
                    that when you die, that is the end. The last thing that you will know is that
                    you are alive, and the last thing that will happen to you is the curtain, not
                    falling, but the curtain rising on another thought, so that as far as your
                    consciousness is concerned you will and must live forever. No man can remember
                    when he commenced, and no man can remember when he ends. As far as we are
                    concerned we live both eternities, the one past and the one to come, and it is a
                    delight to me to feel satisfied, and to feel in my own heart, that I can never
                    be certain that I have seen the faces I love for the last time. . . . And
                    whether there is another world, nobody knows. Nobody can affirm it; nobody can
                    deny it. . . . But if there is such a place, I hope that all good fellows will
                    be welcome" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Works of Robert G. Ingersoll</span> [New York:

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
