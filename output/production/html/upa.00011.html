                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been waiting quite a long while for time &amp; the right mood to answer your
                    letter in a spirit as serious as its own, &amp; in the
                same unmitigated trust &amp; affection. But more daily work than ever has fallen
                upon me to do the current season, &amp; though I am well &amp; contented, my best
                moods seem to shun me. I wished to give to it a day, a sort of Sabbath or holy day
                apart to itself, under serene &amp; propitious influencesâ€”confident that I
                could then write you a letter which would do you good, &amp; me too. But I must at
                least show, without further delay, that I am not insensible to your love. I too send
                you my love. And do you feel no disappointment because I now write but briefly. My
                book is my best letter, my response, my truest explanation of all. In it I have put
                my body &amp; spirit. You understand this better &amp; fuller &amp; clearer than any
                one else. And I too fully &amp; clearly understand the loving &amp; womanly letter
                it has evoked. Enough that there surely exists between us so beautiful &amp;
                delicate a relation, accepted by both of us with joy.
