            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been waiting quite a long while for time &amp; the right mood to answer your
                    letter<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in a spirit as serious as its own, &amp; in the
                same unmitigated trust &amp; affection. But more daily work than ever has fallen
                upon me to do the current season, &amp; though I am well &amp; contented, my best
                moods seem to shun me. I wished to give to it a day, a sort of Sabbath or holy day
                apart to itself, under serene &amp; propitious influences—confident that I
                could then write you a letter which would do you good, &amp; me too. But I must at
                least show, without further delay, that I am not insensible to your love. I too send
                you my love. And do you feel no disappointment because I now write but briefly. My
                book is my best letter, my response, my truest explanation of all. In it I have put
                my body &amp; spirit. You understand this better &amp; fuller &amp; clearer than any
                one else. And I too fully &amp; clearly understand the loving &amp; womanly letter
                it has evoked. Enough that there surely exists between us so beautiful &amp;
                delicate a relation, accepted by both of us with joy.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>

                    this letter aloud in 1889, Walt Whitman spoke at some length of the "passionate
                    love" of his friends which "offset the venomous hate" of his critics: "The
                    substance of that letter—its feel: what it starts out to say to her: oh!
                    with a few words taken out and put in—it would do for any of you!" (Horace
