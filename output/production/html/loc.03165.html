                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    physician Richard Maurice Bucke was traveling abroad in England in an attempt to
                    establish a foreign market for the gas and fluid meter he was developing with
                    his brother-in-law William Gurd. During this trip, on <a href="loc.08166">August 10, 1891</a>, Bucke sent Whitman a lengthy account of his meeting
                    with the British Poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. In an <a href="hyb.00018">August 20, 1891</a>, letter to Kennedy, Whitman had offered to send the
                    letter to Kennedy to read, after which Whitman directed that it should be
                    returned. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_loc.02861_n2 note" id="loc.02861_n2"><span>Alfred, Lord Tennyson
                    (1809–1892), among the best-known British poets of the latter half of the
                    nineteenth century, wrote such poems as "Morte d'Arthur," "Ulysses," "The Charge
                    of the Light Brigade," and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam A.H.H.</span>. In 1850,
                    the same year <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span> was published, Tennyson was
                    chosen as the new poet laureate of England, succeeding William Wordsworth. The
                    intense male friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which
                    Tennyson wrote after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly
                    influenced Walt Whitman's poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman
                    on <a href="med.00410">July 12, 1871</a>July 12, 1871. Although Tennyson
                    extended an invitation for Whitman to visit England in a <a href="med.00410">July 12, 1871</a>July 12, 1871, letter, Whitman never acted on the
                    offer. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
