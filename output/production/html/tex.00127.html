                    (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
                    August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
                    transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
                    February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
                    February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
                    and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
                    January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
                    Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's <a href="nyp.00193">September 11,
                    1864</a>. The
                    following September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was
                    appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until
                    his retirement in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was
                    prepared by Brown's family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_tex.00127_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="tex.00127_n2"><span>Thomas "Tom" P.

                    suffered heavy losses on July 2, 1863, in defense of the Emmitsburg Road at the

                    (1825&#x96;1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
                    in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
                        1880</span> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
                    Washington after the war; see "Letter from Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30,

                    [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 1:331&#x96;332). When a pension for
                    Whitman was proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was
                    quoted: "I am of opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during
                    the war accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr.
                    Whitman" (Thomas Donaldson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> [New
