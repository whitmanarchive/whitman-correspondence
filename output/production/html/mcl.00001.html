Trowbridge had said that
                        William H. Piper and Co., booksellers in Boston, were willing to take 50
                        copies of the new edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, and
                        that he could personally recommend the firm. For some time, Whitman did not
                        act on the suggestion that this firm could retail his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. However, in his <a href="duk.00656">September 24,
                            1870</a>, letter to Trowbridge, Whitman announced that he had "engaged
                        in electrotyping a new edition of my book." Then, Whitman asked for
                        the name of the Boston publisher who had been willing to sell his
                        book: "You sent me word a year or more ago of some Boston publisher, or
                        bookseller, who was willing (or perhaps wished) to sell my book—Who
                        was it?—I should like to have some such man there—to sell the
                        book on commission, &amp; be agent, depositor, &amp;c—."
                    The firm was advertised as Whitman's Boston agent in books published in 1871
                        and 1872. Later Whitman authorized Asa K. Butts and Co. to collect the money
                        Piper owed to him; see Whitman's <a href="yal.00399">December 29,
                            1873</a>, and <a href="loc.01195">February 4, 1874</a>, letters to
                        Butts.
