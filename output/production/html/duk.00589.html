                    24, 1870. The date 24 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the date March 24, 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller accepted
                    Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The letter was written just
                    after the death of Jesse Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son. Though Louisa
                    does not refer to Jesse by name, she identifies him as her "first born" and says
                    that he is to be buried in a "paupers grave." Jesse died in the Kings County
                    Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00589_n11 note" id="duk.00589_n11"><span>Jesse Whitman
                    (1818–1870) died at Kings County Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Walt
                    Whitman was notified of his brother's death (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22, 1870</a> letter), and Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was either notified at the same time or received notice from Walt. Jesse
                    had suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence for several
                    years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in December
                    1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew Jackson
                    Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in some
                    hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
                    Asylum on Flatbush Avenue. For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper,

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
