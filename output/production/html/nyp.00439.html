                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 5th rec'd &amp; welcomed. To keep you posted I
                make notes at random of this Osgood affair, &amp; send herewith. I have an article <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Memorandum at a
                    Venture</span> 5 or 6 pages signed by my name in the forthcoming June number <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">North American Review</span>, which, although hastily written &amp;
                eligible to great additions, I consider a sort of rallying point or key note to my
                position in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Children of Adam</span> business—will be out
                probably 12th to 15th of May—I shall have some proof copies, &amp; will send
                you two or three soon as I get them—(It is a paid for contribution, my own
                price given)—the newspapers specially like to have
                something <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">up at the moment</span>—this <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">N A
                    Rev.</span> piece might give a current reason-why for your
                article—commencing by alluding to it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The skeleton-facts of the Osgood publication are these. Osgood &amp; Co. wrote to me
                last May ('81) asking about a new &amp; complete edition &amp; suggesting that they
                were open to proposals. I wrote back that a new &amp; complete edition was
                contemplated but I wanted it distinctly understood that not a line was intended to
                be left out or expurgated—that the book must be printed in its entirety &amp;
                that those were prerequisites opening to any negotiation. They wrote back asking me to send the copy. I sent it. In a few days they wrote
                me that they would publish it. The bargain was closed. I was to have 12½ per cent on
                the sales, and the contract was to run ten years. I went on to Boston (Sept.
                    '81) and saw the book through the press—pub
                last of Nov. '81—(I think [some?] 3000 must have been published by them since
                    then.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In their penultimate letter (a month or so ago) Osgood &amp; Co: wrote me that the
                pieces the District Attorney specially &amp; absolutely required to be entirely
                expurgated were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">To a Common Prostitute</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Woman Waits for Me</span>—those left out the rest could be arranged
                without trouble, &amp; he would allow the publication to continue—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but the leaving out of those two pieces was
                indispensable</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall write you again, dear friend, as any thing occurs or suggests itself that I
                think you ought to know bearing on this matter—I am well as usual
                now—after a pretty bad month of illness—but mainly getting along pretty
                well &amp; in good spirits considering—</p>
