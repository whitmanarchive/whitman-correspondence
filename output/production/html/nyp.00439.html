                eligible to great additions, I consider a sort of rallying point or key note to my
                position in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Children of Adam</span> business—will be out
                probably 12th to 15th of May—I shall have some proof copies, &amp; will send
                you two or three soon as I get them—(It is a paid for contribution, my own
                price given)<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—the newspapers specially like to have
                something <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">up at the moment</span>—this <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">N A

            <p class="tei_p">The skeleton-facts of the Osgood publication are these. Osgood &amp; Co. wrote to me
                last May ('81) asking about a new &amp; complete edition &amp; suggesting that they
                were open to proposals. I wrote back that a new &amp; complete edition was
                contemplated but I wanted it distinctly understood that not a line was intended to
                be left out or expurgated—that the book must be printed in its entirety &amp;
                that those were prerequisites opening to any negotiation.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> They wrote back asking me to send the copy. I sent it. In a few days they wrote
                me that they would publish it. The bargain was closed. I was to have 12½ per cent on
                the sales, and the contract was to run ten years. I went on to Boston (Sept.
                    '81)<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> and saw the book through the press—pub
                last of Nov. '81—(I think [some?] 3000 must have been published by them since
                    then.)<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">In their penultimate letter (a month or so ago) Osgood &amp; Co: wrote me that the
                pieces the District Attorney specially &amp; absolutely required to be entirely
                expurgated were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">To a Common Prostitute</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Woman Waits for Me</span>—those left out the rest could be arranged
                without trouble, &amp; he would allow the publication to continue—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but the leaving out of those two pieces was
                indispensable</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall write you again, dear friend, as any thing occurs or suggests itself that I
                think you ought to know bearing on this matter—I am well as usual
                now—after a pretty bad month of illness—but mainly getting along pretty
                well &amp; in good spirits considering—</p>

                    overstated the number of copies printed by Osgood. In a letter to the poet on
                        <a href="loc.05595">January 25</a>, John H. Johnston quoted from a
                    note he had received from the publisher, who had "printed three editions, 2000
                    copies in all." The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Springfield Republican</span> on May 23
                    reported that 1600 copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> had been
                    sold "during the winter and spring" (see Whitman's letter to O'Connor of <a href="nyp.00440">May 25, 1882</a>). When Osgood discontinued publication
                    in April, the royalty due to Whitman amounted to $405.50 (see Whitman's
                    letter to Osgood &amp; Company of <a href="tex.00442">April 12, 1882</a>).
                    Unless there was a previous payment to the poet, Osgood sold 1622 copies of the
                    book ($405.50 @ .25 per copy). </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li></ul>
