                    1857–1928), a young English schoolteacher and friend of Herbert Gilchrist,
                    came to America in May, 1887. On <a href="loc.03928">March 31, 1887</a>
                    Gilchrist wrote to Whitman: "he is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet earnest
                    serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth, whose knowledge and
                    attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a clergyman, and
                    this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the sect of
                    his orthodox family." An entry in Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 29 reads:
