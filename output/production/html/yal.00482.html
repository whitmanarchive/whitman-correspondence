            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">have just heard by Horace Traubel that (thro' you) Col.
                    Ingersoll favors the idea of a public meeting &amp; address
                ab't me—(get the notion that he has been <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">solicited</span> or
                even <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">persuaded</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">wh' I don't like at
                    all</span>—not warranted or authorized by me, at any rate—but let that
                    pass)—If this is so ab't Col. I's design I
                myself think the best place would be New York City, tho' I believe Horace &amp; some
                other friends believe Phila: best—Of course I dont know what Col I's drift
                and vein may be, but I know it w'd be grand, &amp; something I sh'd be proud
                of—On the impulse of the moment I have gather'd these items enclosed &amp;
                send to you, to give all the note (with scraps enclosed all as it is) to Col. I with
                my respects, thanks, &amp; love—I shall give the
                whole proposed meeting, address &amp;c: into his and y'r &amp; the friends'
                hands—without any meddling by me—</p>
