                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    lecture in his honor, which would take place on October 21 at Philadelphia's
                    Horticultural Hall. Johnston and the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke
                    planned the event, and Robert Ingersoll delivered the lecture. See Ingersoll's

                    he received the items that Whitman refers to here, suggesting that the October 3

                    "Well the Ingersoll lecture came off last evn'g in Horticultural Hall, Broad st:
                    Phila:—a noble, (very eulogistic to WW &amp; L of G) eloquent speech, well
                    responded to by the audience. There were 1600 to 2000 people, (choice persons,)
                    one third women (Proceeds to me $869.45)—I went over, was wheeled on
                    the stage in my ratan chair, and at the last spoke a very few words—A
                    splendid success for Ingersoll, (&amp; me too.) Ing. had it written, &amp; read
