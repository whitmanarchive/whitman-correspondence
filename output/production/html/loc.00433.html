I had in it a ham piece of smoked beef can of milk (condensed) coffee can of peaches—crackers—potatoes—salt—and the clothes that he sent for—I think I will send him another next week or week after—We were all elated upon seeing the letters published yesterday about the exchange of prisoners.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> O I so hope they will make an exchange—can you not write something that will keep up the talk about the matter, sometimes little weights when the[y] fall at the right moment turn the scale and accomplish great results  Seems as if twould be worth almost a life time to help along such a thing as the general exchange of prisoners—</p>

It is suggestive of scalps, war and paint—whiskey and laziness  However I suppose you have not yet had time to tell what the business is about but anyhow if it is only a comfortable berth without too much hard work, it will come in good<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—I hope you will have good health—I would suggest that you should not go it too strong in the Hospital way, for a while—I would draw it mild for a month or so—How does it seem to you to go back—I suppose it looks quite natural—I hope to be able to come and make you a visit soon—probabaly some time next mont[h]—Write to me Walt—I like to hear from you often—Write to George tell him we sent his box and will send more</p>

                    spells, Walt left Washington on June 22, 1864, for an extended period of
                    recuperation at home. While the poet was in Brooklyn, his brother George was
                    captured on September 30, 1864, at Poplar Grove, Virginia, sent to prisons in
                    Salisbury, North Carolina, and Richmond, and eventually placed in a Confederate
                    military prison at Danville, Virginia, about October 22 (Jerome M. Loving, ed.,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</span>
                    [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975], 18). The four letters
                    written after Walt's return to Washington on January 23, 1865, reveal how Jeff
                    and Walt coordinated their efforts in sending food and clothing to George and
                    attempting to secure his release.<p class="tei_p">This was a period of great fear, anxiety,
                        and frustration for the Whitman family. Daily they read lurid newspaper
                        accounts of the barbarous conditions in Confederate prisons and hospitals,
                        including several articles by an escaped prisoner of war, Albert D.
                        Richardson. In public testimony before a congressional committee, Richardson
                        charged "that the rebel authorities are murdering our soldiers at Salisbury
                        by cold and hunger, while they might easily supply them with ample food and
                        fuel" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Union</span>, January 31, 1865). He
                        accused the Confederates of deliberate and systematic atrocities and
                        estimated that prisoners "were dying at the average rate of twenty-eight per
                        day, or thirteen per cent per month" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening Post</span>,
                        January 31, 1865). Such harrowing stories must have moved the Whitmans to
                        despair of recovering George.</p><p class="tei_p">At the same time, the likelihood of a
                        general prisoner exchange seemed ever more remote. Exchanges had seldom
                        worked well in this war and had long been a subject of controversy among
                        Union leaders. Grant had ordered all exchanges halted until the Confederates
                        improved their treatment of black prisoners and released enough Union men to
                        offset those Confederates who had been exchanged but had illegally returned
                        to arms. Richardson's articles and former Brigadier General Benjamin
                        Franklin Butler's speech of January 28, 1865, confirmed Jeff's fears that
                        Grant did not want to exchange "good men for poor ones," and he somewhat
                        pathetically asked Walt how Grant could be "willing to let the men starve
                        and die without result" (see Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00434">January 31, 1865</a>). But Richardson claimed that
                        such was the "cold-blooded" policy of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and
                        that it had already cost the lives of ten thousand Union solders; and
                        Butler, who had long advocated a more liberal exchange program, exculpated
                        himself and placed responsibility squarely upon Grant.</p><p class="tei_p">While modern
                        historians have rejected the notion that conditions in Confederate prison
                        camps resulted from a willful and systematic policy, they have confirmed
                        that Grant did halt prisoner exchanges in order to deprive the South of
                        needed reinforcements. Only in late January 1865, when he realized the war
                        was coming to an end, did Grant agree to a policy of even exchange. The
                        uncertainties and tensions of these two weeks intensified Jeff's fears for
                        George's health and safety and gave added cause for his skepticism of public
                        officials.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00433_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00433_n2"><span>Whitman's letter of

                    should soon follow. Grant added that supplies were being distributed to
