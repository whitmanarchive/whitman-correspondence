                    8, 1865. The date "August 8" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1865 to the letter, and Edwin Haviland Miller
                    agreed with Bucke's date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence,

                    1:376). The year can be confirmed based on Louisa's many references to her son
                    George Washington Whitman: her admiration for his uniform in preparation for a
                    military review, his need to "settle up" his pay at the conclusion of his
                    service, and his possible plans to seek "journey work" (day labor). It is
                    consistent also with Thomas Jefferson Whitman's recommendation that George start
                    up his own business. </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00438_n1 note" id="duk.00438_n1"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years
                    Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until
                    the end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
                    (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
                    (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Smith and later a mason named French. George
                    also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. George
                    struggled initially to find employment after the war. He ate meals with Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman and his brother Edward at the Portland Avenue house in
                    Brooklyn but boarded in a rented room. For more information on George Washington

                    letter, Jeff was employed as a civil engineer at the Brooklyn Water Works, and
                    in 1867 he moved to St. Louis to become Superintendent of Water Works, where he
                    become a nationally recognized name. Jeff encouraged his brother George
