            in camp i hope George will get in
            something he is very restless i tell him
            to not be worried i dont think it is because
            he is uneasy about gitting A living but such
            a change he is much stouter than when
            he was home before
            i wish he could get

            a shop lease or buy a lot and go in business

            of the kind there is one or two wants to
            go in with him) but i think it is such
            an exciting life to live if any bad luck
            should befall him) i tell him to not be
            in a hurry but rest but i can see he is very
            uneasy he got a very honerable discharge
                the turnout to honor the regment i gess was
                very good Jeff and matty and hattie went over
            to see it they went over some store of Jeffs friends and
            had a good view
            george went over early in 
            in the morning and it came nearly 3 oclock
            and no george come i couldent think what
            was the matter pretty soon he come on the horse
            he was to ride he had no time to eat any dinner
            he wore his new sword and sash looked very
            good) i dont know when i shall go to Burlington
                the weathe has been so hot and i have felt
                so weak but i shall go i think quite soon
            george has gone to new york to see about
            getting some clothing the military must be
            all doffed
            i think he ought to be rejoised
            to think he went through the war without the
            loss of a limb there is so many unfortunates
            poor fellows)
            Jeff and mat and the children
            had a very pressing invitation to come to masons
            fathers he is home on a 30 days furlough 
            but
            Jeffy cant leave mr Lane is away in the
                country
                write walt what you think about
            georges going into the building line jeff
            is going to put up a small house i think
            he is to have money of Dr. Ruggles
                write
            just what you think would be best for
            George Walt write it just to me and not
            for the family i expect han thinks we are
