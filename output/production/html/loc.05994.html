                    the last two days. As I write, the sun is out, &amp; my bird singing—I
                    have had my dinner, mutton-stew, onions, &amp; greens—(I used the vinegar
                    you gave me on 'em—good—the bottle is most all gone, &amp; I shall
                    bring it down to be fill'd up)—I have not felt as well as usual the last
                    three days— we had it hot &amp; disagreeable enough here
                    previous—Susan come up here &amp; stay awhile &amp; visit
                    us—George too—Mrs. D would be glad too—Lord be easy with you

                    stay here in the Germanic 4 or 5 days, not more, and then shall come on to
                    Camden, where I want to lodge, if I can find a lodging. —simply, one
                    decent clean bedroom will do for me. </p>
