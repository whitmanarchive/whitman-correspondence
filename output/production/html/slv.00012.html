                    (1866–1953) was an Australian poet, lawyer, activist, and journalist. He
                    and his wife, Evangeline Mina Fryer, began a weekly discussion club with secular
                    and Whitmanesque inclinations called the Australeum. His letter of March 12,
                    1890, began a correspondence with Whitman that lasted until November 1, 1891,
                    and assumed the character of a religious experience, always saluting Whitman
                    with reverential appellations. For more, see Alan L. McLeod, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_367.html">Whitman in Australia and New Zealand</a>," J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

                    referencing the first National Australasian Convention, which was held in Sydney
                    in March and April 1891. The Convention officially marked the start of the
                    journey for six British colonies—New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland,
                    South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania—towards nationhood. In a
                    process that took several years, the colonies agreed upon a Constitution Bill,
                    and the British Parliament passed The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act
                    in 1900. Queen Victoria gave her royal assent to the legislation, which took
                    effect on January 1, 1901. At the start of 1901, Australia's six colonies became
                    a nominally independent nation, able to collectively govern as the unified
                    Commonwealth of Australia.  </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_slv.00012_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="slv.00012_n2"><span>Whitman has written the
