            <p class="tei_p">You may think yourself neglected—perhaps forgotten—by your American
                friend. But not forgotten, believe me. Twenty times during the last year have I
                promised myself to write you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am still here at Washington—every thing much the same in my condition as when
                you made your brief visit here.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I continue well in health &amp; good spirits—&amp; as usual spend much more of
                my leisure in the open air, than reading, studying, or in-doors at all.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am very soon going on to New York to bring out a new edition of my poems—same
                as the copy you have, only in one Vol.—shall remain there until about 7<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span> of April—(my address there will be, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">107 north Portland av. Brooklyn, New York, U.S.
                America</span>)—Then to return again here (where my address will be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Solicitor's Office Treasury, Washington, D.C.</span> &amp;c.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your two letters from England duly reached me at the times, &amp; were very welcome.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Tennyson has twice written to me—&amp; good friendly letters. He invites me to visit him.</p>

                    barrister and a friend of Tennyson; see Harold Blodgett, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman in England</span> (1934), 128–129. According to the February 20,
                    1886 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Solicitor's Journal</span>, Flower was appointed a Lord of
                    the Treasury (275). Flower served as a member of Parliament from 1880 to 1892, when he
                    was given the title Baron Battersea (see the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gazette</span> (6 September 1892), 5090). According to Flower's <a href="loc.01616">April 23, 1871</a> letter, he met Whitman in Washington
                    in December, 1870. He had later delivered some of Whitman's books to Tennyson,
                    who "was much touched by your memory of him, and I told him of your deep regard
                    for him." On <a href="loc.01617">July 16, 1871</a>, Flower informed
                    Whitman that Tennyson was sending a letter by the same mail (Tennyson's letter
                    was dated <a href="med.00410">July 12, 1871</a>). Flower wrote again on
                        <a href="loc.01618">October 20, 1871</a>: "When I read you or think of
                    you . . . I feel that I hold in my hand clasped strong &amp; tight &amp; for
                    security the great hand of a friend, a simple good fellow, a man who loves me
                    &amp; who is beautiful because he loves, &amp; with the Consciousness of that I
                    feel never alone—never sad." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n4">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01694_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01694_n4"><span>A draft of this letter is in
