            <p class="tei_p">Down here again spending a few days—nothing very different—pretty much
                the same story of all my letters—but I knew you would like to hear—Mrs
                S[tafford] and all the family well as usual—they often speak of you &amp; of
                the old times—I was over to the creek and by the old walnut-trees last
                week—all beautiful &amp; refreshing as ever—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Harry is still at Clementon—Mont is with B. S. at Kirkwood station—Ed has
                gone up to Phila: to-day for store goods—Do you know of David Bogue, bookseller, Trafalgar Sq: who publishes my book in
                London? Have you ever been in his place? I go up to Camden this evening—Yours
                of last Jan: &amp; your mother's of Feb. 6 rec'd—</p>
