                    (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
                    sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,
                    1893, and then he returned to the United States to commence his practice in
                    Alexandria, Indiana. For more information, see Bert A. Thompson, "Edward

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
