               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel middling well to-day. I go to the office just the same as usual—If I had a good home where I could have a decent time, &amp; keep in for three or four days, I should get all right—the principal trouble with me, I think, is neuralgia—it gives me great distress in the head at times—but the spells do not last long at a time—I eat pretty nearly the same as usual—but do not sleep well—But I think I am making too much of it—I thought I would write you just a few lines, you would get Saturday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You must tell Jeff or George to get the "Galaxy" of Dec. 1.—it is a magazine—it is for sale at most of the book-stands—30 cts—it has a piece in about me<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I think it is very good—John Burroughs is a young man from Delaware county, New York—he lives here, now, is married—I am well acquainted with him, &amp; he &amp; his wife have been very hospitable &amp; friendly to me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Conway's article<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> was about as impudent as it was friendly—quite a mixture of good &amp; bad.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad you like Emily Price—she is a good girl. She seems to me one that you needn't make any fuss or change—but let domestic things go on just as they may be, when she comes to visit you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is pleasant this afternoon—the sun is shining out—the river &amp; hills on the other side look beautiful.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent Han a book—"Lady Audley's Secret"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—&amp; shall send her a letter to-day.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dont forget, George or Jeffy, to get the Galaxy of Dec. 1.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, if any of you want another copy of the new "Leaves of Grass," I can send you an order for one on the binder in New York, &amp; you can get it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I believe that is all—except that I am getting a new pair of trowserloons—Shall not get any other new clothes this winter—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Love to George &amp; all.</p>

                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Galaxy</span> was edited by W. C. and F. P. Church; see
                    "Letter from Walt Whitman to W. C. Church, 7 August 1867" (Edwin Haviland
                    Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York, North
                    Carolina: New York University Press, 1961–77] 1:335–336). When W. C.
                    Church wrote on June 13 to William O'Connor (Charles E. Feinberg Collection),
                    requesting an article, he suggested that the magazine publish Burroughs's "Walt
                    Whitman and His 'Drum-Taps,'" which appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Galaxy</span>, 2 (<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00061.html">December 1, 1866</a>), 606–615. In a letter to Moncure Conway on
                    December 5, O'Connor asserted fervidly that Burroughs's was "the first article .
                    . . that reveals real critical power and insight, and a proper reverence, upon
                    the subject of Whitman's poetry" (Yale). Whitman's biographer, Gay Wilson Allen,
                    concurs in O'Connor's judgment: Burroughs "deserves credit for having lifted the
                    criticism of Whitman's poems to the plane of reason and intellectual
                    appreciation" (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer: A
