            <p class="tei_p">I will write you just a line, to show you I am here away north, &amp; alive &amp; kicking. 
                I delivered my poem here before the College yesterday. All went off very well.—(It is rather provoking—after feeling unusually well this whole summer,—since 
                Sunday last I have been about half sick &amp; am so yet, by spells.) I am to go 
                to Vermont, for a couple of days, &amp; then back to Brooklyn—Pete I received your letter, that you had been taken off—write to <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01598.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01598.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01598.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01598.002.jpg</span>me Saturday 30th or Sunday—direct to usual address 107 Portland av. Brooklyn. I will send you the little book with my poem, 
                (&amp; others) when I get back to Brooklyn. Pete did my poem appear in the Washington papers—I suppose Thurs-day or Friday—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Chronicle</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Patriot</span>?<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—If so, send me one—(or one of each)</p>
           
            
            <p class="tei_p">—It is a curious scene here, as I write, a beautiful old New England village, 150 years old, 
                large houses &amp; gardens, great elms, plenty of hills—every thing comfortable, but very Yankee—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not an African to be seen all day</span>—not a grain of dust—not a car to be seen or heard—green 
                grass every where—no smell of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">coal tar</span>—As I write a party are playing base ball on a large green 
                in front of the house—the weather suits me first rate—cloudy but no rain.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
