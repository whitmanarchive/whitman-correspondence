                <span class="tei_salute">Dear son,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I will write you just a line, to show you I am here away north, &amp; alive &amp; kicking. 
                I delivered my poem here before the College yesterday. All went off very well.—(It is rather provoking—after feeling unusually well this whole summer,—since 
                Sunday last I have been about half sick &amp; am so yet, by spells.) I am to go 
                to Vermont, for a couple of days, &amp; then back to Brooklyn—Pete I received your letter, that you had been taken off—write to <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01598.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01598.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01598.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>me Saturday 30th or Sunday—direct to usual address 107 Portland av. Brooklyn. I will send you the little book with my poem, 
                (&amp; others) when I get back to Brooklyn. Pete did my poem appear in the Washington papers—I suppose Thurs-day or Friday—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Chronicle</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Patriot</span>?—If so, send me one—(or one of each)</p>
           
            
            <p class="tei_p">—It is a curious scene here, as I write, a beautiful old New England village, 150 years old, 
                large houses &amp; gardens, great elms, plenty of hills—every thing comfortable, but very Yankee—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not an African to be seen all day</span>—not a grain of dust—not a car to be seen or heard—green 
                grass every where—no smell of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">coal tar</span>—As I write a party are playing base ball on a large green 
                in front of the house—the weather suits me first rate—cloudy but no rain.
