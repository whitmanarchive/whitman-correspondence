                    (1815–1900) was a suffragist and abolitionist who later founded the

                    the couple's home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Leggett, who was also
                    the grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
                    from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in

                    Elisa Leggett, was an aspiring artist who made several pencil sketches of
                    Whitman on December 21, 1881. They resulted in the oil painting now in the
                    Feinberg Collection (Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On <a href="med.00716">August 11, 1885</a>, Whitman wrote to Percy in answer

                    and his friend Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke traveled throughout Canada after
                    spending a month relaxing at the Asylum for the Insane in London, Ontario, where
                    Bucke was the superintendent. They visited Toronto, Lake of the Thousand
                    Islands, and the St. Lawrence River, among other places. On the return journey,
                    Bucke traveled with Whitman as far as Niagara, at which point the poet returned
                    to New Jersey on his own. </span></span> [<a href="#r1004">back</a>]</li></ul>
