            <p class="tei_p">The old proverb, (or is it an old one?) that
                "corporation have no souls," does not seem applicable to the corporation of this
                city, in one respect at least. Hardly a visiter or any note comes among us, without
                being invited by the Common Council to partake of the public hospitalities, visit
                the charitable institutions of New York, and eat and drink some suppers or dinners,
                as the case may be. Well, for my part, I think the practice a very commendable one;
                it creates a general good feeling between the city authorities—the essence of the
                whole body of citizens—and the visiters or sojourners among us. Besides, it has a
                good effect on the public institutions, which, daily susceptible of inspection from
                travelled critics, acquire an ambition and care they might not otherwise have. Yes,
                I think the custom more honored in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">observance</span> than in the breach;
                notwithstanding the scruples of penny-wise economists, who see nothing but the
                shillings immediately before their eyes. Last night, the hospitalities of the city
                were tendered to Commodore M. E. Perry, of the frigate Cumberland.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">At the same time,
                the city fathers confirmed the Mayor's re-appointment of Mr. Matsell as Chief of the
                Municipal Police. By the way, it may not be amiss to mention, that this new Criminal
                Prevention and Crime Discovering System has worked charmingly for the last three or
                four years, since its first adoption. Some will always be found—at least some always
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have</span> been found—to carp and cavil at it; but the sober judgment of the community is,
                I think, convinced in its favor—not but that there are items of wrong now and then;
                it will be impossible to organize a system which has them not; but, upon the whole,
                it works better, and seems founded on a better principle, than any other police
                regulations in any city of this country.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Among the cases, yesterday, that came
                before the police court, was one of a somewhat peculiar character—the only one of
                its kind that has yet come to light, and it is much to be hoped that no other of the
                kind has happened at all. Ex-Lieutenant J. W. Green, formerly of the New York
                Volunteers, was arrested for surreptitiously retaining a gold watch, belonging to
                Capt. C. H. Pearson, whose obsequies have so recently been celebrated in this city
                and Brooklyn. Capt. P. died last October, in Mexico, from a wound received at
                Chapultepec, and, in his last illness, was attended by Green, to which latter
                personage, the dying Captain bequeathed his effects in charge to take home to his
                relatives in Brooklyn. But the Ex-Lieutenant, instead of making them over, on his
                arrival here, presented (that's the story, at least,) a bill of $50 for
                expenses, which Captain Pearson's brother here paid. A man named Dunn, however,
                happened to be in Captain P's. employ, and he was aware of Green's commission to
                bring home the watch, a ring, etc. He also comes to New York, and accidentally
                informed Robert H. Pearson of the facts. So upon Master Green's appearance again he
                was arrested, and is in custody. Such are the statements on the police books. It is
                as well, however, to wait for the other side of the story, before giving the harsh
                judgment which Green will deservedly receive from the public at large, if these
                statements are true. One is led to hope, for the honor of human nature, and
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">soldier's</span> nature, that there are some extenuating circumstances on Green's side, or
                that the story is an error.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The health of New York is unusually good, considering
                the time of year. Deaths last weeks, 277—with the usual horrible fact that more than
                half that number were under two years of age. We are glad to learn that New Orleans
                bids fair, thus far, for a comparatively healthy summer.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">A portion of our
                fashionables—though not so large a number as usual—are off, these days, to Saratoga,
                Newport, Rockaway, and all the long list of "genteel" resorts, Poor <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">devil's​ </span><span class="tei_corr">devils​
        
      </span></span>!
                Most of them leave home, and comparative comfort not for the unbuckled,
                free-and-easy enjoyment of a few weeks in the country, with free rambling, bathing,
                and the privilege of eating dinner in one's shirt-sleeves, should one so choose; but
                to conform still more tightly to ceremonials and observances, and to neither get the
                good nor the health of a really enjoyed country jaunt. What nonsense! However, each
                one to his taste; and if <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that</span> be their's, why even let them stick to it, in the
                devil's name.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Day after to-morrow, (27th inst.) the New York Volunteers—the remains
                of the Regiment having now all arrived—will be complimentarily received by the
                magnates of the city, with beating of drums, flying of flags, firing of cannon, and
                plenty to eat and drink. Every body is pleased at this arrangement. People will be
                still better pleased when the Common Council appropriates a few thousand dollars to
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">actual comforts</span>, such as clothing, &amp;c. of the Volunteers. It is understood that
                the objection to appropriate this money is not on account of the money itself, but
                from a feeling of delicacy toward the General Government, against whom it will look
                like levelling a bit of practical irony.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">On the evening next Thursday, there is also
                to be, in the Park, a grand re-union of the ultras among Whigs and Democrats, who,
                thereunto called by their oldest chieftains and bugle-blowers, meet to entrench
                themselves on the "platform" of "Free Soil." A great gathering will doubtless
                convene together—and, if John Van Buren holds forth, I promise you a good personal
                description of that rising star.</p>
