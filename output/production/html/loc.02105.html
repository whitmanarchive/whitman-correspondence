                    Harry Buxton Forman, was most notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley
                    and John Keats. On <a href="loc.01619">February 21, 1872</a>, Buxton sent

                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
