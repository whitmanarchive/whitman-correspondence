            <p class="tei_p">Four letters of the 18th and 19th of October reached me
                together as you intended. You may be sure, dear Walt Whitman, that the moment I had
                them I wrote to Mr. Balestier to make an appointment. He
                replied promptly that what he was really after was the American copyright—only

                said he would appoint a meeting very shortly; &amp; I am daily expecting to hear
                again. My own impression is that if you revised your works finally in few or many
                details, and the revision was first published here, the new readings would have
                English copyright—which a publisher could defend, and so maintain the position

Anything that I can do to forward your
                views will be a pleasure to me, be sure; but I expect to get no further with Mr.
                Balestier than to ascertain just what is the scope and end of his present approach
                to you. The moment I can see what he is driving at I will write to you again. About

                enclosure which is too precious to name. Could I have caught the Cunarder-mail
                of this morning from Queenstown, I should have written
                yesterday, if only to send my love and thanks for the delicate kindness you have
                done me. Your intuitive knowledge of men is wonderful: I do not know anything you
                could have sent that would have touched me as your latest gift has done. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">But how did you know that, dear Walt Whitman</span>?</p>
