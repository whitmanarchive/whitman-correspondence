            <p class="tei_p">I write to say that Mattie is very sick—that although yet hopeful—I fear very much that in some of the paroxisms of coughing she may become so weak that she will not rally again—most of the time she continues cheerful and good—but at times her sufferings are too much for her to bear—as good as she always has been about such things</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Of course we will all hope and pray for the best—yet you must not be surprised to hear that it is all over with the dear soul at any time—I have written to Walt—I wish Walt would come and see her—do you not think he would—Love to all</p>
