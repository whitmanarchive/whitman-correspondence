                <span class="tei_salute">My Dear Mr. Whitman:—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Since Jeff's death I have been
                constantly thinking that there should be some proper obituary notice of him
                published in one of the engineering journals.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At the time of the death of Moses Lane, I found that the notices which I wrote brought forth
                others from his friends, and withal it was very satisfactory to his family and those
                to whom he was especially dear.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">In Jeff's case, there is no one of us that knows enough
                of his early life to write a proper notice, in fact, there is no one that can do
                this with justice to his memory among us, save possibly Worthen, or Joe Davis, and we cannot hope
                for anything from them. Therefore, the thought has occurred to me that if you would
                write a notice that would take up say not over half a column Publisher says you may take a whole column, (as it is very difficult, you know, in one of these
                engineering journals, to get more than this), if you would do this, I would attend
                to having it published in one of the engineering journals, and I know that it would
                be a very great satisfaction to his friends in the profession.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The death of Jeff has been a very great blow to me
                personally, as for a good many years I looked upon him as one of my warmest friends.
                Our association of the last four or five years has been constant, and very close,
                and I have learned to lean upon<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00444.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00444.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00444.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00445.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00445.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00445.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> him
                in so many ways that I feel as though a prop were taken out of my life by his
                death.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sorry to have to write you a machine letter now,
                but my crippled arm makes this a necessity.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you agree with me, and are willing and strong enough to furnish me
                the manuscript, I would suggest your doing it at once, as I shall be away from home
                after a few days, and besides that, it should be published as soon as possible.</p>
