                <span class="tei_salute">My Dear Mr. Whitman:—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Since Jeff's<a href="#n0710" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0710">2</a> death I have been
                constantly thinking that there should be some proper obituary notice of him
                published in one of the engineering journals.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">At the time of the death of Moses Lane,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">3</a> I found that the notices which I wrote brought forth
                others from his friends, and withal it was very satisfactory to his family and those
                to whom he was especially dear.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">In Jeff's case, there is no one of us that knows enough
                of his early life to write a proper notice, in fact, there is no one that can do
                this with justice to his memory among us, save possibly Worthen,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> or Joe Davis,<a href="#n0185" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0185">5</a> and we cannot hope
                for anything from them. Therefore, the thought has occurred to me that if you would
                write a notice that would take up say not over half a column Publisher says you may take a whole column, (as it is very difficult, you know, in one of these
                engineering journals, to get more than this), if you would do this, I would attend
                to having it published in one of the engineering journals, and I know that it would
                be a very great satisfaction to his friends in the profession.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">The death of Jeff has been a very great blow to me
                personally, as for a good many years I looked upon him as one of my warmest friends.
                Our association of the last four or five years has been constant, and very close,
                and I have learned to lean upon<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00444.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00444.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00444.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00444.jpg</span><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00445.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00445.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00445.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00445.jpg</span> him

                    Horace Tarr and Horace G. Tarr) (ca. 1844–1922), a native of Missouri, was
                    the nephew of the Brooklyn engineer Moses Lane (1823–1882). Tarr served in
                    the Civil War, enlisting with Company K 20th Regiment of the Connecticut
                    Infantry Volunteers in 1862, when he was still a teenager. After Gettysburg,
                    Tarr was promoted to first Lieutenant, and, during the Atlanta campaign, he
                    became the Captain of Company F. After the Civil War, Tarr worked as an engineer
                    and a business manager for two iron companies. He later married, and he and his
                    wife were the parents of six children. Tarr was mentioned in the correspondence
                    between Whitman and his brother, Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890) and

                    "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
                    eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
                    recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
                    marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
                    his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!"
