            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">All quiet in front of Petersburg, and everything going on just the same as when I last wrote. We came out from the front line, last night and are now at our camp, in the woods about half a mile from the enemy's works. We go up  in front and stay 48 hours and then come back here and stay the next 48.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I received Walts letter of July 14th and am looking every day to hear from you again.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother I hope you are all well at home,  Walt I hope is all right before now.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I have never been heartier than I have been this summer,  we live very well here and are a great deal more comfortable than one would think. I wrote you last, about the 13th of this month,  did you get the letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are kept pretty buissy, while we are back in Camp, makeing out papers for men who are sent away sick or wounded, but still we dont kill ourselvs with hard work. Well Mother it is getting late and I am getting sleeppy, so good night,  I will write again soon. Much love to all.</p>
