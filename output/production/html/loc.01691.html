            <p class="tei_p">Would the accompanying piece, "Passage to India," be available to you, to be printed as leading article 
                in either the June or July number of the "Overland"? The price is $200, and I should like 20 copies of the numberâ€”I reserve the right to print it in future book. My address is at this office.
