                    was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp most likely met in
                    Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan. Clapp, who founded the
                    literary weekly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span> in 1858, was
                    instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over twenty items on
                    Whitman appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> before the periodical
                    folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace Traubel, "You
                    will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know all about me."
                    For more about Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
