                    (1849–1934) was among Edward Carpenter's circle of Whitman admirers in
                    England. On November 13, Carpenter sent Whitman—in a letter now
                    lost—Vines's request for books. On the same date he sent this letter to
                    Vines, Whitman sent a letter to Carpenter, noting, "have to-day mailed Mr Vines'
                    books" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman: The
                        Correspondence</span>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77), 3:103). At that time, Vines was Fellow and
                    Lecturer in Botany at Christ's College, Cambridge, and later was named
                    Sherardian Professor of Botany at Oxford. Whitman received word from Carpenter
                    on December 19 that "I hear from Vines that your books have arrived" (Horace

                    inscribed by Whitman, "Sidney H. Vines from the author," was among the books
