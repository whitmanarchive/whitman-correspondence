                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Also, see the letter from Whitman to
                    Herbert Gilchrist of <a href="loc.02162">July 22, 1877</a>. In a news
                    article in the Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Post</span> on August 2, which
                    quoted from the Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span>, Whitman, who was
                    obviously the anonymous author, referred to Herbert's portrait of himself: "The
                    painting, which is now well advanced, and promises to be an excellent likeness,
                    represents Mr. Whitman sitting in an easy chair under a favorite tree." Whitman
                    expected to return to Camden on Friday, July 6, as noted in his letter to John
                    Burroughs of <a href="prc.00047">June 22, 1877</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
