            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed $10 is from Mr James P. Kirkwood<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> for the use of the Hospital soilders  I will mail you another letter with some more money to-morrow</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How goes things with you, Walt? What about coming home? I have not written you very lately, I have been so very busy. Mother and the rest are about the same. Andrew does not get better. I fear than Andrew will never get better. He looks very bad rather a painful case. I yesterday wrote you a letter and enclosed some money from myself, after thinking the matter over I destroyed the letter and shall give the money to Andrew, did I not do right</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In acknowledging the receipt of money from me please state the amount but not who from as I dont want them to know that I dont send any myself but I honestly think when I possibly can give any thing that I ought to give it to Andrew. All the rest of us are the same as usual  Mattie and the babies are very well. the little one is growing finely and is getting to be quite a youngster  Hattie is growing up well  I often wish you was at home  I think you would enjoy her very much and it would be beneficial to her  Jess is about the same. He is not very strong, but does not get worse I think. I should like to have one of the old fashioned letters from you, and cannot you send me the letter to go to Davis<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> before the 12th as the steamer goes out then</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did you write to Wm Davis at Worcester, if not wont you do so,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> and if you have leasure write to Mr Kirkwood sometime if you will<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>  I will give you his address  Mr Kirkwood is travelling around the eastern states on horseback and is not very well. I think a letter from you would do him good. Let me hear from you. I will write you again to-morrow.</p>

                    (1807–1877), a prominent civil engineer and cofounder of the American
                    Society of Civil Engineers (1852), superintended the construction of the
                    Brooklyn Water Works as chief engineer from 1856 to 1862. After his work in
                    Brooklyn, he moved to St. Louis and designed the waterworks which Jeff would
                    later build. Kirkwood eventually became a nationally known independent
                    consultant and wrote the standard text on water filtration. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00424_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00424_n2"><span>Joseph Phineas Davis
                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend of Jeff's, he became city engineer of Boston
                    (1871–80) and completed his distinguished career as chief engineer of the
                    American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1880–1908). Whitman probably did
                    not write this letter to Joseph Davis; he makes no reference to it in either his
                    correspondence or his diary. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00424_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00424_n3"><span>See Thomas Jefferson
