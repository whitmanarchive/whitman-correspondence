                <span class="tei_salute">My dear W.W.</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your good letter (so kind of you to remember me in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my</span> loneliness of grim work) rec'd this Eve. Mrs K. is in Boston at a Symphony Concert
                and a precious ½ hour for my soul being at my disposal I feel a strong inner
                impulse to pour out here in the evening solitude, my heart to you in a genuine
                heart-letter of affection, welling up out of the of the deeps you long ago touched
                as no other ever did or can. Dear friend whom I have for so long admired, do you not
                feel that all is well with you &amp; the great cause of freedom for which you have
                laid down yr life? I do. I feel somehow that the future is going to be with you, with
                us. Humanity is sweeping on into the larger light. To we who have drank at all
                fountains of literature, the world over, &amp; climbed the lonely peaks of thought
                in every land &amp; age, your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> still towers
                up above everything else in grand aspiration, right philosophy, &amp; the heart
                beats of true liberty. Hugo does not satisfy, he saddens &amp;
                depresses me. He is a giant of despair, the limner of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">scélerats</span> (rascals &amp; beggars chiefly)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You are very kind to offer to send me the new big vol. I shall prize it highly. I hope you
                will pardon the brevity &amp; inadequacy of my notice of "Nov. B." in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Transcript</span>. I am really ill with hard work—nerves
                trembling, eye fluttering &amp; above all sleepy. The rush of Holiday printing will
                be over in a month I hope, &amp; then I shall be able to breathe again. We are
                rolling out 90–100 books at once, &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">every page</span>
                must pass under my eye twice &amp; receive my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fecit</span> before it goes
                out,—my guarantee.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Burroughs writes me that I had better come &amp; raise fruit,—buy land
                adjoining him. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Perhaps I may</span> some time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How I wish you were going to live 50 yrs more. You may hold out 25 yrs yet, I shldn't wonder. Live &amp; make us happy, noble friend. You are the only great
                literatus left alive in the world just at present. We can't spare you. The Infinite
                must wait.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I must stop &amp; copy a page or so (my daily stint) of my Whitman bibliography
                (sawdusty job rather, but of some little use I hope). Wife is well as can be &amp;
                we are cheery &amp; busy. Regards to all friends.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Goodbye once more. I press yr hand,</span>

                <p class="tei_p">Baxter &amp; Prof Morse must be having a jolly nice thing of it in Berlin, "Soft
                        snap"—this globe jogging &amp; junketing is. I feel glad for good solid,
                    moral Baxter. He will enjoy the trip, &amp; I repeat Horace's ode ("Sic Te diva
                    potens Cypri" &amp;c) for his safe return.</p>
