            <p class="tei_p">I received your welcome letter, and was happy to know that you had not forgotten me—for I have thought of you many times since. I returned here from New York about four weeks ago, 
                and have been and now am working in this office as usual—am well and hearty, 
                and don't hurt myself with hard work. Our hours are from 9 till 3.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You speak of coming here and paying me a visit. Dear boy, I hope you will come truly, 
                for it would be a great comfort to me if we could be together again. I don't know whether 
                it would be very pleasant to you here, Jack, for this is a stupid place compared to New York—but we would have each other's society, and that would be first rate.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">There's not much excitement in Washington—at least none that I take any interest in. 
                Politics and politicians carry the day here—but I meddle with them very little. 
                In a couple of weeks more, Congress will meet, and then the city will be quite lively.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am out a good deal in the open air, as I have plenty of leisure time. 
                It is fine scenery around Washington—plenty of hills, and a noble river. 
                I take a ride on the cars out to Georgetown west, or Navy Yard east, once in a while 
                of a pleasant afternoon, or Sunday—but I tell you I miss New York. 
                We had a long spell of splendid weather. But now it is colder, with some 
                snow a couple of days since. Jack, you must write often as you can—anything from my loving boy will be welcome—you needn't be particular about the writing—you might write in the car with pencil, when you have any time. I will write to you too. 
                I will now close for this time. Dear Jack, I send you my love.
            </p>

                    streetcar conductor in New York, known, according to an unidentified notation on
                    his letter to Walt Whitman, as "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an
                    address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
                    Congress, Notebook #109), Walt Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and
                    October 5, 1868, and rode with him on his Second Avenue car; Flood had been a
                    conductor for ten years. After Walt Whitman's return to Washington, there was a
                    brief correspondence, consisting of four extant letters from Walt Whitman (dated
                        <a href="loc.01595">December 12, 1868</a>, <a href="loc.01596">February 23, 1871</a>, and <a href="loc.01597">March 8, 1871?</a>)
                    and one from the young man. Flood, somewhat better educated than some of Walt
                    Whitman's other conductor friends, wrote on <a href="yal.00124">January 11,
                        1869</a>: "Sir, It is with great pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand
                    to address a few lines to you." He informed Walt Whitman that he had lost his
                    position on New Year's Eve and that he was now seeking another job: "I shall
                    still continue to correspond and can never forget your kind friendship towards
                    me.…Your True and Ever intimate friend." According to the first listing of
                    his name in the New York Directory, in 1872–1873, he was at that time
                    either in the milk business or a milkman. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
