            <p class="tei_p">Yours of June 28 just rec'd, &amp; welcomed. I forgot
                what I wrote ab't the P[all] M[all] Gaz.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—but it was not for publication, (&amp; especially not as coming from me.) I
                consider myself as most handsomely treated all round, by friends &amp; upholders in
                Britain &amp; in America—We are having fearfully hot weather here &amp; I am
                suffering from it—Just at this moment it is clouded—a great
                relief—H Gilchrist is here finishing his portrait of me
                to take back to England—it is mighty good both as likeness &amp; work—I
                am writing a little—small bits—will post them to you, when
                printed—</p>
