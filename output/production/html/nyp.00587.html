                    T. Stead, editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pall Mall Gazette</span>, printed an
                    excerpt from a private correspondent (probably Moncure D. Conway) alleging that
                    Americans were not as generous as they should be in their gifts to Walt Whitman.
                    Herbert Gilchrist, the son of Anne Gilchrist and an artist of sorts, arrived in
                    New York on May 27, and appeared in Camden on June 3. For the next several
                    months Gilchrist worked on the portrait now in the Rare Book Department of the
                    University of Pennsylvania. It is reproduced in Harold W. Blodget and Sculley
