                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Poet:</span>
            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">I spent last evening in fighting for you, in reading you, and, in a feeble way,
                expounding you. I had a little company, comprising the membership of an intelligent
                reading club ignorant, however, for the most part, of your works—to whom I
                gave some account of your literary purposes, accompanied with readings from your
                works. The more melodious passages I had read by sweet-voiced women, and the robust
                passages by men with good strong voices; and some who came, perhaps, to snicker
                remained to listen with parted lips. Nevertheless, though the reading passed for a
                success, we had the stock questions to answer, and the stock objections, to
                interpose your own strong words against. One man said you had early had your head
                turned by excessive adulation! I told him that you had had at least enough of the
                other thing to bring up the balance, and that moreover, adulation would as soon turn
                the head of <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Moosilanke​ </span></span>,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> my big mountain up north, as yours.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, all this is vain to you. Neither you nor the Leaves of Grass are on trial any
                more. But it occurred to me that you might be willing to know that reading clubs in
                Massachusetts are reading you and wrangling over you: and I desired to thank you for
                the word which you sent to us through your friend—I cannot now recall his
                name<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—to whom Rev. Mr. DeLong<a href="#n3335" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3335">3</a> wrote, and who kindly
                replied. Your cheery "God help 'em!" gave us a breath of you. My friend Baxter<a href="#n6000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6000">4</a> sent us his copy of your big book<a href="#n4195" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4195">5</a> with notes, one or two, from
                you, pasted in.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You do not know me, but your friends Baxter, Sloane Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">6</a>,
                    Garland<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a> and Ernest Rhys<a href="#n4152" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4152">8</a> are all
                very good friends of mine, and we have for a good while celebrated you here and
                elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you my heartiest wishes for the prolongation of your noble life in content and
                in as great a measure of health as possibly can come to you.</p>

                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for

                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen

                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
