                    sculptor to create, without benefit of foreign training, an impressive body of
                    good work." Ward informed Whitman on <a href="loc.01981">April 23,
                        1876</a>, that on May 1, 1876, he would order five sets of the new
                    edition. The order was sent on <a href="loc.01982">June 1, 1876</a>.
                    Whitman noted receipt of $50 from Ward on June 6, 1876 (Commonplace Book,
