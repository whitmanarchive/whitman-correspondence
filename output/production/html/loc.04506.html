                on Stevens Street, &amp; it has really been nearly three years three years, this
                coming August since I left Camden. Time has flown so rapidly that it seems but a

            <p class="tei_p">Your photograph greets me every time I go into my brother's office I have it hung
                there so we can both see it, &amp; you do not know how many people know you way out,
                in this western country.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One of my friends came in the other day &amp; said, "you have still got his picture

                go <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">with me</span>". it reminds me of so many pleasant chats with

            <p class="tei_p">The first year I came out I was a cowboy, &amp; altho' it is a very prosaic life,
                still I have some very pleasant reminiscences of that time. I have been out on the
                prairie with no house or food in sight when night came &amp; had nothing to do but
                to roll up in my blankets &amp; make the best of it, then again, horse breaking is
                one of the hardest times of the cowboys life.

                you have to get up &amp; conquer the horse before you stop in spite of all the hard

                wealth in the cattle business, but for a cowboy—only, a small ranche with a
                smaller number of cattle, to look forward to—after years of hard &amp;
                unceasing labor still a cowboy is always happy, contented &amp; what is the best of
                all—the finest &amp; constant friend, when you call upon him, that a man can

                scenery I think was the grandest that I ever saw. It was just magnificent. I thought
                how Mr Whitman would like to see it. At times we would be going through some deep,
                dark cañon &amp; then we would burst forth into the full glory of sun as we
                hastened over a level stretch of praire, then we would slowly slowly be going up a

                hard &amp; objects flying by you like magic. I remember one morning we reached the
                top of the San Fransica Mts. just as the sun was rising &amp; it was grand to feel
                the sun &amp; look down the valley when all was as yet in complete darkness with the
                sun slowly ascending &amp; giving its light to the earth below. One place I remember
                well &amp; that was Cañon Diablo a great rent in the Earth 300 ft deep and 100

                down that fearful hole your imagination will conjure up ideas that you would not

                not described the town of Albuquerque &amp; I will not attempt to do so, as I can
                never describe anything correctly, but will send you a magazine that I have sent for
