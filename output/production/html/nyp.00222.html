                    (1820–1899), secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed
                    Whitman from his second-class clerkship on <a href="nyp.00222">June 30,
                        1865</a>. Harlan apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> which Whitman was revising and which he
                    kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant
                    Attorney General J. Hubley Aston, Whitman secured a position in the attorney
                    general's office. The Harlan episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The
                    Good Gray Poet." Although Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman
                    may have sarcastically applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865,
                    Harlan had issued an official directive asking for the names of employees who
                    disregarded "in their conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum
                    &amp; propriety prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Champion</span> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
                    University Press, 1978], 57). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
