            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd the letter you wrote last Wednesday<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—It has been rainy weather again here, &amp; plenty of mud—Sunday afternoon I was at the Hospital—that young man that was so low with bleeding at the lungs, Kephart,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> was easier—he was very bad just after I wrote last week—but Sunday it seemed as though he might recover yet if he had good luck—he has written to his folks at Harper's Ferry, West Va.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I went up to the Capitol Sunday night—Congress was in full blast in both houses—they paid no more attention to its being Sunday, than if it was any other day—which I thought a very good sign—the Radicals have passed their principal measures over the President's vetos—as you will see in the papers. There is much talk about impeachment—but I think it is very doubtful if there is any impeachment<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">O mother, I must not forget to tell the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">great news among Clerks</span> (far more important than Reconstruction, 
                or impeaching Andy)—that is, we are going to have 20 percent addition to our pay, for the present year—that is, I shall get quite a handsome little sum, back pay, &amp; about $25 additional, a month, till 1st of July next—if I stay here. We havnt got the money yet, but I suppose it is sure—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I like my boarding house very well, take it altogether—we have a tip-top table—&amp; the folks are kind &amp; accommodating.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The Old Congress went out yesterday, &amp; the new one (the 40th) organized right away—the Republicans have a strong majority<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is dark &amp; rainy this forenoon here—snow &amp; drizzle—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, you must not imagine any thing about me—I am having good times enough—"eat well &amp; sleep well," as Dr. Ruggles<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> says—&amp; have a pocket full of money—which you can call upon when you want any—as I look out of the window while I write, I see we are having a little snow for a change—So good bye for this time, mother dear—Love to George &amp; Jeff &amp; all,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>
