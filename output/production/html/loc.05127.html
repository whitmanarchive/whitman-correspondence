                    and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
                    known. See Andrew C. Higgins, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    enthusiasm for Whitman's just-published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems and
                        Prose</span>. Whitman decided to have Bucke's letter printed for distribution
                    among his friends and disciples, and he titled it "An impromptu criticism on the
                    900 page Volume, 'The Complete Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman,' first issued
                    December, 1888." The first printing had several typos, including the addition of
                    an acute accent over the first "e" of "Goethe," so Whitman had the errors
                    corrected in a second printing that was completed by January 2, 1889. See Horace
