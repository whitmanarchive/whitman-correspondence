                    in Laurel Springs (near Glendale), New Jersey, and was sometimes accompanied by
                    Herbert Gilchrist; in the 1880s, the Staffords sold the farm and moved to nearby

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
