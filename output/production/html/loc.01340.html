                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letters have been rec'd  &amp; Alys's  also—&amp; have given me
                comfort—So full of living buoyancy &amp; youth—I see <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">those qualities</span>—or the tally of them—are the
                important matter, &amp; then the circumstances &amp; happenings may be whatever may
                chance—The son [—] a friend of mine [—] of the proprietor of the paper here asked me
                to "help him out" in yesterday's paper—so I gave
                him the letter to print—I enclose you the slip—how well &amp; off-hand
                it reads <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01340.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01340.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01340.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>—I
                am living here in my den in Mickle Street the same as ever—A little
                episode—the 9-month-old baby grandson of Mrs. Lay (my housekeeper) was
                attacked with cholera infantum &amp; brain trouble a week ago—the doctor
                insisted on a change of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">locale</span>—they lived in hot
                close rooms—so the babe &amp; mother &amp; two other children are here the
                past week—&amp; the babe (an exceptionally fine one), is out of
                danger—but it has been a close shave—the doctor comes twice a
                day—says it has been <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">house</span> &amp; back yard, (very nice &amp;
                breezy—we have had a hammock swung there), that has done most of the
                curing—Are you interested in the episode? I have been much.</p>
