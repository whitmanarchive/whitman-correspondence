            <p class="tei_p">I have your card of 25 May<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—Last week Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">2</a> came
                to town and I spent a day with him at Alfred Withers' (do you recollect him at
                London) in Hyde Park &amp;c. We had a good talk and dinner together down
                town—Then last Sunday I spent most of the day and dined at Herbert Gilchrists<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">3</a>
                and Carpenter was there. I am now making a few short visits in the country, shall
                return to London 21 and sail 30th—expect to see you about 15, 16 or 17 July
                and want you to be ready to go to Canada with me so as to avoid the heat of August
                and September in Camden—you may go home again as soon as you like after 1 oct.
                but I must insist on your going with me for the two hot months—Now please do
                not think of refusing to go but make all necessary arrangements and we will move
                Northward as soon as convenient after I get across the water—My health has
                improved quite a good deal and I trust it will keep on the same tack<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a></p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
