            <p class="tei_p">I have your card of 25 May—Last week Carpenter came
                to town and I spent a day with him at Alfred Withers' (do you recollect him at
                London) in Hyde Park &amp;c. We had a good talk and dinner together down
                town—Then last Sunday I spent most of the day and dined at Herbert Gilchrists
                and Carpenter was there. I am now making a few short visits in the country, shall
                return to London 21 and sail 30th—expect to see you about 15, 16 or 17 July
                and want you to be ready to go to Canada with me so as to avoid the heat of August
                and September in Camden—you may go home again as soon as you like after 1 oct.
                but I must insist on your going with me for the two hot months—Now please do
                not think of refusing to go but make all necessary arrangements and we will move
                Northward as soon as convenient after I get across the water—My health has
                improved quite a good deal and I trust it will keep on the same tack</p>
