            <p class="tei_p">Willy Gurd has gone East. Left here this morning on 11.30 train,
                goes direct to N.Y., will spend a couple of days there buying certain material
                wanted for meter, then proceed to Danbury to construct
                gas meter. About end of May he ought to be through and if all goes well I may be
                East again in June or July. [—] I send you today a copy of my Annual report,
                after you have looked it over let Horace have it—I have
                only a very few copies so cannot send one to Each as I intended—tell H. to
                show it to anyone he knows of who wants to see it. It is warmer today, snow nearly
                gone, spring may set in in earnest soon now tho' it is still very early with us for
                any growth. I am well, getting a good rest since my return home, sleep about 10
                hours a night right along. Am still very much occupied all day so that I have time
                to read only a very little—Am just finishing "Wieland" [by] Chas. Brockden
                Brown [/] first of his I ever read (got a set of his books from M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">c</span>Kay more than a year ago but never
                looked at them till now)—it is one of the most ghastly books conceivable, old
                (Castle of ontranto) style. No doubt you have read some of Brown's books if not all
                of them. [—] A gloomy but pleasant afternoon here
                as I sit at my desk in my office and look out the window, roads very sloppy with the
                melting snow. I hope you are prospering but I fear you are not to any marked
                extent</p>
