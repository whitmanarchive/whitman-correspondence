            <p class="tei_p">I was very sorry not to have seen you yesterday before you left, because the 
                enclosed answer came from Westermann, 
                and I wanted to consult with you as to the steps to be taken.
                I think a package ought to be made up at once for

                Ferdinand Freiligrath, and we can send it through Westermann, 
                reimbursing him for any expense of transportation. I suppose it would be best to 
                have it done by my agency, and I suggest that I write F. F. a letter, (to go with 
                the package), explaining things generally, and making 
                him as far as possible, master

                of the situation. What do you think? I am sorry I did not know you were going 
                yesterday, because we could have arranged it all better than now.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Preserve the enclosed. I think the sooner we do what is to be done (if anything) 
                regarding F. F., the better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I write hurriedly, just on the edge of mail

                time. No letters for you today at the Attorney General's. I hope you'll have a 
                good time. Give my love to your mother. John came in yesterday 
                to bid me tell you to come up to his house before you left. I did not then know 
                you had gone. He will be disappointed.</p>
