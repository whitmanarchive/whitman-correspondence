                    poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his <a href="rlc.00001">January 16, 1872</a> letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
                    wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." Freiligrath's review in the

                    poetry on the continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Eclectic Magazine</span>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see

                    Walter Grünzweig's "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects numerous
                    examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
                    readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
                    translation. A sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sonntagsblatt</span> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
                    for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for

                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
