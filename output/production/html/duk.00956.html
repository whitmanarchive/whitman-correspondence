                    (1845–1921) came to see Whitman on April 21, "inviting me to write for
                    Lippincott's magazine" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.). Whitman sent "Old Age Echoes" "(4 pieces, 'sounds of winter,'
                    'the unexpress'd,' 'to the sunset-breeze' and 'after the argument')." On April
                    28 he agreed to Stoddart's request that the poems be printed separately
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), and on
                    the following day, <a href="loc.04669">April 29</a>, the editor paid
                    Whitman $60. "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00140.html">Old-Age Echoes</a>" was published in March, 1891; "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">To the Sun-Set Breeze</a>" was in the December, 1890 issue; apparently
                    "After the Argument" was not printed. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
