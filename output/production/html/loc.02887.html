                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    (Herbert, Beatrice, and Grace) from England to Philadelphia. The family lived in
                    Philadelphia from 1876 to 1878; Whitman visited their home almost daily and even
                    had his own room. From April 1878, to 1879, the Gilchrists lived in Concord,
                    Boston, and New York, before returning to England. Anne's son Herbert
                    (1857–1914) remained in America and lived in Philadelphia, maintaining a
                    close relationship with Whitman; after Whitman's death in 1892, he returned to

                        with his publishers and distributors in the 1870s were extremely fraught,
                        and as a result, a large number of his unsold books changed hands several
                        times. In 1873, Whitman entrusted his books to Asa K. Butts &amp; Co., which
                        went into bankruptcy in the following year. Thomas O'Kane, a New York book
                        dealer, assumed possession of the books from Butts, as well as a number of
                        books from Michael Doolady, a New York bookseller and publisher.
                    Though Walt Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on <a href="loc.01717">April 22, 1874</a>, he later became hostile. Citing only the
                        initials, Richard Maurice Bucke, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span>
                        (1883), his "official" biography, averred that O'Kane and Somerby,
                        Butts's successor, "took advantage of [Walt Whitman's] helplessness to
                        embezzle the amounts due—(they calculated that death would soon settle the
                        score and rub it out)" (46). After his difficulties with publishers and agents,
                        in 1875, Whitman decided to self-publish and -distribute <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> in 1876.
                        In Whitman's <a href="yal.00279">December 30, 1875</a>, letter to
                        Jeannette Gilder, Whitman justified his decision, writing that "No
                        established publisher in the country will print my books, &amp; during the
                        last three years of my illness &amp; helplessness every one of the three
                        successive book agents I have had in N.Y. has embezzled the
