            <p class="tei_p">Superb sunny day—Expect Dr B[ucke] here to day—continue on myself badly enough—catarrhal 
                crises—nights not so bad—made 
                my breakfast of a saucer of sliced peaches—Intend to finish out (bind) L of G with 
                "Good Bye" &amp; last of all "Backward Glance" 
                &amp; shall then let it go as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">completed</span> as I can make it—am not writing any 
                thing for print—the setting up for W O'Connor's 
                book of tales (3) 
                has started in Boston—will include "The Carpenter"—Mrs. Davis 
                has just come in to bring me a nice big glass tumbler of crab-apple jelly—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1891-09-04">Sunset</span>—Dr Bucke has come, hearty &amp; cheery as ever—has just gone 
                with Traubel—after over two hours—Mrs. O'C and Dr &amp; T 
                &amp; I—have had my 4½ meal with zest—we all send best respects &amp; love to you &amp; to
                the friends—
