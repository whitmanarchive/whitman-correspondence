            <p class="tei_p">Have just had my 2d meal, mutton and rice stew, wet Graham toast, &amp;c.; 
                relished fairly—drank a little of the Rhine wine—take the granules 
                (3 to-day). No motion of the bowels now, I think, five perhaps six days. 
                To-day easier (negative)—freer from the horrible deathly sinkiness 
                of yesterday and Thursday—have been sitting up reading and writing 
                all day—had one or two visitors, excused myself.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Horace Traubel still in Canada, having a good time I guess. 
                Expect him back last of the coming week. A half–medical acquaintance was in—said, 
                "You look all right—surely there's nothing the matter with your health!" 
                Didn't know whether to take it as compliment or the other thing. 
                (Ah! this immovable block of constipation.)
