                relished fairly—drank a little of the Rhine wine—take the granules 
                (3 to-day). No motion of the bowels now, I think, five perhaps six days. 
                To-day easier (negative)—freer from the horrible deathly sinkiness 
                of yesterday and Thursday—have been sitting up reading and writing 
                all day—had one or two visitors,<a href="#n5001b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001b">1</a> excused myself.</p>

                "You look all right—surely there's nothing the matter with your health!" 
                Didn't know whether to take it as compliment or the other thing.

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
