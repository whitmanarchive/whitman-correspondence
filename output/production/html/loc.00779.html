            <p class="tei_p">My honest thanks to you, Hugo,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> for your letter posting me up not only about yourself but about my dear boys, Fred, Nat Bloom<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—always so welcome to me to hear personally or in any way any &amp; every item about them. Dear friend, the same evening I rec'd your letter, I saw in the New York papers (which get here about 5 every evening) the announcement of Charles Chauncey's death.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> When I went up to my room that night towards 11 I took a seat by the open window in the splendid soft moonlit night, and, there alone by myself, (as is my custom sometimes under such circumstances), I devoted to the dead boy the silent cheerful tribute of an hour or so of floating thought about him, &amp; whatever rose up from the thought of him, &amp; his looks, his handsome face, his hilarious fresh ways, his sunny smile, his voice, his blonde hair, his talk, his caprices—the way he &amp; I first met—how we spoke together impromptu, no introduction—then our easy falling into intimacy—he with his affectionate heart thought so well of me, &amp; I loved him then, &amp; love him now—I thought over our meetings together, our drinks &amp; groups so friendly, our suppers with Fred &amp; Charley Russell<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> &amp;c. off by ourselves at some table, at Pfaff's<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> off the other end—O how charming those early times, adjusting our friendship, I to the three others, although it needed little adjustment—for I believe we all loved each other more than we supposed—Chauncey was frequently the life &amp; soul of these gatherings—was full of sparkle, &amp; so good, really witty—then for an exception he would have a mood come upon him &amp; right after the outset of our party, he would grow still &amp; cloudy &amp; up &amp; unaccountably depart—but these were seldom—then I got to having occasionally quite a long walk with him, only us two, &amp; then he would talk well &amp; freely about himself, his experiences, feelings, quite confidential, &amp;c. All these I resumed, sitting by myself.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hugo, that's the way I sat there Wednesday night till after midnight (the pleasant Virginia breeze coming up the Potomac) and certainly without what they call mourning thought of the boy.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Hugo, you speak of your all remembering me and wish to see me, it would be happiness for me to be with you all, at one of your friendly meetings, especially at Fred's room,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> so pleasant, with its effect I remember of pictures, fine color, &amp;c. to have the delight of my dear boys' company &amp; their gayety &amp; electricity, their precious friendship, the talk &amp; laughter, the drinks, me surrounded by you all, (so I will for a moment fancy myself,) tumbled upon by you all, with all sorts of kindness, smothered with you all in your hasty thoughtless, magnificent way, overwhelmed with questions, Walt this, Walt that, &amp; Walt every thing. Ah, if one could float off to New York this afternoon. It is Sunday afternoon now, &amp; perhaps you are at this moment gathered at Fred's or at your house, &amp; having a good time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you were at Charles Chauncey's funeral—tell me about it, &amp; all particulars about his death. When you write, tell.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>
            </p>

                    . Until the date of
                    Chauncey's death is established, this letter cannot be dated precisely. In the
                    absence of this information we have placed it next to the dated letter to

                    . Since at this point
                    Whitman noted in the draft: "reserve for Fred Gray," he probably intended to
                    include the material in another letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00779_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00779_n4"><span>See the letter from <a href="loc.00768">May 5, 1863</a>

                    opened—about 1854—a restaurant on Broadway near Bleecker Street
                    which shortly became a famed meeting place for literary and theatrical people.
                    In "Pfaff's privy," as the wits described it, in the late 1850s, Henry Clapp was
                    king and Ada Clare was queen of the bohemians(see "Letter from Walt Whitman to
                    William D. O'Connor, 5 May 1867" and "Letter from Walt Whitman to William D.
                    O'Connor, 15 September 1867," Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span>, 1:327–329 and 338–340). Here Whitman met
                    writers like Howells, Stoddard, and Aldrich, editors like Garrison (see "Letter
                    from Walt Whitman to William D. O'Connor, 15 September 1867," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, 1:338–340) and John Swinton (see Whitman's
                    letter from <a href="bos.00006">February 23, 1863</a>), and eccentrics
                    like Count Adam Gurowski (see his letter from <a href="nyp.00206">May 7,
                        1866</a>). "My own greatest pleasure at Pfaff's was to look on—to
                    see, talk little, absorb," Whitman observed to Horace Traubel (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961],
                    1:417). Here too his nonliterary friends like Fritsch also assembled for their
                    "orgies."For accounts of the Pfaffian days, see William Winter, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Old Friends, Being Recollections of Other Days</span> (New York:
                    Moffat, Yard, 1909), 63–106; W. L. Alden, "Some Phases of Literary New

                    difficulties in deciphering this draft letter—"it was so criss-crossed and
                    interlined." Whitman could not remember the date: "I think it was in
                    '63—about the same time as the other." When Horace Traubel finished
                    reading this letter aloud, "Walt's eyes were full of tears. He wiped the tears
                    away with the sleeve of his coat. Put on a make-believe chuckle" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman and
