                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr Whitman</span>    
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">If I have been tardy in seeming rembrance of you &amp; your deserts it is because during the past decade of years I
                have been myself among the breakers; and clouds, tempests, &amp; darkness have been
                about me; but now I once more see the sun.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I beg your acceptance of the enclosed &amp; though but trifling, it will nevertheless
                show what my feelings are &amp; what more I would like to do.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You remember Wells—of Fowler &amp; Wells Phrenologists. Through him &amp; other
                of your friends, in Bolton, (though never having had the
                pleasure to meet you, personally) I have always felt that I knew you. Your good
                deeds to our country were during the war &amp; under circumstances more trying and
                perilous than mine; which were before; &amp; because of which, war came; for had
                Kansas been made a Slave State, there would never have been war: the Country would
                have become all Slave!—I was in the struggle to prevent Kansas being made a
                Slave State &amp; my name must have been known to you in those days &amp;
                familiar.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer"> 
                <span class="tei_salute">I am, dear friend Very Sincerely Yours,</span>
