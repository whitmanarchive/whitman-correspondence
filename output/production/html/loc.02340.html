            <p class="tei_p">If I have been tardy in seeming rembrance of you &amp; your deserts it is because during the past decade of years I
                have been myself among the breakers; and clouds, tempests, &amp; darkness have been
                about me; but now I once more see the sun.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I beg your acceptance of the enclosed<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">1</a> &amp; though but trifling, it will nevertheless
                show what my feelings are &amp; what more I would like to do.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You remember Wells<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—of Fowler &amp; Wells Phrenologists.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Through him &amp; other

                pleasure to meet you, personally) I have always felt that I knew you. Your good
                deeds to our country were during the war &amp; under circumstances more trying and
                perilous than mine; which were before; &amp; because of which, war came; for had
                Kansas been made a Slave State, there would never have been war: the Country would
                have become all Slave!—I was in the struggle to prevent Kansas being made a
                Slave State &amp; my name must have been known to you in those days &amp;

                    (1816–1901) was an abolitionist and industrialist. Born in New Jersey,
                    Hyatt moved to Kansas in the 1850s with a plan to develop local industry, where
                    he befriended abolitionist John Brown. Following Brown's execution in 1859,
                    Hyatt raised funds to support Brown's widow and children and was brought to
                    Washington, D.C., to testify before the U.S. Senate committee investigating the
                    events at Harper's Ferry. After refusing to testify, he was jailed at Capitol
                    Prison for three months. Upon release, he briefly served as American consul at
                    La Rochelle, France, before building a home in London using his own patented
                    concrete. There, he developed the translucent paving tiles that made him a small
                    fortune. During the last years of his life, Hyatt divided his time between
                    Brooklyn and the British Isles and died in 1901 while vacationing with his
                    family on the Isle of Wight. He is the author of several books, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Prayer of Thaddeus Hyatt to James Buchanan, President of

                    Cohocton, New York, and well-known phrenologists. They established a
                    Phrenological Cabinet in Clinton Hall in New York City in 1842, where Whitman
                    received a phrenological examination in 1849. The Fowlers' brother-in-law Samuel
                    R. Wells also joined the firm, which later came to be known as Fowler and Wells.
                    The firm published numerous books and magazines on phrenology, reform, and
                    self-help topics, and anonymously published Whitman's second edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1856. For more information, see
