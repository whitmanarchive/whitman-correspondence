            bring up her children)

            go out and get in the cars
            and so i went up to spencer 
                st and called on mrs moore
                samuel moores mother
                you
            remember they lived in the
            big house with us a while

            the worst of it was they had
            two dogs and before they could
            get them away i thought they
            would have torn my gown
            off of me first one jumped
            up on me and then the other
            finally the old man had 
            to take them by the neck and
            legs and put them out in
            the yard the old man and
            mrs more wished to be
            remembered to all of you
            boys) i see the death of mrs
            fleet Johns mother
                they
            lived on the south side
            where she died) there is quite
            a stir about the small pox
            ordering every one to be
                vasinated) well walter dear
