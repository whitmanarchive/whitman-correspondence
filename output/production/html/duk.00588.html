                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year
                    1870. Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:367). However, the delay in Louisa's comments on the death of
                    Hannah Fleet and on a public outcry over smallpox vaccination raises some doubt
                    about the date. Louisa almost always comments on recent local news within days,
                    but the two matters that she mentions in this letter date to newspaper stories
                    on January 6 and 7. The year 1870 is certain, but the letter may date earlier
                    than January 19. Nonetheless, because the date is in Louisa's hand, the letter
                    is assigned the date January 19, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    fear that her daughter-in-law would not live long enough to see her children
                    reach adulthood would prove prophetic. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that led
                    to her death in February 1873. At the time of her death, her daughter Manahatta
                    was aged 12 years and her daughter Jessie Louisa 9 years. For Louisa's anguish
