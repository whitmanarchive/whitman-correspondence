                    self-styled "poor clerk in an obscure library" in Melbourne, Australia, wrote
                    for the first time to Walt Whitman on March 12, 1890, although there is extant
                    an unsent draft letter written on August 6, 1889. From his confessions in
                    various letters it is clear that O'Dowd, the son of an Irish policeman, had a
                    lonely and loveless childhood, that he was reared a Roman Catholic only to
                    become a freethinker, that he became a teacher at an early age but then drifted
                    (not unlike Walt Whitman) from job to job, and that despite his marriage the
                    year before in his own eyes he was "a failure" and "an enigma to myself." He saw
                    Walt Whitman as an heroic father figure: "Had Carlyle added another chapter to
                    his 'Hero Worship' the 'Hero as Nurse' with Walt Whitman as subject would have
                    worthily capped his dome" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; A. L. McLeod, ed.,

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
