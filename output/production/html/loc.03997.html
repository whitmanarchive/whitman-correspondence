                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Harry</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent you a few lines three days ago, but I will write again as I have just rec'd
                yours of 26—a little wild &amp; nervous &amp; uncertain some parts, (but I am
                always glad to get any letters from you dear boy)—Harry, you certainly know
                well enough you have my best honorable loving friendship settled—Of the past I
                think only of the comforting soothing things of it all—I go back to the times
                at Timber Creek beginning most five years ago, &amp; the banks &amp; spring, &amp;
                my hobbling down the old lane—&amp; how I took a good turn there &amp;
                commenced to get slowly but surely better, healthier, stronger—Dear Hank I
                realize plainly that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">if I had not known you</span>—if it
                hadn't been for you &amp; our friendship &amp; my going down there summers to the
                creek with you—and living there with your folks, &amp; the kindness of your
                mother, &amp; cheering me up—I believe <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I should not be a
                    living man to-day</span>—I think &amp; remember deeply these things &amp;
                they comfort me—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">&amp; you my darling boy are the central
                    figure of them all</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Of the occasional ridiculous little storms &amp; squalls of the past I have quite
                discarded them from my memory<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—&amp; I hope you
                will too—the other recollections overtop them altogether, &amp; occupy the
                only permanent place in my

                will while life lasts—Harry <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span></span>
                be discouraged by any business or other
                disappointments of the past—It will all turn out right—The main thing,
                in my opinion, after finding out as much as possible of life, &amp; entering upon it
                (it is a strange mixed business this life) is to live a good square one—This I
                believe you are really anxious to do, &amp; God bless you in it, &amp; you shall
                have all the help I can give—Your loving ever-faithful old friend &amp;
                comrade</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I think I am slowly getting over my chill—it is rainy, dark, muggy day,
                    &amp; I am staying in—had a nice call from a young Beverley merchant Mr
                    Hovey<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> yesterday, he bo't a set of

                    &amp; has been some time in the Insane Asylum at Blackwoodtown?—I was out to
                    dinner yesterday to Mr &amp; Mrs Scovel's—turkey and champagne!—but
                    that is the only spree for me in five weeks—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Hank I want you to acknowledge this letter—I hope this won't fail to reach
                    you like some others I have sent—I want to come down before long &amp;
                    then we will have some good square talks—it is now half past 4 &amp; I see
                    the sun is going to set clear<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a></p>
