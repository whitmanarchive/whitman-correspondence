                    preceded by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had been

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).

                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
