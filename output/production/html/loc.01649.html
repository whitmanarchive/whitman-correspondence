                <span class="tei_salute">Dear, dear son,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still here—still suffering pretty badly—have great distress in my
                head, &amp; an almost steady pain in left side—but my worst troubles let up on
                me part of the time—the evenings are my best times—&amp; somehow I
                still keep up in spirit, &amp;, (the same old story,) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">expect</span> to get better. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been discharged from my clerkship in the Solicitor's office, Treasury, by the
                new Solicitor, Mr. Wilson. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I think of laying up here in Camden. I have bought a cheap lot—&amp;
                think of putting up a little two or three room house for myself. My darling son, you must not be unhappy about me—I hope
                &amp; trust things may work so that we can yet be with each other, at least from

                time to time—&amp; meanwhile we must adapt ourselves to circumstances. You
                keep on, &amp; try to do right, &amp; live the same square life you always have,
                &amp; maintain as cheerful a heart as possible—&amp; as for the way things
                finally turn out, leave that to the Almighty—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Pete I shall want you or Mr. Eldridge to see to the sending on here of my boxes at
                Dr. Whites.—I will write further
                about it—I have not heard any thing from Eldridge, or Mrs. O'Connor, or any of
                the Washington folk for quite a long time. Have you been up to see Mrs. O'C. Pete
                didn't you get my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">last Saturday's</span> postal card? I wrote you
                one. I got yours last Monday—Did you get the Camden paper with my College
                piece in? I sent one. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Very hot here yesterday &amp; today.—I don't fret at all about being
                discharged—it is just as well—I wonder it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">didnt​ </span><span class="tei_corr">didn't​
        
      </span></span> come before—How
                are your folks at home—your dear mother &amp; all—write about all,
                &amp; about Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash, Wash Milburn, &amp; the RR boys—</p>
