                    (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
                    1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
                    others, wrote the "indispensable" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in
                        America</span> (1882), and edited <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poetry of America,
                        1776–1876</span> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
                    poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
                        1890—Recollections</span> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
                    in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
                        <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle): "I
                    liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
                    who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." </span></span></p></div>
