                anything the picture seems to me is always looking at me; so I find that I am better

I have but <span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">found a girlfriend</span> and that <span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">is to say, she is a</span> good and true

                was well, and thought of coming over soon. I suppose you know that father has had
                another hemorrhage, but he is better now but he will never be able to do any more

                School at the Haddon institute for sometime

                I will have to close my letter, as the paper is running on so adieu if I
