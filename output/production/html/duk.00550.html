            wrote last week that matty
            wasent very well i suppose
            she has bad spells and
            then she gets better again)

            two letters from the honorable
            Mr Heyde well we wont
            say any thing of the bad but

            with one dollar and she
            cant get ready to come
                to brooklyn till about
