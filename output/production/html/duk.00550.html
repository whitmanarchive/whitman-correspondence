                    Bucke assigned the year and the day of the week, "Monday." Edwin Haviland Miller
                    also dated this letter November 2, 1868 (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp;

                    day," which does not match her date "November 2," because the election was held
                    on Tuesday, November 3, 1868. The year is corroborated by the illness of
                    neighbor Charley Mann, whose death is the subject of Louisa's <a href="duk.00552">November 10, 1868</a> letter to Walt. As the date in
                    Louisa's hand and election day are not compatible, the letter dates to November
                    2 or 3, 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    assured her of the Brooklyn office's honesty, a view that Walt contested in his
