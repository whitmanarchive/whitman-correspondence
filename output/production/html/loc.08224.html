                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    disturbed Bucke, who on January 17 wrote a "Private" letter to the poet's
                    biographer Horace L. Traubel: "How do you account for such gloomy reports f'm W.
                    to me when you see every thing 'coleur de rose'? My impression is that tho'
                    putting (for most part) a good face on things W. is really in a pretty bad way
                    and liable to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">collapse</span> at any time." Again on February 10
                    in a letter for Traubel marked "For yourself only," Bucke expressed his concern
                    about Whitman's health: "I look for a sudden end (when it comes) and I feel
                    satisfied it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">may</span> come any day" (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.). Traubel and Bucke wrote to each other several times a week
                    during the last fifteen months of Whitman's life. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08224_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="loc.08224_n3"><span>See Whitman's letter to
