                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Harry</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">At the request of your mother &amp; from what you wrote some time ago I bundled up
                all the old letters I could find, &amp; Edward Stafford
                stopt here &amp; took them to her—this is over a week ago, (Ed still comes up
                here to school in Phila. to learn bookkeeping)—I believe your folks are all as
                usual—but I suppose you have heard from there, latest particulars. I am
                jogging along pretty much the same as ever—was to the theatre last week, &amp;
                enjoyed it, "Francesca da Rimini"—lots of love-making &amp; hugging in the
                play, done first rate—I quite fell in love with the lady actress (Mary
                    Wainwright)—the actors spied me in front,
                &amp; sent around to ask me to come behind the scenes, which I did at the end of the
                play, &amp; was made much of, especially by Barrett the star—was invited to go
                with him to the Continental to supper—which I declined—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am doing a little in writing—have a little poem in Harpers for March,
                forthcoming, which I will send you—(I sent you the
                Indian piece, I believe)—When you get ready to go
                on further, or to any Western city, or anywhere, I will furnish you with a general
                letter of recommendation, if you wish it—may serve to break the ice, possibly,
                somewhere. I suppose you get the Camden &amp; other papers I send—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> For over a month now we have had rough winter weather here—lately rain &amp;
                fog, most a week—but to-day is bright &amp; fine—I am sitting up in the
                3d story room, Stevens street, in the afternoon sun writing this—Glad you
                write to me in such good spirits, &amp; are well—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they two
                    are every thing</span>—Keep on—explore the big western cities,
                Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis—Denver—even to California—it will do
                you good to see the actual world, &amp; men &amp; affairs—God bless you, dear
                boy—</p>
