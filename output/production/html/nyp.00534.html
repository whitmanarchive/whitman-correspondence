            <p class="tei_p">At the request of your mother &amp; from what you wrote some time ago I bundled up
                all the old letters I could find, &amp; Edward Stafford<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
                stopt here &amp; took them to her—this is over a week ago, (Ed still comes up
                here to school in Phila. to learn bookkeeping)—I believe your folks are all as
                usual—but I suppose you have heard from there, latest particulars. I am
                jogging along pretty much the same as ever—was to the theatre last week, &amp;
                enjoyed it, "Francesca da Rimini"—lots of love-making &amp; hugging in the
                play, done first rate—I quite fell in love with the lady actress (Mary
                    Wainwright)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—the actors spied me in front,
                &amp; sent around to ask me to come behind the scenes, which I did at the end of the
                play, &amp; was made much of, especially by Barrett the star—was invited to go
                with him to the Continental to supper—which I declined<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am doing a little in writing—have a little poem in Harpers for March,
                forthcoming, which I will send you<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—(I sent you the
                Indian piece,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> I believe)—When you get ready to go
                on further, or to any Western city, or anywhere, I will furnish you with a general
                letter of recommendation, if you wish it—may serve to break the ice, possibly,
                somewhere. I suppose you get the Camden &amp; other papers I send—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> For over a month now we have had rough winter weather here—lately rain &amp;
                fog, most a week—but to-day is bright &amp; fine—I am sitting up in the
                3d story room, Stevens street, in the afternoon sun writing this—Glad you
                write to me in such good spirits, &amp; are well—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they two
                    are every thing</span>—Keep on—explore the big western cities,
                Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis—Denver—even to California—it will do
                you good to see the actual world, &amp; men &amp; affairs—God bless you, dear
                boy—</p>

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    the notes below. February 10 fell on Sunday in 1884. Stafford was still in
                    Canada with Richard Maurice Bucke (see the letter from Whitman to Harry Stafford
                    of <a href="med.00666">December 8, 1883</a>). On <a href="loc.03917">February 10</a> he informed the poet that he was suffering from an
                    "abcess in my neck," and asked for a letter of introduction to any one Whitman
                    knew in Detroit: "Don't get the blues worth a dam and don't aspect
                    to."
