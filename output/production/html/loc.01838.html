                (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
                rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
                Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
                Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
                although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
                When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01837">August 13,
                    1874</a>. He informed Whitman that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
                mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes with the usual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lack</span> of
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">flowers</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fruit</span>." See

                    occupied an entire page of the paper (as Whitman alludes to in his <a href="loc.01624">November 28, 1873</a>, letter to Peter Doyle). An
                    editorial in the same issue added biographical details, probably supplied by
                    Whitman himself, and announced the forthcoming publication of the sixth edition

                of January 1872, Whitman had been transferred from his position in the Attorney

                worked as a clerk. The following year, Whitman had a paralytic stroke and was forced
                to take a leave of absence to recover. He returned to his position briefly, but moved
                to Camden, New Jersey a few months later, and petitioned for a friend to subtitute in his place.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
