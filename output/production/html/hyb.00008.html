            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I came up last night from a three days visit to White Horse—went down thinking only to spend the day, but the spring beauty of the creek, skies, weather, trees, birds &amp;c. fascinated me—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling excellent well to-day, for me—have been out to a gay breakfast party (lawyers &amp; ladies &amp; lots of talk, &amp; champagne)—&amp; enjoyed it very well—but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">once</span> of such a thing will last me a long while—got home about one o'clock, (it has now just struck four)—consequence of my gay breakfast is, I have not eat any dinner—but shall go to Col. Johnston's to supper—</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">Thanks to Herbert for his good letters of the 7th from Brooklyn—&amp; the 16th from Northampton—please give him the enclosed postal, I found at White Horse—May-be you will like to read Miss Hillard's letter—so I enclose it—The Staffords are mostly as usual—George S. not very well, but around at work—Debbie not married yet—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You must have fine surroundings indeed at Round Hill—As I close we have the prospect of a fine evening—A cannon has just boomed out on the river, probably an ocean-steam just come in, firing her signal gun—&amp; I am just off to Col. J's, &amp; to leave this at the P O—</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Best love to all—</span>
