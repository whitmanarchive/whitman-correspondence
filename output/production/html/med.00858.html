            <p class="tei_p">Briefly to answer impromptu your request of Oct: 19<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—the question whether I think any American poet not now living deserves a
                place among the thirteen "English inheritors of unassail'd renown" (Chaucer,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Spenser,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Shakspere,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Milton,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> Dryden,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> Pope,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> Gray,<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> Burns,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> Wordsworth,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> Coleridge,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> Byron,<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a> Shelley<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">13</a> and Keats,<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">14</a>)—and which American poets would be truly worthy,
                &amp;c. Though to me the deep of the matter goes down, down beneath. I remember the
                London Times at the time, in opportune, profound and friendly articles on
                    Bryant's<a href="#n15" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r15">15</a> and Longfellow's<a href="#n0367" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0367">16</a> deaths, spoke of the embarrassment, warping effect, and
                confusion on America (her poets and poetic students) "coming in possession of a
                great estate they had never lifted a hand to form or earn"; and the further
                contingency of "the English language ever having annex'd to it a lot of first-class
                Poetry that would be American, not European"—proving then something precious
                over all, and beyond valuation. But perhaps that is venturing outside the question.
                Of the thirteen British immortals mention'd—after placing Shakspere on a sort of pre-eminence of fame not to be invaded yet—the names of
                Bryant, Emerson,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">17</a> Whittier<a href="#n17" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r17">18</a>
                and Longfellow (with even added names, sometimes Southerners, sometimes Western or
                other writers of only one or two pieces,) deserve in my opinion an equally high
                niche of renown as belongs to any on the dozen of that glorious list.</p>
