                    letter to which Bucke is responding is apparently lost—Edwin Haviland
                    Miller lists a missing letter from Whitman to Bucke on 26 January 1880 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 3:434)—it would appear that Whitman had
                    sent Bucke a list of materials for use in the biography. If this is the case,
                    then the following have the special sanction of the poet: John Burroughs, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span>, 1st ed. (New
                    York: American News Company, 1867); "The Flight of the Eagle," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin and Company, 1877),
                    185–235; William Douglas O'Connor, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet: A
                        Vindication</span> (New York: Bunce and Huntington, 1866); and Anne Gilchrist,
                    "An Englishwoman's Estimate of Walt Whitman," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston
                        Radical</span>, 7 (May 1870), 345–59. In the biography, Bucke reprinted
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span> (pp. 99–130) and extracts
                    from "An Englishwoman's Estimate" (pp. 204–6). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_man.00003_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="man.00003_n2"><span>Although Whitman at this
                    time was living with George Washington Whitman at 431 Stevens Street, there was
                    not much sympathy between the brothers. Some notion of the attitude of the
                    family may be gained from the interview with George Washington Whitman that
                    Traubel conducted in 1893 ("Notes from Conversations with George W. Whitman,
                    1893: Mostly in his Own Words," in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re Walt Whitman</span>,
                    eds. Horace Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned [Philadelphia:
                    McKay, 1893], 33–40). Discussing the publication of the first edition of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, George remarked: "I was about
                    twenty-five then. I saw the book—didn't read it all—didn't think it
                    worth reading—fingered it a little. Mother thought as I did—did not
                    know what to make of it" (35). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_man.00003_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_lozynsky tei_note_type_editorial note" id="man.00003_n3"><span>Possibly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
