            <p class="tei_p">A pleasant forenoon as I write, here by the open window. I remain ab't as
                usual—a little pull'd down by the heat perhaps. Your letter came, &amp; was
                welcome, as always—Alys's "circular" came, &amp;
                now one from Romsey arrived this morn'g—I had a letter from Dr B[ucke] two
                days ago— all well—</p>
