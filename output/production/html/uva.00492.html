                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
