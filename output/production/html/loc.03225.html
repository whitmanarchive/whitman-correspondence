                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                        <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
