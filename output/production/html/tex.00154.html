            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have grown better the last four or five days, &amp; don't have that pain in my head now.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, it is the middle of Tuesday afternoon, &amp; the carrier has just brought your letter, (though I see it was written Saturday.) Mother, your letter is the first news I have had of the fire—it must have been quite an exciting time—&amp; quite a sad loss, anyhow—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went to see Ristori, the great actress, the other night, &amp; was very much pleased—but don't want to go again.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It has got pretty cold here the last two days—I wear my big old overcoat. Every thing goes on the same in the office—I have written again to Han—I send her some book or something to read, occasionally—I got a letter from Mrs. Price—Helen is not very well—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I will send you another <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>, with Wm O'Connor's piece in. It seems as if things were going to brighten up about "Leaves of Grass." I rather think it is going to be republished in England.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, you must keep a good heart—and good bye for this time—</p>
