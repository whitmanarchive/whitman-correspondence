                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Grashalme: Gedichte</span> [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of

                    Rolleston's letter of <a href="loc.05537">April 5</a>, in which he spoke
                    of his plans to publish excerpts from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and
                    in which he asked for Whitman's authorization, Whitman wrote two letters to
                    Rolleston. In the first, apparently sent on April 20, he suggested again "the
                    printing of the English text with the German" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). The
                    second letter, evidently mailed on April 22, though the entry in Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book appears under April 20, included an "endorsement to go in R's
                    preface—&amp; recommending that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Salut au Monde</span> be
                    included." Rolleston translated the text of this letter and used it as the
                    poet's "endorsement" of his translation; William Sloane Kennedy then translated
                    the endorsement from the German back into English in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight
                        of a Book for the World</span>, 249–250 (reprinted by Horst Frenz in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</span>
                    [Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1951], 89). Rolleston on May 18
                    agreed to the poet's suggestions (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
