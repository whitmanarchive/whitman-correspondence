                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    wife of William D. O'Connor. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly
                    and her daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came
                    near this time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters.
                    Walt Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years,
                    and he spoke often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or
                    "Jeannie"). Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off
                    their friendship in late 1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies
                    and the role of emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with
                    Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r4305">back</a>]</li><li id="n2002">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n2002 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n2002"><span>William Douglas O'Connor
