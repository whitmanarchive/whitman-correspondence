            <p class="tei_p">I have your card of 17th Have also had a letter from Mrs
                O'Connor telling me about O'C.'s
                exodus to the west. I have just written to her and to O'C. It seems O'C.'s doctors
                are at present telling Mrs O'C. that the disease is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">now</span>
                sclerosis the disease has been Sclerosis <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all along</span> and how

                think) I cannot imagine. It is pitiable to see the poor fellow at this late hour
                going for "change of air" as if that could by any possibility do any good in such a
                case. However it won't do any harm and the change may rouse him up a little for the
                time. He may go on living for months (even quite a few years) yet and the great

All quiet
                here—Country all grown solid again—splendid wheeling smooth hard

                dinner—roast turkey, bread sauce &amp; apple pie—What more could one ask
                for? We are all looking forward to seeing you here by &amp; by—if the

                about the lecture we want to find out what they are thinking about in New York I
                guess it will be all right—they surely will not let the chance go by after
                    Phila letting them send a good example last
