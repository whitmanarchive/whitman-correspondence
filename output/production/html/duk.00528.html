                    date and a return address but was probably written about December 19,
                    1862—the date of Walt Whitman's arrival at Fredericksburg in search of his
                    soldier-brother. In the letter George attempts to allay his mother's fears for
                    his safety. After finding George only slightly wounded, Walt no doubt told him
                    of their family's frantic concern. Fears of equal intensity apparently made the
                    usually arduous journey from Brooklyn to Fredericksburg even more difficult for
                    the poet. Hastening through Philadelphia, Whitman lost all of his money to a
                    pickpocket. And in Washington he spent two days in vain searching the hospitals
                    for George. Finally, the thought occurred to him that George might still be with
                    his regiment near Falmouth (across the river from Fredericksburg) and he went
                    there by government transportation. Before actually finding George, however,
                    Whitman encountered at Falmouth a pile of amputated arms and legs in front of an
                    army hospital. Such a sight would have been shocking at any time but especially
                    when he was uncertain about his brother's safety (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</span>

                    promotion to captain on December 12, 1862—with the date of rank
