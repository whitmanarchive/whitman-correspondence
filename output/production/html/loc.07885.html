                    B[ucke] (it is beautiful)—have
                just rec'd some impressions f'm the plate printer f'm y'r celluloid negative—curiously good &amp; fine, no better work (I often
                say the last best work is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the right press-work</span>)—next
                time you write give me a list of whom you have sent the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes</span>
                to—(I think you have builded better than you knew)—Am getting along
                fairly, even well—am sweating here to night (all right in itself)—steady
