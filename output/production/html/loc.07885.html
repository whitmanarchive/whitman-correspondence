                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
                    published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire

                    (1840–1893), a prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in
                    Victorian England, was author of the seven-volume history <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Renaissance in Italy</span>, as well as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman—A Study</span> (1893), and a translator of Michelangelo's
                    sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class English
                    homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry
                    and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
                    known. See Andrew C. Higgins, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    bring a film before the eyes, through which swims so much of life, of the

                    forces wh' have sustained, &amp; of the failures wh' have saddened. I do not
                    know whether you have seen a short piece of writing by me, in which I said that
                    Whitman's work had influenced me more than any thing in literature except the
                    Bible &amp; Plato. This expresses the mere fact, so far as I can read my inner

                    not seem to corroborate my statement." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07885_n4 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07885_n4"><span>Whitman expresses his
