                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke

                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    "Sister Han has had a bad spell illness— jaundice—is now easier."
                    About this time he received a letter from Heyde about Hannah's indisposition and
                    his (usual) economic problems. See the letter from Heyde to Whitman of <a href="duk.00415">October 1889</a>. Whitman was probably referring to
                    this letter when he wrote on November 8—"Snivelling letters continued
                    (apparently endlessly) f'm the miserable whelp C L H[eyde] (he knows I can't
                    help myself—I never answer them—I feel as if I could crush him out
                    like an offensive bed-bug wh' he is)" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). The
                    invective continued on November 18: "He is the worst nuisance &amp; worriment of
                    my illness —Keeps me back, (his damnable letters) ab't the worst factor of

                    Hannah "(5 for C)," and, apparently in response to two letters from Heyde in
                    December, almost hysterical in their pleas for money, forwarded $2 on
