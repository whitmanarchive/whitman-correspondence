                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    poem to music; Hewitt's song also takes as its title the first line of the
                    poem. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n4284">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4284 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4284"><span>William John Gurd (1845–1903)
                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
                    outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
                    capital investors."
