                saturday and he says he
                cant come till the 1 of the
                month as he is very busy
                has as much as he can
                attend to so edd and i
                will have to hold our
                thanksgiving alone) they
                expect a large company
                to dinner down stairs
                i thought rather strange
                of their inviting so much
                company so soon after the
                death of Charley but people
                has different fancys mrs
                mans sister stays here
