                    November 16 is in her hand. Louisa discussed Charley Mann's death in her <a href="duk.00552">November 10, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman, and she

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
