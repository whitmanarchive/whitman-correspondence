                    New York Cavalry, was confined in Ward C of Armory Square with a gunshot wound
                    in his left leg; see "Notebook: Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection) and "Hospital Notes" (Henry E. Huntington Library). He
                    recovered slowly from his injury. About the end of May in the following year he
                    was sent to Mower Hospital, Chestnut Hill, Pennsylvania, where he remained until
                    he was granted a furlough in August 1864. He later returned to Mower Hospital
                    when he wrote this letter. See also Stilwell's letters to Whitman from <a href="duk.00373">July 5, 1864</a>, and <a href="nyp.00168">September
                        2, 1864</a>. He was the brother of Julia and John Stilwell. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
