            myself i dident hardly expect
                a letter to day as i got one saturday
            we have just had our dinner after
            waiting for george 2 or 3 hours we
            had a peice of beef yesterday and
            had it again to day and shall have
            it till wensday or thursday sometime
            we have a good peice then it aint
            so bad to have it last so long but this
            peice is not very good Lou sends
                orders and eddy goes the errands
            she is down stairs now gets up
            to breakfast when we are nearly over
            walk<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">e</span> around and lays on the sofa
                yesterday she went up to the lot
                to see it george 
            and she it was as much
            as she could doo she said i dont know
                whether she will make out any thing or not</p>

            and very nervious little things
            affects me more than it does some
            people i think since her aunt is 
            here she could dispence with me very
            easily) the other day Lou was saying
            how much butter we used in a week
            and it was so dear she said she was
            shure aunt libby dident eat much
            butter i said dont get any butter when
                its so high) i dont think edd and i
            together eats a quarter of a pound in
            a week he dont get it to eat</p>
            <p class="tei_p">the aunty is helpet to the best and the
            largest sometime i feel bad enoughf
            if i was younger i should show some of
            my dignity now walt write to me
            to morrow and tell me how you are
            getting along walt if you think you
                cant get a house
                for us to live in dont
            worry about me i shall live my allotted
            time) if you ever do get one i think one
            about the size of what i wrote about would
            do and wouldent cost very much with a
            cellar under the 2 rooms and not under the shed
