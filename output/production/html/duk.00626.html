                    21, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter April 21, 1873, which fell on
                    Monday, the day of the week in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Edwin
                    Haviland Miller concurred with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    two recent letters from Walt Whitman, one received on the date of this letter
                    and one received the previous Saturday. The letters that she received were

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871.

                    (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
                    "Mattie" Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n13 note" id="duk.00425_n13"><span>Edward Whitman

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
                    care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
                    financial support from Walt Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00625_n11 note" id="duk.00625_n11"><span>George Washington Whitman
