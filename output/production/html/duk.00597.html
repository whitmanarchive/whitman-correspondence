                    July 5?, 1870, is somewhat speculative. Richard Maurice Bucke estimated the date
                    as July 12, 1870. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver agreed with Bucke's date
                        (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt
                        Whitman and His Family</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
                    1949], 203), and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and Silver's date (Walt
                    Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The letter, however, is more likely to
                    date to a week earlier. The most useful detail for dating the letter is that
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman has had a photograph taken at the studio of William S.
                    Pendleton. She plans to enclose a copy of the photograph in a box that she has
                    prepared for her daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde. According to her firmly dated
                        <a href="duk.00599">July 20, 1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman, she had
                    requested a pickup of Hannah's package by Westcott's Express Tuesday the
                    previous week (July 12). If she prepared Hannah's box on the same day that she
                    has the picture taken, this letter dates to July 12, 1870. Since Louisa, in her
                        <a href="duk.00599">July 20, 1870</a> letter, lamented the difficulty
                    of preparing the package for Hannah, it is unlikely that she would both seek to
                    have her picture taken and on the same day (July 12) have the box sent to
                    Hannah. Therefore, this letter is more likely to date to the preceding Tuesday,
                    July 5, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00597_n5 note" id="duk.00597_n5"><span>No letters from Walt Whitman
