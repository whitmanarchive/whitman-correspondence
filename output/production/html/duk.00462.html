                must not deny yourself any comforts only send what you you can very conveintly spare the fare was much more than i expected it was 12 dollars it used to
                be 7 i begin to feel a little as if i wanted to go back but han wont hear a word about it i have had a letter from Jeffy and one from
                Matty but
                none from george i suppose he is very busy Jeff
                  says he has got a job
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00462.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00462.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00462.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                to new york rather a big job i should think Jeffy says he is not going to doo any thing in the way of building his house this winter i was very sorry to
                hear that as i was in hopes he would have a place of his own he says brick is so
                very high i dont know but what we shall all have to go to birmingham
                to live every thing is so monstrous dear i have heard more about the place to day it
                certainly is quite a desirable place people that has lived here at burlington would not come here to live but likes it there much better there is many
                well off farmers and 
                provitions is  low so a person could live if they had a small income
