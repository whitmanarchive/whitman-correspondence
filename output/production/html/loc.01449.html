            <p class="tei_p">I once more take the liberty of sending you a few lines to enquire if you have
                received the small Box of Books I sent you on the 8th April per Suttons Parcel
                Despatch. I enclose again the list of the contents of the Box. I have been expecting
                a letter from you these 2 weeks, and so thought I had better write you again in case
                they had not reached you safely, because <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01449.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01449.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01449.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01449.002.jpg</span> the longer we delay the report of items
                not arriving safe, the more difficult it becomes to trace where they may have been
                sent to in mistake. I also learn you have written a reply to T. Carlyle's American
                Iliad in a Nutshell. If you possess a Copy of it, I would like to have one, also a
                copy of the original preface to Leaves of Grass. Not now being in possession of the
                original copy of the Poem, I miss the preface from your recent Editions
                much.—In fact I regret very much<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01449.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01449.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01449.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01449.003.jpg</span> that you have excluded the preface from your recent Editions, and
                English Readers would no doubt like to see a Copy of your letter to Emerson on
                American Literature, in reply to his letter to you. Copies of Emersons letter I have
                sent to several friends of mine here interested in your Poems. Are you ever in New
                York? I have at present staying there, if not located there for Life, two friends
                from our town. Men that I know would be glad to see you and who would give you some

                be glad to hear had seen you, and also became friends of yours. there is a certain
                natural talent in them both. one of them has written a few Articles for the Tribune
                on Cooperation and Trade's Unions. The new matters here in a Literary way that may
                be of interest to Note you is the successful result of the Publication of D. G.
                Rossetti's Poems got into the second Edition in 14 Days after first Publication, and
                the next is a series of lectures in the Science of Religion by <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_4">[illegible]</span> appearing in Frasers Mag every month also a great success.
                And last not least the public appearance in London of Chunder Sen the Hindoo Theist, who is now greatly sought after by all classes of advanced
                thinkers in London. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01449.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01449.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01449.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01449.005.jpg</span>
                And through his being here some few advanced thinkers in London (people who admire
                your Countryman Theo Parker's Works) are anxious to inaugrate some Body of People who shall publicly carry out and advocate these
                teachings amongst us, in fact endeavour to form a Body of Religious People who shall
                truly acknowledge in their daily Life and Needs the fellowship and Brotherhood of
                all Men, and God the Father of all. One God, and one Religion, and that Religion in

                leading ideas and thoughts I sympathize with, and live in hopes of seeing someday
                come to pass amongst us all. and Humanity seems fast moving on to that Noble Epoch,
                despite the changes and groans of some of them—I myself largely sympathize
                with the Quaker teaching <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">No Priesthood</span>, and would fain
                know something of your Mind on this Matter, and also of Hicks teachings whose name I
