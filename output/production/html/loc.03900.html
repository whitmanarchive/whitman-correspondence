            <p class="tei_p">We are having an awful spell of weather up here, snow-storms &amp; bitter cold ever
                since Christmas—about the wintriest week I remember take it all
                through—thermometer down below zero, night &amp; day—But I suppose you
                know all about it &amp; have had the same—I still keep well &amp; in good
                trim, thank the Lord—eat my Christmas dinner &amp; spent the evening at the
                Baptist minister's here, Mr Lung, a grand wife, &amp; a big family all home to dinner
                seven children two grown—had a good time—haven't been out any where else particular for a
                month—in fact the storms &amp; snow &amp; bad walking keep me
                weatherbound—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  two more letters from Herbert—he has sent you by mail two big books,
                the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Life of Blake</span>, he sent them to me to take to
                you—they are quite valuable &amp; curious books—I <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00492_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00492_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00492_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>think the first
                time George or Van or Mont comes up they had better stop here &amp; get
                them—Herbert also sent me a P.O. order for a small sum, asking me to get
                something for your children for Christmas—I have not yet cashed it at the P.O.—Mrs G appears to be about well again—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is now
                12½ Sunday—it is moderated, &amp; the sun has come out—my sister
                has just come home from church—All goes on about as usual here—New
                Year's day was rather flat, all around, so bleak &amp; cold &amp; deep snow—Still the women are out in their finery, plenty of them—I believe some would
                parade out in their new bonnets &amp; pretties if it froze their noses off—George, dear friend, how are you getting along this winter?—did you get the new
                cider—&amp; is any of it left?—I suppose Mont and Van are stout &amp;
                jolly as ever—have you had any sleigh riding boys?—Susan I sent you a
                little book &amp; one to Kate—did they come?—I want to see you all but I
                don't know when I shall come down.</p>
