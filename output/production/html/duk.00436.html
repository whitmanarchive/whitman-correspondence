            complimentory letters over a sheet of
                foolscap

            welcome and treat them very kindly

            from him he said if i got out of money
            i must write to him but i aint out
            yet i have felt sometimes quite uneasy
            about him as he is liable to be affected
            with the sun and he had to go to florence
                to inspect the new york pipe)
