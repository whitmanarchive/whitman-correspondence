                    Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1869, and Edwin
                    Haviland Miller dated it to 1870 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    2:368). Miller is correct. In the postscript, Louisa refers to Walt's "teedious
                    thumb," and in five letters between June and August 1870 Louisa inquired about
                    Walt's thumb. Therefore, this letter dates to June 29, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
                    staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
                    daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
                    time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
                    dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
                    often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
                    Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
                    1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
                    emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
