                    to become seriously ill from "lung fever" during his confinement at the
                    Confederate Military Prison at Danville. From December 3, 1864, to January 11,
                    1865, he was a patient in the prison hospital. Furthermore, on May 9, 1865, not
                    long after George and the other members of his regiment had been released in a
                    general exchange, Walt Whitman recorded in his journal that Lieutenant Colonel
                    John G. Wright, commanding officer of the Fifty-First Regiment, told him that
                    George "had got much weakened, &amp; was evidently failing; but to all inquiries
                    of his fellow officers, answered, 'O I feel well enough; there's nothing the
                    matter with me of any account.' Col. Wright said that at length one day he found
                    that George acted very strangely—he was seriously ill, &amp; was
                    delirious. He had thin &amp; wretched clothing, although it was in the midst of
                    winter" (Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00364_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Loving tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00364_n6"><span>See George's letter to
