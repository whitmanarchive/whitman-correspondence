            <p class="tei_p">I wrote you a line from Libby Prison a few days after I was taken prisoner, but think it doubtfull if you received it. I was taken, (along with almost our entire Regt. both Officers and men) on the 30th day of September, near the Weldon Rail Road, but am proud to think that we stood and fought untill we were entirely surrounded,  Major Wright, Lieuts Pooley, Sims, and 9 other Officers of our Regt, are here,  Capt Walton and Lieut Butler was wounded, but I dont know how badly,  I am very well indeed, and in tip top spirits, am tough as a mule, and about as ugly, and can eat any amount of corn bread, so you see, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">dear Mother</span> that I am all right, and my greatest trouble is that you will worry about me, but I beg of you not to frett, as I get along first rate. Please write to Lieut. Babcock Co. F of our Regt. and tell him to send my things home by Express. Much love to all.  G. W. Whitman</p>
