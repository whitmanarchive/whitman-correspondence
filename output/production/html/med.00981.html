            <p class="tei_p">Vibrations of hot breath and cold breath come to us
                from the land of the Buckeyes—the positive election news from whence is looked for
                here, with great interest. If Ohio has newly chosen the whig<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">1</a> ticket, as a dispatch
                in one of the morning papers intimates, it will make the contest close. The
                impression here, at present, is, however, that the democratic Governor is elected
                in Ohio. But you will know the result, by telegraph, before this reaches you....We
                are now, as you may imagine, in the true whirl of excitement. "Old Hunkers" and
                "Barnburners,"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> and Taylorites<a href="#n10b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10b">3</a> of a 
                warmer or cooler complexion, "mingle, mingle,
                mingle," in crowds, public and private, and hold hot arguments in Wall street, and
                on the steamboats, and even amid the deafening roar of the omnibusses. Old Tammany
                has a monster flag, with that Grecian temple, and the names of the regular
                democratic nominees. Great fun, though, is poked by the wags, at the petty larceny
                conduct of the female figure who appears to be either running away or hiding behind
                the centre post of the aforesaid temple. Last night, the great flag fell down, and
                trailed in the dust of Nassau street.</p>

                and the previous day....Have you, amid the "Free Soil"<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a> excitement, noticed what wide
                and steady progress has been made by the doctrines of what are called the "National
                Reformers"? (that ambiguous and unmeaning name, which they ought to change for
                something more descriptive and distinctive.) Depend upon it, these people are
                already fitted by numbers and power, to exercise a potent influence on the elections
                of this country. Well, there is much good in some of their nations<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">6</a>—particularly that

                soon have a complete line of telegraph from this city to Halifax, N.S., via Boston

                <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible, tei_gap_reason_folded">[illegible]</span> between this
                city and Philadelphia. For some time past, they have sent an early train—at 6
                o'clock a.m.—fare three dollars; so that a person can go and stay several hours in
                Philadelphia, and then return at night....Our railroad, hence to Albany, is, about
                one-fourth of it, completely graded and ready for the superstructure of rails, etc.
                It looks somewhat ticklish, running close along the river, and often touching it,
                with the great mountains and rocks penning it in to the east....Lots of the innocent
                ones, in town, are victimized by sharpers, about now. Even the stale tricks of
                pocket-book dropping, watch stuffing, and so on, go down yet. Omnibus thieving, too,
                is rife....The crowd at the Castle Garden Fair is so great, that sometimes, of an
                evening, people can't get in. Where does all the money go?....Dr. Morrill,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">7</a> the
                balloon man, who started last Wednesday afternoon from Broadway, on an upward trip,
                came down ku-slosh in the waters of the Atlantic ocean, half a dozen miles from the
                light ship, somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock at night. After ducking and bobbing up
                and around, for some time, the high-flyer was taken off by a pilot boat, but for
                whose presence near by, the Doctor would certainly have gone to kingdom come. He
                saved not only himself, but his baloon, and come into town Friday morning....There
                is a great war going on here among the hatters—who get some hard

                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00950_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00950_n1"><span>Barnburners and Hunkers were terms used to describe 
                    opposing sides of the fracturing Democratic party in New York during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
                    reflected the national divisions that would lead to the American Civil War (1861–1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n10b">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n10b tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n10b"><span>The term
                    "Taylorites" refers to the political supporters of Zachary Taylor
                    (1784–1850). A Southern slaveholder and a well-known American miltary 
                    leader in the Mexican-American War, Taylor was the successful Whig Candidate 
                    for president in 1848, becoming the twelfth president of the
                    United States from 1849 until his death in 1850. </span></span> [<a href="#r10b">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n11 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n11"><span>Martin Van Buren (1782–1862) was the eighth president of the United
                States, serving from 1837 to 1841. Whig candidate William Henry Harrison
                defeated the incumbent Van Buren in the 1840 election to become the ninth
                president of the United States. Van Buren later became an anti-slavery leader and 
                was the Free Soil candidate for president in the 1848 election; the Whig Candidate Zachary Taylor
                (1784–1850) defeated Van Buren and went on to serve as the twelfth president of the United States. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00954_n6 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00954_n6"><span>Formed during the 1848 election, the Free Soil 
                    Party opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories of the western United States,
                 which included the territory that Mexico had ceded to the United States
                 in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War. When neither the 
                 Democratic nor the Republican party presidential nominees would rule out the expansion of slavery
                 into these territories, the Free Soil Party was formed in response. The Free Soil
                Party was active for six years, from 1848 to 1854. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00981_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00981_n1"><span>Whitman almost certainly meant "notions." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00980_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00980_n4"><span>Dr. Morrill was an aeronaut
