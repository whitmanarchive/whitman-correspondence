            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came this morning, &amp; not until we got it could we believe in the
                change—so different from what we supposed the programme was arranged to be, in <span class="tei_name">St Louis</span>, housekeeping &amp;c. 
                Dear Hattie, it is real lonesome here since you went away—it is more a "receiving vault" to me than ever.
                Thank God though I am certainly better this winter, &amp; more like a prospect for me
                physically, than for now nearly four years. (It will be now four years the 23<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span> of January, since I was paralyzed)
                This makes me more cheerful &amp; buoyant under the chilling atmosphere, (both moral &amp;
                meteorological) of this house. Dear girls, I sometimes lately feel as if I was going
                out in the world, to take some hand again in some work that suits me, even if ever
                so little. Wouldn't it be a blessed thing?—You see dear girls I just talk
                freely &amp; confidentially to you both—I want some one 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fmhs.00009.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fmhs.00009.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fmhs.00009.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                to talk to—&amp; it does me good—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Hattie, I have just got your pictures (after some delay) from the photographic
                    printers. I will send you one 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">soon</span>—&amp; will send your father one, &amp; your
                Aunt Hannah at Burlington wants one. Your Aunt Lou has one in the parlor already,
                &amp; it looks very nice—it is a plain head only, looks like an engraving, no
                fixings or bows or jewelry, but a simple fine classical head, just as I wanted
                it—But you will see when I send it you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your Uncle George, Aunt Lou &amp; Cousin Eddy are all well as usual. 
                Tip is also well as usual—It has been &amp; is very
                cold here—the ground is all covered with snow—but it is bright to-day. I
                have just been out about three blocks off in an alley, to see a poor young man James
                    Davis, who is dying of consumption—You know I
                like to visit the sick—I have to stay in most of the time just now though, as
                it is very slippery—Little Helen Ewing is staying here now—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If I keep as well as now I think of going on to New York on a visit next month. Lou
                will write to you soon.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute"> Love to you dear, dear Hattie, &amp; Love to you, dear dear Jessie, from</span>
