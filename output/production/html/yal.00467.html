            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for your kind thought of me. I value the photograph
            much, and I wish that I could see not only this sun-picture, excellent as I
            am told it is, but also the living original. May he still live and flourish for
            many years to be. The coming year should give new life to every American
            who has breathed a breath of that soul which inspired the great founders
            of the American Constitution, whose work you are to celebrate. Truly, the
            mother country, pondering on this, may feel that how much soever the 
            daughter owes to her, she, the mother, has, nevertheless, something to
            learn from the daughter. Especially I would note the care taken to guard a 
            noble constitution from rash and unwise innovators.</p>
                     <p class="tei_p">I am always yours,</p>
