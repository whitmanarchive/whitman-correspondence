                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for your kind thought of me.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I value the photograph
            much, and I wish that I could see not only this sun-picture, excellent as I
            am told it is, but also the living original. May he still live and flourish for
            many years to be. The coming year should give new life to every American
            who has breathed a breath of that soul which inspired the great founders
            of the American Constitution, whose work you are to celebrate. Truly, the
            mother country, pondering on this, may feel that how much soever the 
            daughter owes to her, she, the mother, has, nevertheless, something to
            learn from the daughter. Especially I would note the care taken to guard a 
            noble constitution from rash and unwise innovators.</p>

                    William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
                    friendship described in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Memoriam</span>, which Tennyson wrote
                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson, 
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> [New York: F. P.
                    Harper, 1896], 223). Tennyson's first letter to Whitman is dated <a href="med.00410">July
                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
                    to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_yal.00467_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="yal.00467_n1"><span>Walt Whitman sent
                    Tennyson one of the photographs taken by George Collins "G. C." Cox (1851–1903), who was
                    a well-known celebrity photographer. Cox had taken photographs of Whitman 
                    when the poet was in New York to give his Lincoln lecture in 1887. The text of this letter was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span> on November 22, apparently before Walt
                    Whitman received it. See the <a href="loc.07360">November 23, 1887</a>, letter to Whitman
