            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The spirit moves me to scribble off a few lines to you—but I don't know why,
                for I have no news to tell &amp; nothing particular to write about any how. I
                returned to-day from a three days visit to my Quaker friends at
                Germantown—they have tip top horses &amp; carriage, &amp; we had good long
                drives Saturday afternoon &amp; Sunday towards evening after the rain—After
                supper, &amp; the things are removed, we all sit around the table we sometimes keep
                it up an hour &amp; a half &amp; have a good talk &amp; discussions, &amp; accounts
                of any thing that has occurred during the day, &amp; somebody has questions to put
                or information to glean,—perhaps some little recitation or singing, a good lot
                of us—eight or nine altogether—there are two just grown daughters, as
                nice and jolly and 'cute as young women can be—one son—&amp; always
                three or four others—making a good time <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00210_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00210_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00210_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00210_large.jpg</span> Sunday morning, they have family
                prayers—I was requested to read a chapter from the testament—(the Sermon
                on the Mount)—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">which I did</span>—(I wish you could
                have all seen &amp; heard me)—I never beheld such a merry, affectionate,

            <p class="tei_p">—With me, this fall, everything just floats idly along, as far as writing and work are
                concerned—Down there at Ocean Grove and along Barnegat &amp;c. I was moved to
                write a poem <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">on the ocean</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I have turned it &amp; turned it &amp; rewritten it over &amp; over
                again—but cant get it to suit me yet—Harry, how is it with you? &amp;
                why didnt you come &amp; tell me—before you left the printing offices
                here?—Write me a line soon as you get this<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—Sometimes I think you must be sick—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I am about as usual—I am writing this after 9 at night up in my room, sitting
                in the big ratan chair.</p>
