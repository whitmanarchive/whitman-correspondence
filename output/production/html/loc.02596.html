                    was an English-born travel and guidebook writer. King and his family immigrated
                    to the United States when he was five years old. In 1881, he graduated from
                    Harvard University and married Bertha Cloyes. The Moses King Corporation
                    produced photobooks on various subjects, and King wrote guidebooks for major
                    cities including Boston (1878), New York City (1893), and Philadelphia (1902).
                    In 1891, King edited <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">King's Handbook of the United States</span>
                    (Buffalo, NY: Moses King Corporation), a nearly one-thousand-page book with text
                    by Moses Forster Sweetser and over two-thousand illustrations. Whitman is
                    briefly mentioned: "Long Island includes three counties, with 800,000
                    inhabitants, and is 140 miles long, having (according to Walt Whitman) the form
                    of a fish" (588). For more information, see King's obituary, "Moses King is
                    Dead" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, [June 13, 1909],
