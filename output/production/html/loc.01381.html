                has given the popularly elected body almost unlimited power. They can do practically what they choose—&amp;
                it is here that the various forms of Socialism will be practically thrashed out—for the world to see.

                    Smith (1867–1951) was born in Philadelphia and became a Quaker relief
                    organizer. She attended Bryn Mawr College and was a graduate of the class of
                    1890. She and her family lived in Britain for two years during her childhood and
                    again beginning in 1888. She married the philosopher Bertrand Russell in 1894;
                    the couple later separated, and they divorced in 1921. Smith also served as the
                    chair of a society committee that set up the "Mothers and Babies Welcome" (the
                    St Pancras School for Mothers) in London in 1907; this health center, dedicated
                    to reducing the infant mortality rate, provided a range of medical and
                    educational services for women. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall and
                    Hannah Whitall Smith, and she was the sister of Mary Whitall Smith
                    (1864–1945), the political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." </span></span> [<a href="#r7014">back</a>]</li><li id="n3137">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3137 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3137"><span>Rachel Pearsall Conn Costelloe
