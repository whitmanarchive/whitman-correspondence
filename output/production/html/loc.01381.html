            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">
                I am afraid it has been a long time since I sent thee a letter, although I have
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wanted</span> to write every day.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                We have been, since the New Year, in the midst of the most interesting of all our political
                fights, which is the more interesting from the fact that it was successful. The London
                Council, of which Frank  is a member, is practically a<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01381.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                Parliament for the most important city in the world. London has never had municipal government,
                though with its 5,000,000 people it is almost a State in itself—but now the new County Councils Act
                has given the popularly elected body almost unlimited power. They can do practically what they choose—&amp;
                it is here that the various forms of Socialism will be practically thrashed out—for the world to see.
                The men who are elected are in a great majority strong reformers &amp;<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01381.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                Liberal—"progressists" is the new word for them—&amp; we all expect the tendency of their policy
                to be distinctly Socialistic. There is one noted socialist, John Burns, among them, but next to him I suppose
                Frank is the most "advanced"—Last night the chief of the "Fabians"—the most important Socialistic body—descended
                upon us to induce Frank to become the spokesman of their party, &amp; it is quite likely that he may ultimately
                find himself in that position—though he<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01381.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                does not actually call himself Socialist.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">We are greatly delighted over his return, for it seems, for the moment, an opportunity for even greater immediate
                usefulness than a seat in Parliament under a Tory Government would be. But then Frank is an incurable Optimist
                &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">always</span> sees that things are "for the best."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The work that this involves is of course immense, &amp; I hardly see how he can manage it along with <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">is​ </span><span class="tei_corr">his​

            <p class="tei_p">Two women have been elected—but by a curious &amp; very English-y mandate, it is quite uncertain whether they are really qualified to serve or not.
                A petition has been filed against Lady Sandhurst —one of the women—which will decide the matter before
                the Queen's Bench. Frank hopes to expend some of his<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01381.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01381.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, Father &amp; Alys have been away from all this turmoil. We all spent our Christmas holiday in Normandy together, &amp;
                when we came home they went to Paris &amp; then on down to the Riviera, &amp; are now in Mentone enjoying the blue sky
                &amp; warm air &amp; the lovely, lovely scenery. Their pleasure is heightened by the reflection that the fog in London

                in the day—When I ask her "What did papa do?", she invariably answers "Papa bizz" (busy)—And it is not far from the truth—This
