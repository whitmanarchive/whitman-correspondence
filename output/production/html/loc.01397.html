                must be with you by this time &amp; perhaps Logan too—I
             send best love to both—Logan's letter rec'd &amp; gladly—With me slowly jogging along
                (down hill)—easier the last few days of my third attack of grip, &amp; get
                out either by horse &amp; hansom or wheel chair almost every day—love to
                get down by the Delaware &amp; sit watching half an hour or more—was there
                last evening at sunset—Suppose you rec'd the papers, accting my birth day
                supper (I am now in my 72d y'r you know)—Dr Bucke is
                home in Canada at his Asylum busy as a bee—is well—I have heard of my
                lines &amp; note ab't the Queen's birthday in the English papers—my last
                poem was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rejected</span> by the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Century</span>—&amp; I now feel pretty well out in

                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nineteenth Century</span>—but I am well used to it all—have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">massage</span> every
                day, &amp; get along fairly—some very hot weather here—the country
                seems prosperous—good crops, great census—What I am afraid mostly
                ab't America is that we are too prosperous &amp; too infernally <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">smart</span>—
