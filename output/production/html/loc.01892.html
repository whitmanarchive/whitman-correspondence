                    Armory Square Hospital in 1865 and returned to his family at Cedar Lake, New
                    York, accompanied by another injured soldier named Wood (probably Calvin B.
                    Wood; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</span>, ed.
                    Edward F. Grier [New York: New York University Press, 1961–1984], 6:673).
                    For other correspondence between Ryder and Walt Whitman, see Ryder's <a href="loc.00607">August 9, 1865</a>, letter to Whitman. Excerpts from
                    five of Whitman's letters to an unidentified ex-soldier (later identified as
                    Anson Ryder, Jr.) were printed by Florence Hardiman Miller in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Overland Monthly</span> under the title "Some Unpublished
                    Letters of Walt Whitman's. Written to a Soldier Boy" in 1904. She was not able
                    to date most of the letters or to offer any initial conjectures about the identity of the recipient. 
                    However, Edwin Haviland Miller later identified the soldier as Ryder. Florence
                    Miller seems to imply that the correspondence continued into the early
                    1870s. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01892_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01892_n1"><span>This letter is addressed: Mr
