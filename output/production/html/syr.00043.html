            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 21<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> just to hand with
                card from Mrs O'Connor. The latter is gloomy, indeed we must
                not expect much good news from that quarter, I had a note from O'C'<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">s</span> D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>, D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Hood, which I enclose, it shows a bad state of things. O'C. may go on a long time but that
                is hardly to be expected or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">desired</span>—we much make up
                our minds to his death or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">worse</span>—for should he live
                much longer his life would necessarily become a burden to himself and others. I do
                not like to write this way but I think you ought to know my candid opinion. The case
                was bad enough before the development of the epeleptoid attacks [/] now it is simply
                desperate. That is as far as we can see—beyond and outside of that is another
                story and I have no doubt (as you have so well taught) that all is well provided for
                and is as it should be. We must have faith and keep cool whatever comes or goes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The weather here today is perfect, like Mary—warm, bright, lovely, and I am
                enjoying it. Yes, I have enough to do it that is a good thing (suppose it is) but I
                often wish (we are never content you see) for a little more freedom and
                leisure—but if I had them I guess I should not be a bit more satisfied.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall be glad (very glad) to get a few copies of that McKay
                picture—I hope thay will make a good job of it. The 1864 picture you gave me
                the other day is setting up on the bookshelf at my right hand looking at me in the
                most friendly way</p>
