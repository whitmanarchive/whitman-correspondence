                I wrote to Grandma yesterday evening Mama's death was very 
                unexpected here the day was so pleasant that she asked Papa to take her out 
                riding and Papa said he would so he brought up the buggy and lifted Mama in he then went to take the 
                reins and just then Mama said. Now wait till I get my dress fixed and Papa waited
