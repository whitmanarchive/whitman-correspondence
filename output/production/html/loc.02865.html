                    correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
                    together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Mattie) in 1873 and
                    his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
