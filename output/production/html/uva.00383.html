            <p class="tei_p">I have gone over the chapters—got quite in the spirit of them—added &amp; suggested a few lines or words here &amp; there—and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pruned</span> a few passages, even pages, remorselessly. I like them all—they are very <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">living</span>—the "Beauty" chapter I think especially fine.</p>
       
            <p class="tei_p">Do you say the final chapter is already in print? the one about me? If so, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">send me the proof</span>, which I will return by next mail. I am feeling quite well for me.</p>
