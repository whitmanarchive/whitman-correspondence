            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">worry</span> of Ruskin—he has at various times sent to me
                for six sets of my ($10, two <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">Vol.</span>​ ) centennial Edition—&amp; sent the money
                for them—with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> is that they are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">too personal</span>, too emotional, launched from the fires of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">myself</span>, my spinal passions, joys, yearnings, doubts,
                appetites &amp;c &amp;c.—which is really what the book is mainly for, (as a
                type however for those passions, joys, workings &amp;c <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in all the
                    race</span>, at least as shown under modern &amp; especially American
                auspices)—Then I think he winces at what seems to him the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic</span> brag of L. of G.—I have heard from R several times
                through English visitor friends of his—It is quite certain that he has
                intended writing to me at length—&amp; has doubtless made draughts of such
                writing—but defers &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fears</span>—&amp; has not yet
                written—R like a true Englishman evidently believes in the high poetic art of
                (only) making abstract works, poems, of some fine plot or subject, stirring,
                beautiful, very noble, completed within their own centre &amp; radius, &amp; nothing
                to do with the poet's special personality, nor exhibiting the least trace of
                it—like Shakspere's great unsurpassable dramas. But I have dashed at <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the
                    greater drama going on within myself &amp; every human being—that is what
                    I have been after</span>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">P.S. William, (as you seem to be <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="destined​ ">destin'd</span>​  to defend the banner) I say here once for all you have my permission to
                make any extracts, at any time, should you so like from any of my letters—</p>
