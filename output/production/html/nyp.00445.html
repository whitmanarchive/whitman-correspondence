            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">worry</span> of Ruskin<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—he has at various times sent to me
                for six sets of my ($10, two <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="volume​ ">Vol.</span>​ ) centennial Edition<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—&amp; sent the money
                for them—with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> is that they are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">too personal</span>, too emotional, launched from the fires of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">myself</span>, my spinal passions, joys, yearnings, doubts,
                appetites &amp;c &amp;c.—which is really what the book is mainly for, (as a
                type however for those passions, joys, workings &amp;c <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in all the
                    race</span>, at least as shown under modern &amp; especially American
                auspices)—Then I think he winces at what seems to him the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic</span> brag of L. of G.—I have heard from R several times
                through English visitor friends of his—It is quite certain that he has
                intended writing to me at length—&amp; has doubtless made draughts of such
                writing—but defers &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fears</span>—&amp; has not yet
                written—R like a true Englishman evidently believes in the high poetic art of
                (only) making abstract works, poems, of some fine plot or subject, stirring,
                beautiful, very noble, completed within their own centre &amp; radius, &amp; nothing
                to do with the poet's special personality, nor exhibiting the least trace of
                it—like Shakspere's great unsurpassable dramas. But I have dashed at <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the
                    greater drama going on within myself &amp; every human being—that is what
                    I have been after</span><a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—</p>

                        17, 1883</a>: "I was very much touched with what Ruskin wrote, which
                    seemed to me to be very strongly on your side. . . . It seems a great thing to
                    say, as Ruskin does, that your book 'is deadly true—in the sense of
                    rifles—against our deadliest social sins'—and also that its fruit is
                    'ungatherable save by loving and gleaning hands, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">and by the
                        blessed ones of the poor</span>.' I understand this as a high
