                    Mrs Gilchrist | Keats' Corner 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London England. It is
                    postmarked: Camden | (?) | 14 | 7 AM | N.J. The note was written at the bottom
                    of a post card announcement of the Philadelphia printings of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>. Since John
                    Burroughs had just returned from England (see the letter from Whitman to
                    Burroughs of <a href="med.00691">August 13, 1882</a>), and since the
                    postmark is clearly "14 | AM," the card was undoubtedly written on August
                    13. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00054_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00054_n1"><span>Probably a reference to
