                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For

                    (1845–1911) graduated from Bellevue Medical College in New York in 1870
                    and moved to Burlington, Vermont, in 1874. After the death of Dr. Samuel W.
                    Thayer in 1882, Bingham became Hannah's doctor. According to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Vermont Medical Monthly</span>, "From about 1878, for a period
                    of 20 years, he was one of the most active and the best known surgeons in
                    Vermont" (Volume 17, Issue 12 [December 15, 1911]), 306. For more information,

                    "sent $50 to Dr Bingham, Burlington, 40 for Hannah" (Whitman's Commonplace
                    Book [Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.]). Bingham, who had been
                    Hannah's physician for many years, noted receipt of the money on <a href="loc.08045">July 19(?)</a>, and told the poet to discount Heyde's
                    unreliable reports about Hannah's condition. On <a href="loc.08046">August
                        6, 1891</a>, Bingham wrote that Hannah's health was better, but "Mr Heyde
                    is evidently drinking heavily and no reliance whatever to be placed upon
                    him." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
