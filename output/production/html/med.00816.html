                    on June 29, 1872, reported that Walt Whitman "was cordially met by the venerable
                    gentlemen sitting upon the platform. He then took his position at the desk and
                    read, with clearness of enunciation, his poem, written for the occasion, 'As a
                    Strong Bird on Pinions Free.' As Mr. Whitman himself said to the writer, 'There
                    is no one expression that could stand as the subject of the poem.'" For another
                    first-hand report of this recitation, see Perry, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
