                    was on the staff of the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>. Apparently he met
                    Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
                    in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
                    in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
                    the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    pension plan in his letter from <a href="loc.06008">December 6</a>, at the
                    conclusion of which Whitman wrote: "Answer'd &amp; sent on at once peremptorily
                    declining, &amp; forbidding the pension application W W." William Sloane Kennedy
                    had mentioned the possibility of a pension to Whitman as early as <a href="loc.05855">January 7, 1885</a>: "If this humbug government were
                    worth a copper spangle it wd have settled a handsome pension on you, an honorary
                    life salary—as a recognition of your unparalleled services during the war.
                    But it wd probably be odious to you to even have the subject whispered of?" In
                    his letter Baxter also referred to a "Whitman Society" that he was forming with
                    John Boyle O'Reilly, Truman Howe Bartlett, and Mrs. Charles Fairchild, and to
