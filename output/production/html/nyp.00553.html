            <p class="tei_p">Your kind letter of Dec. 6, rec'd—&amp; much welcomed—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I thank you deeply &amp; Mr Lovering also—but do not consent to being an
                applicant for a pension, as spoken of—I do not deserve it—Send word to
                Mr Lovering, or show him this—I thank him deeply—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am living here in my shanty, in good spirits, but sadly disabled
                physically—(have a hard job to get from one room to the next)—Am
                occupied in getting ready the copy of a little book—my last—to be called
                "November Boughs"—the pieces in prose and verse I have thrown out the last
                four years—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Best love to you &amp; to all my Boston friends—</p>
