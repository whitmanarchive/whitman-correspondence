            <p class="tei_p">Sunny &amp; cool to-day—nothing new in my case—bowel action—my lines on Sheridan's
                burial were printed in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> Aug: 12—(I am beginning to keep my bits &amp;
                contributions, poetic spurts &amp;c. again already—tying in a budget in stiff
                covers)—I enclose you page 118—having now sent, if I think right, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> the proof
                pages of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: Boughs</span> complete from 5 to 140—We wish to have real good paper &amp; press

                successful a handsome plain, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pocketable</span> booklet—want it to be retail 1.25 or better
                still $1—who or when the publishers &amp; bro't out still undecided—not before than
                October anyhow—I still have the design of making a 900 page Vol. my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">complete works</span>,
                the paper &amp; printing uniform &amp; a few typos corrected—Will see how the cat jumps—I
