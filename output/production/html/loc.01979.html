            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Please pardon my intrusion but as I am a great lover of literature especially poetry,
                I have always taken great interest in you and your poems and other writings and am a
                great admirer of them,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have often looked for your photograph but have never succeeded in obtaining one and
                have no definite idea of your features. I have been much disappointed in not
                securing your photograph and concluded that, perhaps, I could procure one of you 
                Have you a photograph of yourself which you could send me?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose you 25¢ for photograph if you have one which you are willing to send to me.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall anxiously await your reply and hope that you will be so kind as to send a
                photograph I have long desired your opinion on several matters in literature but
                will only ask you one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have read and studied Mr. Joaquin Miller's<a href="#n0412" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0412">1</a> poems "<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Songe​ </span></span> of the Sierras" 
                and have been greatly impressed by them.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a> I am very curious
                to learn your opinion of him, and his poems. I shall be greatly indebted to you if
                you will give me an opinion of Mr. Miller's muse
                If you will be so kind as to answer my critical questions I will thank you very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you if you are not occupied please write me with your own hand a copy of one of
                your poems? I do not wish to be a nuisance and a bore to you and if you have not plenty of
                leisure

                and with yours if you send it I will complete the series of the 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">greatest</span> American poets. If you do not wish to answer I
                will not be greatly surprised for I presume you are nearly bored to death by
                "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">autograph fiends</span>" but I write you as a lover of literature and am not to be
                classed with the "fiends" in any sense.</p>

                    Cincinnatus Heine Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of
                    the Rockies" and "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness
                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
                    poetry; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), 60.
                    Whitman met Miller for the first time in 1872; he wrote of a visit with Miller
                    in a <a href="prc.00026">July 19, 1872</a>, letter to his former publisher and
                    fellow clerk Charles W.

                    poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
                    manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
                    not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
                    Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
