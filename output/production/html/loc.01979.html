                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr Whitman</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Please pardon my intrusion but as I am a great lover of literature especially poetry,
                I have always taken great interest in you and your poems and other writings and am a
                great admirer of them,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have often looked for your photograph but have never succeeded in obtaining one and
                have no definite idea of your features. I have been much disappointed in not
                securing your photograph and concluded that, perhaps, I could procure one of you 
                Have you a photograph of yourself which you could send me?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose you 25¢ for photograph if you have one which you are willing to send to me.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01979.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01979.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01979.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall anxiously await your reply and hope that you will be so kind as to send a
                photograph I have long desired your opinion on several matters in literature but
                will only ask you one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have read and studied Mr. Joaquin Miller's poems "<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Songe​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Songs​
        
      </span></span> of the Sierras" 
                and have been greatly impressed by them. I am very curious
                to learn your opinion of him, and his poems. I shall be greatly indebted to you if
                you will give me an opinion of Mr. Miller's muse
                If you will be so kind as to answer my critical questions I will thank you very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you if you are not occupied please write me with your own hand a copy of one of
                your poems? I do not wish to be a nuisance and a bore to you and if you have not plenty of
                leisure 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01979.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01979.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01979.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                I will not ask you for the poem I have poems in the handwriting of Bryant, 
                Longfellow, Holmes and Whittier 
                and with yours if you send it I will complete the series of the 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">greatest</span> American poets. If you do not wish to answer I
                will not be greatly surprised for I presume you are nearly bored to death by
                "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">autograph fiends</span>" but I write you as a lover of literature and am not to be
                classed with the "fiends" in any sense.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With best wishes for your health and prosperity</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">I am always your friend and admirer</span>
