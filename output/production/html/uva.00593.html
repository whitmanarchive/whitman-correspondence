            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed card has just come from Rolleston—Delgany,
                County Wicklow, Ireland, I address him—I have had a hard time with sickness
                (another spell of war paralysis, the fifth or sixth time) all summer—the
                serious attack warded off again—but extreme weakness of legs and body
                remaining—Keeping me in my sick room so far—yet my usual mentality &amp;
                good heart continued—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My little new 140 page $1.25 booklet "November Boughs" is finishing the print work
                &amp; shall send you a copy soon as it is done. I am to have all my books printed
                &amp; bound in one large 900 page Vol. too, ("Walt Whitman Complete") soon
                ready—I am sitting in my room writing this, body almost paralyzed—</p>
