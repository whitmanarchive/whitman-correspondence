                    well—Warry has his—he is well. Is it
                practicable to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">fac-similize</span> your plate (of course at our
                expense here) of my picture (in 1890) to send here for my forthcoming little (2d)
                annex? We all like it much, &amp; I sh'd like to have
                one to keep here to print from. Am well as usual &amp; send love &amp; thanks. Warry
