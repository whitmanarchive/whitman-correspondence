                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest

                    of Commons. Born in Australia to an Irish father and Scottish mother, Lynch was
                    educated at the University of Melbourne and worked as a civil engineer before
                    relocating to Galway, Ireland. During the Second Boer War, he raised an Irish
                    brigade that fought against the Crown; as a result, he was convicted of treason,
                    sentenced to death, and subsequently pardoned. Upon his release, Lynch attended
                    St. Mary's Hospital Medical School and became a general practitioner. Lynch
                    wrote prolifically in several genres, including fiction, poetry, and philosophy;
                    the "little book" alluded to in this letter may refer to Lynch's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Modern Authors: A Review and a Forecast</span> (London: Ward and
                    Downey, 1891). The book devotes much attention to Whitman, and Lynch writes that
                    Whitman "has the true poet's largeness of soul" but "lacks a little the singing
                    faculty, though the divine afflatus at his best carries him safely along" (41).

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
