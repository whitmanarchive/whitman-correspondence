                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Quite a beautiful day—clear &amp; frosty—very pleasant &amp; bracing after the wet 
            stormy weather we have had of late.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The last two evenings I have been paying long-deferred visits to friends—Fred Wild &amp; Sam 
                Hodgkinson—with a 
                brief call on Hutton on Thursday.—All well &amp; prospering fairly.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I was at Johnston's too one evening—Tuesday I think I called too 
                on Nightingale &amp; he is to come tomorrow morning (Sunday)
                to spend the day here.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been quite unsettled as to business arrangements since I came home.—The offers I have received have been unsatifactory 
                to me &amp; I have refused them. But I have practically decided on coming to terms on a basis which, though 
                far from satisfactory to me, may do provisionally.</p>
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01979_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01979_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01979_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is perhaps better so. For I know more clearly than I did the character of the men I have been dealing with, &amp; the 
                nature of my position. And I can act accordingly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been reading Carpenter's book "Towards Democracy," &amp; 
                like it much better than I expected. I feel impelled to write to him &amp; should like to know him better</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Lynch's book I have not read yet—beyond the first chapter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am clear of my cold again &amp; feel pretty well. And all the friends are well I think.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have scarcely realized that Christmas is so close upon us. It will be over when you get this. I ordered some 
                cards &amp; expected to get them in time 
                for the American Mail, but owing to some blunder I have not got them yet.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am anxious to receive some better account of your health &amp; condition than 
                that in your last postal.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Copies of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"Three Tales"</span> received. I quite like the get up of the little book &amp; am 
                very pleased to have it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Love to Mrs. Davis &amp; Warry &amp; to yourself supremely.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours affectionately</span>
