        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John Burroughs,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have had another severe spell the last five weeks—head troubles, &amp; stomach troubles, 
        &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">liver</span> troubles—the doctor thinks the latter the seat &amp; basis this time of all, or nearly all—head-swimming, faintness, vomiting, &amp;c—but for three or four days past have been easier—am up—didn't go out for three to four weeks, but am venturing out a little now—hope 
        &amp; quite expect to get at least as well as I was before this spell—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Eldridge has made me a call of two or three hours, (on his return from Boston to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash'n</span>​ )—Seems to be nothing very new among our friends at <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ "><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash'n</span>​ </span>​ —Marvin has written me twice—he has been reading your "Notes," 
        &amp; is quite possessed with them—also "Dem. Vistas"—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am writing very little—have a piece, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">melange</span>, 
        prose &amp; verse, in the "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Christmas Graphic</span>"—(comes out in a week or so,) in which I say a brief word about Emerson—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">To eke out my letter I send a scrap from paper about death of a young friend of mine—also another scrap—also another from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Academy</span>, (which latter only please return when you write)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Best love to 'Sula—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Merry Christmas</span>—do you get in the new house? 
        Write me a good long letter—I wish I was with you—</p>
