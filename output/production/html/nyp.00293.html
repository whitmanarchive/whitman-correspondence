        <span class="tei_salute">Dear John Burroughs,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have had another severe spell the last five weeks—head troubles, &amp; stomach troubles, 
        &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">liver</span> troubles—the doctor thinks the latter the seat &amp; basis this time of all, or nearly all—head-swimming, faintness, vomiting, &amp;c—but for three or four days past have been easier—am up—didn't go out for three to four weeks, but am venturing out a little now—hope 
        &amp; quite expect to get at least as well as I was before this spell—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Eldridge has made me a call of two or three hours, (on his return from Boston to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash'n</span>​ )—Seems to be nothing very new among our friends at <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ "><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash'n</span>​ </span>​ —Marvin<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> has written me twice—he has been reading your "Notes," 
        &amp; is quite possessed with them—also "Dem. Vistas"—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am writing very little—have a piece, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">melange</span>,

                    co-editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical</span> in 1866–1867; see Frank
                    Luther Mott, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A History of American Magazines</span> (Cambridge:
                    Harvard University Press, 1938–1968), 3:78n. Later he was employed in the
                    Treasury Department in Washington. On <a href="loc.03656">December 15,
                        1874</a>, Marvin wrote to Whitman: "I read and re-read your poems, and the
                    'Vistas,' and more and more see that I had but a faint comprehension of them
                    before. They surpass everything. All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my
                    attention. I read, Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows verses on Sumner, in the last
                    Atlantic, and then I read your poem on the Death of Lincoln. It was like
                    listening to a weak-voiced girl singing with piano accompanyment, and then to an
                    oratorio by the whole Handel Society, with accompanyment by the Music Hall
                    organ" (The Library of Congress). His veneration of Whitman is also transparent
                    in an article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical Review</span>, 1 (1877),
