            <p class="tei_p">While so much sympathy is exhausted on all kinds of
                suffering, upon land, it is often forgotten that there exists an unreaped field for
                the exercise of the philanthropic spirit, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">at sea</span>. At sea, there is still no
                republicanism; absolute power prevails. Leaving the yet mooted point whether
                official despotism is requisite to safety on shipboard, I think few will refuse to
                agree that cruelty and oppression are not; it is undeniable, however, that an
                immense amount of such cruelty continues to be exercised from officers to their
                crews. The proportion of good officers, manly, and well-liked by their men, to those
                who are always dictatorial and brutal is perhaps great, the latter being in a
                considerable minority. But this minority have it in their power to cause much
                suffering, and do cause it in a way the heart revolts at.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">When a case comes before
                our courts involving the relation between officers and their men, I have noticed
                that the court generally takes it for granted that the officers are right and the
                men wrong, unless plainly proved to the contrary. This probably arises from the
                conservatism which is in the very nature of law and lawyers. So poor Jack, opposed
                to wealth, cunning and rank, does not often get the best side of the argument, even
                when he deserves it.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday there came up in this city, before the U. S. District
                Court, a case where the crime charged is of so revolting a nature that public
                indignation could hardly be too severely visited upon the offender, if proved
                guilty. It involves a vessel which sailed lately from your port, (for Antwerp, but
                it seems has put in here,) and whose officers and men are doubtless known in New
                Orleans. Charles A. Bertrand, master of the ship Alhambra, and Henry Watson, mate,
                were arraigned for the murder of Albert Burgess, one of their crew. The first
                witness examined was Edward Murphy, who testified as follows:</p>

                        <p class="tei_p">Oppression and Cruelty at Sea</p>
                        <p class="tei_p">Was a seaman on board the Alhambra; she is an American ship; sailed
                on board the ship about three weeks since from New Orleans, bound to Antwerp; the deceased boarded 
                in the same house with witness in New Orleans; does not know the right name of the deceased;
                he was known in New Orleans by the name of Davy, and on the vessel by the name of Albert;
                and he died on the Saturday after the Tuesday we left New Orleans; at four o'clock on that 
                day he was brought aft to receive punishment, and all the sailors and passengers were called
                to witness it; witness said to the captain, "I beg your pardon, sir; ask the man," meaning 
                the deceased, "what he has to say; is he drunk, or what is the matter with him?"  Captain said, 
                "silence, sir;" another Dutch boy then came, crying, to intercede for him; the purport of what 
                he said was to let the man go; cannot say what it was the captain said, but he took no notice
                of the boy; the next man that came up was an Italian; he seemed, to witness, to come in a 
                blustering sort of way; the captain took notice of him, but I did not understand what he said; 
                the captain then went to the deceased, and said to him, "if I let you go will you do your work?" 
                the man made no reply; he was lashed at the time, by both wrists, to the rigging, and stood 
                pretty straight; the next thing the captain ordered him to be flogged, but I don't remember 
                the words; does not know to whom the orders were given; but the orders were followed by a 
                flogging by a second mate, with a fifteen thread rope, which appeared to be a little swollen 
                from wet; there was a rope brought up here yesterday, but it is not the same; the order was to
                give him a dozen; several blows were given to him, but witness did not count them; the 
                captain called out to give it to him harder; the mate did as he was ordered, and the man 
                cried out "good sailors help," or something like that; the rope was about two feet and a 
                half long; after the captain had given the second order, the mate took both ends in his hand, 
                and lashed him with the rope doubled; the captain asked the mate, "are you counting these blows?" 
                The second mate seemed confused and made no reply, but moved out and gave him a very heavy blow 
                across the loins; he flogged him all along across the loins; the man had only a light cotton 
                shirt on him; the unfortunate man never murmured a bit; after he was let down the captain went
                to him and said, "will you now go to your work?" the reply was, "yes, sir;' he was kept lashed 
                up for about half an hour afterwards; the captain sat on the rail; witness saw irons under the 
                captain and the mate, but did not see them put on; when he was cut down, he fell on his back and
                lay there with his mouth open, gasping; the mate got a piece of canvass and put it under his
                head; every time that witness passed him, for about three-quarters of an hour, he heard a 
                rattling or gurgling in his throat; after that witness saw two men, one at his head and the 
                other at feet, dragging him along; witness thought that that was not the right way to bring him, 
                and he went and got something under his back, and with the others brought him into the forecastle
                and laid him in his bunk; witness then looked at him, and remarked to the other men the deadly 
                glaze of his eyes and that those were the rattles in his throat; cannot say when he died, but 
                thinks it was between four and eight o'clock; one of the men came to witness about midnight and 
                said the man was dead; witness then went into where he was; took him out of his bunk and put him 
                in a chair, and we overhauled him; he was black-and-blue about the mouth, which was full of blood; 
                witness turned up his shirt and found that he was black-and-blue about the loins; the mate came 
                then and saw him, and in some time after some old canvass was procured and he was sewed up; he was
                then brought up and laid on deck, a little aft of the forecastle; at day-light we came up to inter 
                him; witness asked the mate would they not read prayers over him; the mate said to witness he
                might get a paper and read as much prayers as he liked; no prayers, however, were read; he was 
                then thrown over. He was about twenty-three years of age, a Scotchman by birth, from what witness
                could learn; he was in good health and was a very stout young man; does not know the cause of 
                coming in here, but witness was very glad to get in; thinks it was Providence that drove them in;
                it was about eight hours after his death that he was thrown overboard.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">No attempt was
                made to invalidate this testimony. The principal facts were corroborated, indeed, by
                the second mate, who was brought on for the defence. This being a preliminary
                arrangement, the judge committed both Bertrand and Watson for manslaughter, telling
                them that they might apply to him in the morning in relation to bailâ€”that from the
                captain he should require heavy bail, but with the mate he would deal more
                leniently.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">It is time Congress passed an explicit law to prohibit this disgusting
                practice of whipping naked men on board ship, at the pleasure of masters. One is
                tempted to inquire, when hearing repeatedly of these whippings, whether we are
                really in advance of the bambooing Turks, and knouting Russians, in many points. Of
                a truth we are not. Do you recollect that a short cruise of the U. S. brig Somers,
                (manned by young apprentices from the U. S. Naval School,) under command of Slidell
                Mackenzie, a few summers since, was signalized by the bestowal of some <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">twenty-five
                hundred lashes</span>on the bare skin of those "free born" American youths?</p>
