                &amp; wh. I duly received yesterday morning. My heart's best gratitude to you for
                it. It was indeed welcomed. Thank you also for the second letter of Dr B's wh, you kindly enclosed—We

                me in reply to that letter (which I sent on to him)? He says—"'Splendid
                fellow' indeed! Oh how it made me wince! How it cut me! I know better." That was of
                course a remark of your own when someone spoke of your "blameless life."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was pleased to note in your letter that you were then no worse as regards your
                health; &amp; we continue to hope to hear still better news of you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">This has been a miserably wet day here. Tonight I have had two good hours' work upon
