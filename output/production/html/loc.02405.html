            <p class="tei_p">I have recovered from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that laziness</span> I complained of in spring or early summer. Do you know ones home or dwelling may be so situated with reference to open road, path to the spring, fields, pasture land, <span class="unclear damage tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_damage tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ab">garden</span> ground &amp;c that the position of out buildings, fences &amp;c are not well indicated? such has been mine. But my doubts being settled a little I can find occupation, and that will cure my sickening laziness—indeed several new steps are clearly indicated in my farm operations.</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">My crop is fair—my renters did so well by high, warm land early planted—my own cotton started off in early summer <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">to​ </span><span class="tei_corr">too​

            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps I dont owe it to you, but to myself to explain—being so enthusiastic, why have I not before this <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">visited you</span>. Well I thought you were so sick it would be little satisfaction to you—then since the price of cotton went down so much 3 years ago and followed by two small crops of it then most all of a few hundred dollars owing to me is by a man who bought property largely in the flush times—I dont know when he can <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">conveniently</span> pay me (other creditors may be pressing)—I desire to see you sometime—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Of course I am only a farmer with no understanding of fine peoples' etiquette—I might be a sort of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">elephant</span> in your hands (but I believe you and I laying our heads together could do almost anything—I dont know much of anything—I guess I possess about <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">best</span> <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rested</span> brain in the world—I thought early that I would not endanger my sanity or health by any hard study (I dont <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg">win</span> I have ever <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">needed to know much</span>—yet I know you think I am solid and sound—I'd like to loafe with you in a country place or library or through a city's streets.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">"Dignified appearance"—I swear I have on most all occasions of my life striven to be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">un</span>-dignified. Somehow dignity (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">apparent</span>) has been associated in my mind with selfish, resentful, misanthropic, un Democratic, un–brotherly feeling. I swear I have always most wished to be thought just and kind—been willing to be thought (if possible) a good natured fool. for simple ways, for restoring belief in what man sometimes is.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I've thought lately these pieces would make a good, orderly arranged little book by itself. 1—Carol of Words (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">things</span> are the best teachers. 2.

            <p class="tei_p">I have a young, poor farmer (of 26) new acquaintance, 1¼ miles from me studying Edition 1871 after Burroughs' Notes and Eagle's flight—he seems to get along well (with my clear explanations)—how long will he be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a Baptist</span>?

            He questioned me. These lines puzzled me always and I answered so—but instantly then this doubt or suspicion (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in talking with two men</span>) (<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">he</span> said what means "A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother &amp;c &amp;c &amp;c 3 lines"</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I've got my old renter the Methodist (local) preacher on Two Rivulets. I told him I never expected to convert him so great the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">power of habit</span> in thinking but wanted to show him some of us are great and good. He doesn't wish to grant that a man possessing all virtues possible to the best Christian <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">could</span> be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good</span> if he lacked Christian belief and worship. Walt: the man is not at all a fool, but I think he makes not one person love him (except relationship)—what a curious cold-hearted unloving "reformer" he <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_vm">is</span>. He goes through life (they say and he admits) dropping unpaid debts behind him—says he must withhold something to live on and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not starve</span>. Some say he's dishonest—but I hope he'll do nearly right with me—certainly he treated me respectfully and kindly years ago when he seemed to expect nothing. He never has family worship but grace at <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg">table</span></p>
