                    (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
                    rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
                    although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
                    When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01837">August 13,
                        1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
                    letter from <a href="loc.01838">September 13, 1874</a>: a former Rebel
                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
                    war he had been "a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slaveholding</span> youthful 'patriarch.'"
                    He informed Whitman in the <a href="loc.01837">August 13, 1874</a>, letter
                    that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                    Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                    that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                    Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                    profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                    after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
                    mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes with the usual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lack</span> of
