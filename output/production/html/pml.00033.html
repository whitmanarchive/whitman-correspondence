            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing special to write about to-day. The new Attorney General Mr. Williams has been in once or twice—he is a tallish, western sort of man, wears a stove-pipe hat—is rather spare &amp; a little round shouldered—sallow complexion—long legged—seems quite plain in his talk—Ashton says he is a good man—we will see—He takes his seat about the 10th Jan.

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">½ past 10, forenoon</span>—Mama, your letter has just come—It is too bad to have such a puppy as Stanton annoying you—He is one of the Heyde sort, it always seemed to me—Mother, write to me how it turns out—whether they leave or not—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I see you have it very changeable there too—After the severest cold spell ever known here so early, 
                we are just now having it mild &amp; warm enough for spring—it rained here this morning, but is now bright &amp; pleasant—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Lou will be with you now—I should like first rate to just drop in on you all—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I continue to get letters &amp;c from abroad about my book—I believe I told you I got one the other day from Denmark, 
                from the editor of the principal magazine there. He is preparing a review &amp; partial translation of my writings—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, I hope you will have a pleasant holiday week, what's left of it—Don't let Stanton annoy you, the dirty scamp—Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; to George &amp; Lou &amp; all.
