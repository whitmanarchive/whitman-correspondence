                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Whitman,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received a few days since your last letter. It is very pleasant to me to find you liked my 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Shakspere​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Shakespeare​
        
      </span></span> book, but 
                much more to know that you are not indifferent to me, myself, &amp; do not think of me as a 
                stranger.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The report of your health makes us both hopeful &amp; anxious. I do not know whether your American 
                Summers are as health-bringing as our Summers, but I should suppose they have a decided 
                advantage over your winters in this respect (notwithstanding all John Burroughs 
                says of Winter Sunshine) for an invalid; so it is chiefly from the summer that we shall look 
                for an advance towards recovery</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01496.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">The newspaper statement of the attitude of the American public towards you is a surprise &amp; 
                a disappointment We had been misled by a correspondent of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Academy</span>, 
                which is a paper always friendly to you, into quite a different view of things—I am waiting 
                until next Saturday to see whether Rossetti has inserted this statement 
                in the Academy. If he has not, I will write to him &amp; try to get it printed there.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Two friends, Professor Atkinson of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Trinity College​ ">Trin. Coll.</span>​  
                Dublin, &amp; Stoker, who writes to you, have asked me to get copies of 
                your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Three</span> volumes, L of G, Two Rivulets &amp; Memoranda.
                But I do not doubt that half-a dozen of my friends will wish to have the 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01496.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                books, so I should be obliged if you would send a parcel containing six copies of Each book—the 
                Autograph 1876-Edition. Stoker wishes me to ask you to put, if you do not object, his 
                name (Abraham Stoker) &amp; your own in the copies for him—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">He has told you perhaps of a very lively debate we had at our "Fortnightly Club" on "The genius 
                of Walt Whitman" last Monday Evening Feb 14<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> A most savage, but 
                ill-planned, attack opened the discussion. I followed with a speech which consisted in 
                the main of apt selections from L. of G. &amp; Democratic Vistas, &amp; these were felt by my 
                hearers to be a very effective answer to the previous speaker's extravagant statements. Then, 
                to my surprise &amp; great satisfaction, followed speaker 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01496.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                after speaker on the Whitman side,—a barrister, a young clergyman, a man in business, 
                &amp; others, while the remaining speakers were three, one who placed you below Victor Hugo 
                on the ground of alleged deficiency of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">form</span> &amp; beauty in your poems, 
                one who announced that he had never read your books but was sure you could have written nothing 
                as good as Burns' "Cotter's Saturday Night", &amp; a third recently 
                introduced to L. of G. &amp; who confessed to having discovered some few great poems, but much 
                that baffled him, &amp; that should be challenged.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The result was on the whole highly satisfactory. It was the 2nd Evening occupied by you during 
                the present session.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">These little skirmishes, however, are only occasional incidents in the quiet progress which as 
                I said before I am 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01496.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01496.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                convinced your writings are making.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to hear of Burroughs. I still owe him a letter of thanks for his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Winter Sunshine.</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">I Enclose a draft for the Equivalent of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sixty dollars</span>. Please send the

                always be of great concern to me, &amp; write a line when it suits you, but at no other time.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">P.S. If you have any Magazine articles why not try <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Gentlemans Magazine</span>—if 
                    a poem, or—better—if prose <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Fortnightly Review</span>?</p>
                <p class="tei_p">But have a 2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nd</span> copy of the MS made to avoid the risk of its being lost—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I strongly incline to think Morley of the Fortnightly Review would be glad to hear from 
                    you, if you have anything suitable.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">It also occurs to me that some arrangement might be come to with <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Messieurs​ ">Messrs</span>​  
                    Chatto &amp; Windus to publish your Two Rivulets &amp;c., &amp; give you a royalty on copies
