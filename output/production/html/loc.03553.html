            </span>

            <p class="tei_p"> I am here in these mountains and all around me nature in all her <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">lovliness​ </span></span> stands forth. The far distant woods, the singing birds, the many different
                noted birds and the sparkling dew on the grass and shrubbery all tell to me the same
                tale A tale of peacefulness and isolation from the busy, busy, striving Cities To
                me every thing is as the picture of a dream—a pleasant dream—from which I shall
                soon awake—Time <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">flys​ </span></span> by me on winged wheels and the length of my stay is being brought to an
                end. </p>

                Mountain to whose heights I aspire to climb and on its top to place an American
                flag—Such has been the custom here so to do for many many years. I will follow in
                the footsteps of my parents as in their young days they did the very same thing. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Having been told so many times at my mothers knee of how she did these things when
                she was young. It will be poetry now to me to do so myself Poetry is in the Soul
                and from the Soul and it delights my Soul to do these things over again as my
                parents did them. I see many friends and many who were friends of my Father and
                Mother. It has been 12 years since last I was here and to many I am a "regular
                suprise

                party" Hearing them talk of long ago makes me feel as if I were a living monument on
                the road of Time. A Zeus with compelling arm pointing backwards making man and woman
                alike review the past. Or an ordinary "finger post" marked, so many miles to Then. I
                have walked a great deal since I arrived here and enjoyed them very much. The
                climate is beginning to affect me now as it does all new comers. It makes one very drowzy and sleepy but in that it is very beneficial as it rests one and makes
                them fat—It is a case of sleep and grow fat instead of laugh <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03553.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03553.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03553.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03553.004_large.jpg</span> and grow fat.
