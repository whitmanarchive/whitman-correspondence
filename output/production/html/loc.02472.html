                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    (1865–1936) was an English novelist, poet, and short-story writer. India,
                    the country of his birth, inspired his most remembered literary works, such as
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Jungle Book</span> (1894) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kim</span>
                    (1901). Kipling was just beginning his rise to international celebrity in the
                    early 1890s. He married Carolina Starr Balestier (1862–1939) in

                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
