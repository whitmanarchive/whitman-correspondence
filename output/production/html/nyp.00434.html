                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Harry</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I keep about the same in health—am &amp; have been very busy with the printing
                of my book, it goes on all right &amp; suits me—246 pages are up (&amp; mostly
                    electrotyped)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">That was a sudden and dreadful piece of news, the death of Beatrice Gilchrist—your mother's letter informing me was sent on here
                from Camden P O—Harry, please tell her I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  it, &amp; thank her for sending me word—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Harry, I do not know the Secretary of the Navy or Treasury either—do you still think of getting in one of the coast
                life-saving stations? I will write to any one you wish me to, for that
                purpose—fix on some particular person, who has the appointment, if you decide
                to try for it—I will do any thing I can for you—(By the by, tell Van I
                went twice to see a man in Camden, a boss plumber, three months ago—he said he
                could not take on any boy just then, but he probably would want one, &amp; would
                send me word)—I am having good times here—have a good room &amp;
                boarding house, the landlady is first rate &amp; kind
                [to] me, (as often happens I find my best friends among the women)—then I have
                a friend here, a man of leisure, who has a good horse &amp; phaeton, takes me out
                riding afternoons or fine evenings—So you see I am
                putting in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good</span> papers—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, dear boy, how does it go with you? I hope all right—I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter here—tell Mont if he feels disposed to write to me, (if
                he is in the store &amp; has a spare hour) I will answer it—if he does, I want
                him to tell me all the news—(I get the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Phil: Ledger</span>, a friend in the office there sends it to me)—Hot, hot as the devil here three days the past
                week—but I don't seem to melt yet—pleasant &amp; cool now—I shall
                stay here three weeks yet—if you write direct same address (care J R Osgood
                &amp; Co: 211 Tremont Street Boston)—Love to you, Harry boy, &amp; keep a good
                heart—you know the verse of the old song</p>
            <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_l">"A light heart &amp; thin pair of breeches</span>
                <span class="tei_l">Goes through the world my brave
                boys"</span></span>

            <p class="tei_p">Well the office has just sent me a fresh batch of proofs &amp; I must go to work
                &amp; tackle them—</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

                <p class="tei_p">
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Later</span>—half an hour—I was keeping this, all
                    enveloped &amp;c. to take to the box when yours dated Sept: <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="3rd​ ">3d</span>​  has just come—so I open it to add a line—yes, I got the
                    letter of over two weeks since (as above)—dear boy, I feel sorry about the
                    ailing—write me about it all, soon as you get this—I send the papers
                    you request, same mail with this—Harry boy, if
                    you want a little money write me &amp; I will supply you—(Son, why did you
                    send your letter to Camden?)</p>

                <span class="tei_closer tei_closer_rend_right"><span class="tei_signed">Always your old Walt</span>
                </span>
                
                    <p class="tei_p">hope you will get this before Sunday—</p>
