                <p class="tei_p">Your letter of the 15th with the 'Additional Note' was not long in following the
                    other,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> &amp; with it the 'Specimen Days' vol. is now
                    splendidly complete.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a> As the book stands now, there is a native unity about it, more
                    I think than when it was given together with the 'Democratic Vistas.' These later
                    parts of the original 'S. Days &amp; Collect' will follow naturally as the more
                    theoretic exposition of your life &amp; thought, prepared for effectively &amp; made
                    so of greater effect, it seems to me. With the D. Vistas completed<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a> in turn, my cup
                    will be overflowing indeed. It is something I think of enthusiastically that soon
                    they will both be in the hands of the gay fellows everywhere, whose energies will
                    presently be master of the spirit of the time. And what you have added to the book
                    is so exactly what was wanted to give it direct appeal to us here, &amp; bring it into touch.
                    Personally I cannot say how grateful I feel for these gifts you have made me the
                    almoner of. As for the 'Democratic Vistas,' I hope you will be able to let us have
                    some of the essays &amp; papers that have appeared in the Critic &amp; other
                    publications, to add to it. As you know, the copy we have now by us is hardly enough
                    to make a full volume. You shall be duly apprised of the publishing details, of both
                    vols. as time goes on. We propose an interval of four <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuva_ej.00132_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fuva_ej.00132_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuva_ej.00132_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">uva_ej.00132_large.jpg</span> to six or eight months between the
                    2 vols. so that there is plenty of time to settle about the 2nd. Already the news that
                    you have published additional matter to the 'Specimen Days in America' has excited
                    great interest among those who know you here.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I told you I was going to see Mrs. Costelloe<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">8</a> the other
                    evening. Count Stenbock<a href="#n3135" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3135">9</a> arrived here in a fast hansom in his
                    usual erratic way, &amp; whirled me off there about nine o'clock, &amp; we had 'a
                    good time' then till midnight, including the brewing of a wassail bowl 
                    (non-alcoholic) with comic result by Steinbock &amp; an American girl who was there.
                    Mrs. Costelloe impressed me most delightfully. She is one of the five or six noblest
                    women I have come across; I say this quite deliberately. I would give a great deal
                    to be able to meet &amp; talk with such an one often, &amp; I am sorry that the C's
                    are going away to the country for Easter for my own sake; though on the other hand it
                    is a sin that such a superb creature should be cooped up in a place like London,
                    under society restrictions at all, &amp; as she is nearing the time of motherhood,
                    one ought only to be glad at her escape to the fields &amp; flowers &amp; free air.
                    Costelloe<a href="#n6114" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6114">10</a> himself is of too <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hard</span>
                    an intellectuality I am afraid, to give us much in common, but I get on with almost
                    everybody, &amp; I can see that he is at any rate a very genuine &amp; capable
                    fellow in his way.—By the by Mrs. C. shewed me two portraits of you which I
                    had not seen before, &amp; she told me to ask you for a copy of one, called by her
                    the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">King Lear</span> one. She said <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf004r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuva_ej.00133_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fuva_ej.00133_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fuva_ej.00133_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">uva_ej.00133_large.jpg</span> she would tell you about it in her
                    next letter. Before we came away, she read out your preface to the assembled little
                    company of guests—mainly Americans, &amp; it was received with enthusiasm, for
                    besides its own natural effect she read it very impressively. Curiously enough Roden
                    Noel<a href="#n0815" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0815">11</a> had been there the same afternoon. I go down to dine
                    with him occasionally at his place near the Crystal Palace. He is very sympathetic
                    with L. of G. Costelloe was rather making fun of him from Mrs. C's description,
                    because he accepted Hegel &amp; spiritualism &amp; sundry other paradoxical
                    positions on thought. There is a fine fund of manhood in Noel though. He is better
                    on the sea-shore than in his study, where indeed he is rather apt to grow
                    unprofitably vague over questions of poetry &amp; philosophy, which is to say Roden
                    Noel &amp; Hegel chiefly.</p> 
                <p class="tei_p">I had a piece of rather awkward news about W.S. Kennedy's<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">12</a> book<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">13</a>
                    this morning. After writing many times in vain to Wilson,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">14</a> I had a note from his
                    brother to say that he is ill again, &amp; cannot arrange about the book at present,
                    returning it to me accordingly. It is very unfortunate indeed, for it is very
                    difficult to get a book of unconventional character afloat in the cockney world of
                    publishers. There is some chance of Wilson's being able
                    to take the book in the autumn, but that is such a long time to wait.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">15</a></p>
                <p class="tei_p">Spring has fairly set in here at last. I hope it is the same with you. I have many a
                    good ramble far &amp; wide here, &amp; there is much to see on the riverside always.
                    They are building a new bridge (Battersea Bge) close by, &amp; I often go &amp;
                    watch them at their pile-driving &amp; so on. The thump of the monkey on the piles
                    goes on night &amp; day; after dark they have an electric light which sends a fine
                    gleam across here. But it's <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_smb tei_unclear_cert_low">short</span>-time, &amp; 
                    I must stop for to-day. Goodbye!</p>

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
