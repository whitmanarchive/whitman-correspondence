            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for the paper "A Ship over Niagara" &amp; "Parodies."<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I recollect the story of the ship very well, it was
                often told and referred to when I was a little boy. Your letter of 23<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> and 24<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span><a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> also came this morning. I am glad the binding is settled
                and I think from your description it will do very well tho' nothing to become
                especially enthusiastic about. I shall be glad to see it. Will not the price of
                binding cut into the price of the book a good deal? [—] $1.24 is a big
                slice off $6. [—] The price of the book should have been more than
                $6. I would not have put it a cent below $10. if I had had my way.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I predict that a copy of that book will be worth
                $50 in ten years and $100. in 25 years. But I suppose you will say "we are
                living in '89 not '99 or '14." [—] So Rice <a href="#n6004" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6004">5</a> wants you to
                write for his review?<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a> I wouldn't mind if he would print
                some pieces written by your friends and leave out such miserable trash as that
                written by Kennedy<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a> a few years ago—Do you
                recollect when Pearsall Smith<a href="#n6122" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6122">8</a> brought it home and reads
                extracts from it at the teatable? The Inspector came while I was writing the above
                and I had to break off [.] (It is now <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">noon, Sunday)</span> [.] at
                11.30 last night a fire broke out in the north cottage I was at work there untill
                5o'c. this morning. The centre building was gutted but no life lost. The damage
                [mutilation] will be $4000 or $5000. [—] A lively snow storm has set
                in, we may have sleighing at last (the last snow storm /I/ told you about was a
                failure, did not amount to any thing after all /no sleighing at all this winter
                yet./). Every body at the asylum is hard at work making provision for accommodation
                of the sixty patients who occupied the north cottage. Goodly, dear Walt</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
