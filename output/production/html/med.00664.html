Perhaps next summer I shall have something definite to say about it. Just now I do not think anything can be done. Tell him also that [what] I have to say about the English <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Edition​ ">Ed.</span>​  will be first presented to him. I have many friends in England but he will be the first consulted.</p>
