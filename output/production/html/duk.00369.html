            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I have nothing of much consequence to write you this morning. A fine day this is likely to be although I am on guard. Yesterday I was over to the City &amp; saw the Boys in Ward. A. . I also went to your residence but found you absent  I enquired where you had gone &amp; when you would be at home  I could get no information on that subject, therefore I returned to the Hospital then to this Camp.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was disappointed in not seeing you  I came over on that Errand. But alas I came back without seeing you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps I will see you before I am sent a way to the front if possible</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Orders are very strict in this camp also through out the defences of Washington that is one reason why I had rather be sent to the Regiment I would not stay around this City the rest of my time in service for a considerable a mount of Pork &amp; Soft Bread</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Walt yours I received after I returned from the City to the Camp. It came all right side up</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to have you write &amp; I will scribble this as an answer at your request that you may know I received your kind &amp; welcome letter. My best wishes are with you for indeed I have found a Friend at last to the poor Soldier</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will close this by hopeing to hear from you again</p>

               <span class="tei_salute">Ever Your Friend</span>
