                    July 5 and July 12, 1869. The letter has no date marking in Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's hand. The executors did not date it, and Edwin Haviland Miller did not
                    list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:367). Based on Louisa's expectation that fractional currency bills, which Walt
                    Whitman had forwarded, would "soon be in circulation," the letter dates to early
                    July 1869, perhaps a week or two before the release of Postal Currency in the
                    15-cent denomination. The latest possible date, July 12, is derived both from
                    Louisa's expectation that Abby and Helen Price would visit soon and that Walt
                    would arrive "next month." Walt in a mid-July letter to Abby Price praised her
                    daughter Helen's visit to his mother and reported that he would "leave
                    Washington soon after the middle of August" (see his <a href="pml.00029">July 16, 1869</a> letter to Abby Price). Also see Louisa's <a href="duk.00598">July 14, 1869?</a> letter to Walt, which describes the

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    fractional currency during the Civil War, which was known as Postal Currency

                    circulation until the mid-1870s. The 15 cent note appeared only in the fourth
                    issue, which entered circulation on July 14, 1869, and its design is known as
                    the "Bust of Columbia." See Arthur L. Friedberg and Ira S. Friedberg, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Paper Money of the United States: A Complete Illustrated Guide

                        commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs.
                        Burroughs wrote several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on

                        from his mother: "What a good girl Helen is, to go and make those nice calls

                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the

                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
