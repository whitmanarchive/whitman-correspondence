        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter has reached me this morning—&amp;, as always, is welcome—I shall <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not go on</span> to Boston—am not well enough 
        (&amp; the hot spell besides)—but shall send the piece I have composed 
        for the occasion—a ten or fifteen minute piece I call the "Song of the Universal"—to be read by proxy in its place in the programme, just the same as though I were there. 
        I will next week send it you in print<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am only reconciled to Charles Eldridge's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> coming to see me Decoration Day, by taking it 
        for granted that he will consequently feel bound to visit me without fail before long—Come, Charley, by all means—It will do me good—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, John Burroughs has had a terrible &amp; sudden sorrow befall him—the sudden insanity &amp; death 
        of his young nephew, his dead sister's son, (he visited me here during the past winter) Chancy Burroughs,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> at Brooklyn two weeks since—Abruptly, mysteriously, from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">apparent</span> health &amp; strength he became 
        a raging maniac &amp; died in three days—&amp; J. B. took up the poor young man's corpse &amp; buried him 
        by his mother's side, there in the mountains of Delaware County—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">If I remember right the picture in the gilt frame is the one with the hand up at the right side of the head—so? If so, I have some of them, &amp; will give Mrs. Johnson one with the greatest pleasure—(it is one of 
        Brady's photos)—I wish you to give my best respects &amp; love to Mrs. J. and sister—Also to Garry Howard, 
        Mrs. Huntington, Mrs. Brownell &amp; in fact to "all inquiring friends"—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I still maintain the "great expectations" I have before mentioned—the severe gastric affection, 
        trouble in side &amp; breast, &amp;c still assert themselves at times—dyspepsia, from 17 months inaction—but upon the whole not so severely—&amp; I think very decidedly gradually growing less—The worst is my singular alternations, fluctuations. The heat here too is &amp; has been extreme—but I am standing it well, so far—to-day as I sit here writing, a fair breeze blowing in—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Peter Doyle has ten days since paid me a short visit of a couple of days<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—the dear, dear boy—&amp; what good it did me!—(Unfortunately it was, however, 
        at a time when I was feeling almost at my worst.) Yesterday George Bacon came, bringing a friend—&amp; we had a capital good hour &amp; a half—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">talked Spiritualism</span>—I enjoyed it though—</p>
      
      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, Nelly dear.</span>

                    "probably better than the poet himself would have rendered it…The
                    poem…is very Whitmany, being one of the most grotesque in expression and
