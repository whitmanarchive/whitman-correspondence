                  <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt,</span>
               </span>
               <p class="tei_p">Mr Lane<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> handed me your note yesterday and I enclose the within $6, $5 from myself and $1 from Mother.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I wish Walt that I could do more and will try to collect a little something. I have made one or two attempts already but failed, entirely. Have you written to any of your driver friends,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> if you could strike them I should think you might get something. Probasco<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> sent you $5 yesterday and Mr Lane would have sent you some to-day but I told him that I thought that it would be better for all concerned if we put a little time between the letters. I am in hopes to raise a few dollars more in a week or two which I will send you. I wish you would take either Lane's or Probasco['s] money and keep an exact account of what it does and send them the particulars of just the good it does. I think it would assist them (and the rest of us) in collecting more  You can understand what an effect twould have, twould give us an opportunity to show what immense good a few shillings even will do when rightly applied  besides twould please the person sending the money hugely twould bring his good deeds under his nose</p>
               <p class="tei_p">We have had some two or three letters from Heyde, directed to you. He talks like a d—m fool. He says that he saw that your feelings and sympathies were excited by the things that you saw and says that he would desire to call them a little nearer home, and then follows a lot of stuff ending with the request that you will come on and get Han and bring her home, as he cant paint. The miserable skunk. I would like to get a fair chance at his ugly mug.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> Mother has written to him that Mat will come on after Han, and we are now waiting a reply. The day after each letter came to you mother would get one from him, stating that he was under the influene of quinine and soda, and that he had boils, on his rump bone, and that his blood was bad (d—m his blood) and that he couldn't paint) and that charity, public charity, would have to relieve them, and a hell of a lot of other things all <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">meaning</span> that he wants to shake Han off. Undoubtedly we shall have her home before long. He says she is sick, but I think that if she was she would write home herself. It makes mother feel pretty bad. that combined with all her other troubles, I think, shows on her. She of course is with Mat and I most of the time and we try to make things as pleasant as possible  Ed and Jess are the same as usual</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Mr Lane says that we ought to do something to help you to get a situation there  If we can do any thing in the way of letters let us know. Lane thinks that you might do something with Dana.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> Can you? Did you get the papers that I sent you, I sent 15 copies.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> Walt write me as often as possible as you cannot imagine how interesting they are to me. We all read them, Lane Probasco &amp;c &amp;c. They make us see things through new eyes</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Mother is about as well as usual. Mattie ditto. Sis is growing more interesting than ever, and more mischiefous than the old dickens  she talks of you and Uncle George quite often  Mother and Mat send their love. Mat says she is much obliged for her letter and will answer it herself soon.<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> What are you doing and how are you getting along? Things the same as usual with me. Write me soon and often  We had a long letter from George to-day  He says he thinks that he will try for a furlough and that if they wont let him have it that he may resign. I rather think Walt that he is more tired than he lets us know. I wish to God that he would come home, I think that it would add 10 years to Mothers life. Write him. With love from all dear brother  Good night</p>

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27,
                        1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in
                    the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman
                    wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of
                    money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
                    (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
                    Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00396_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00396_n2"><span>In a letter of <a href="wwh.00004">January 16, 1863</a>, Walt Whitman indicated that Jeff
                    and his mother ought not to make personal contributions to the hospital fund
                    since he himself was carrying the family's share of the national burden.
                    Nonetheless, and despite his own shortage of funds, Jeff continued to
                    contribute. See Jeff's letter of <a href="loc.00416">July 7, 1863</a>.
