                have the whole history of

                and audacity in print
                I will not weary you with
                writing it here—. I have
                received a very kind note
                from Mr O'Connor from
                whose splendid article I 
                quoted—containing the offer
                of his kind offices at
                Washington. As I cannot
                think there can be another

                I have a circulation of 2600—scattered all over the Union—Canada—&amp; a few of them
                in England Scotland France
                Switzerland Italy Australia
                New Zealand &amp; the West Indies
                among whom you have many ardent admirers—When I first
                lectured from Leaves of Grass
                I received many expressions of
                gratitude from them—I am sorry that last Winter
                I allowed a press of business
                to lead me to postpone calling
                on you until I found that
                it was too late—. I am 
                however loath to intrude my

                your personal inscription on the
