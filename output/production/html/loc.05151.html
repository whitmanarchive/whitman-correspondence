                evolution of good out of evil as his keynote, and that must surely be the keynote of
                any sane philosophy. But what good? and when? and where? For suppose all the good

                be any improvement on the present state of things, since so much of the beauty and
                power of virtue is only thinkable when existing in the midst of evil, &amp; seen on
                that background. Here then is a strange frame of mind, yet common to us all—we
                feel it an imperious duty or a thrilling impulse to take part on the right side in
                the great conflict, and fight therein on the principle of 'No Surrender,' yet we
                think at the same time that the victory we strive for is never to be gained, is not
                even conceiveably gainable. What is the justification of this seeming absurdity! I
                suppose it must be this, that the Good we are really striving for transcends our
                powers of concrete imagination: in the strife we fix our minds on something definite
                and practical &amp; make that our ostensible aim, while really working,
                unconsciously, perhaps, most of us, for a Good not to be expressed in terms of
                practical virtue. What private soldier of Frederick the Great, storming Torgau under
                the fire of 400 cannon, felt—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">or if he felt could have

                as yet not nearly gauged in its true significance, the establishment of a German
                nation. The ridge of a bushy hill, which he should leave tomorrow, never to see
                again, represented for him that great object.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now that I am on speculative matters, I will tell you of an important judgment on
                Darwinism recently delivered by the highest European authority on such subjects,
                viz, Professor Virchow.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> He is a wide minded man, of
                strong character (a leader of the Radical politicians in Germany) &amp; of immense
                knowledge in all domains of science, particularly anthropology. His judgment is that
                of a serious thinker, who will take 20 years to make up his mind rather than say an
                unconsidered word, and he is said to exercise, in scientific matters, a mind of
                absolute impartiality and clearness. Recently then, <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">some 2 months ago, I think,</sup> he has delivered an
                address before the German Anthropological Soc. at Halle, which takes Darwinism as
                its subject, and utters an unqualified condemnation of that theory. He says it is an
                illustration of the pernicious 'Naturphilosophie' which tries to force theories on
                Nature, and supposes that scientific truth can be reached by mere speculation,
                instead of by patiently studying the facts of physical life. When the theory was
                first proposed he was not carried off his feet by the waves of enthusiasm around
                him. He was content to wait, taking the theory for what it was worth, for the proof
                or disproof which the researchers <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01040_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01040_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01040_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01040_large.jpg</span> of the next few decades (dominated
                as they have been by the desire to find facts bearing on that theory) would
                certainly bring. Now he <span class="tei_add_rend_insertion_mark">^</span><sup class="tei_add tei_add_rend_insertion tei_add_place_supralinear">feels
                    himself</sup> entitled to say that the proof has not been forthcoming, and the
                disproof has. And he is confirmed by seeing that a perceptible 'disillusionment' has
                already made its appearance among many who were the most vigorous supporters of
                Darwinism. It must be remembered that the 'Darwinism' here sentenced to death is not
                synonymous with evolution. The latter doctrine existed, of course, before
                D.—he only offered an explanation of it—&amp; that explanation consisted
                in the putting forward of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">merely mechanical law</span> of
                'Natural Selection of the (physically) Fittest' as the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">only</span> cause needed to explain <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> the phenomena
                of organization. This cause does doubtless work, but V. denies that it accounts for
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span> the facts, and if it does not account for all, it
                is by no means of the importance at first supposed. Such an utterance as this of
                Virchow's ought to go far towards abating the dogmatic intolerance with which most
                Darwinists regard all who refuse to take their doctrine as the central pivot for all
                thinking.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps you have already heard of Virchow's speech, in which case, pardon this
                Mittheilung. If you didn't know of it I expected it would interest you.</p>

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    Hegelian influence on Whitman has been recognized, though there are varying
                    opinions as to the nature of the relationship: whether Hegel was a source for
                    many of Whitman's ideas or whether Whitman simply paralleled his expressions of
                    thought. In any event, such Whitman concepts as cosmic evolution, pantheistic
                    "unity," and the synthesis of Good in which the antithesis, Evil, merges and
                    disappears are part of the Hegelian philosophy. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.05151_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_frenz tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.05151_n3"><span>The eminent director of
                    the Pathological Institute in Berlin, Dr. Rudolf Virchow, was an interested
                    commentator on the controversial question of evolution and Darwinism. Dr.
                    Virchow delivered an important lecture in Munich on September 22, 1877, which
                    seems to parallel the later talk in its emphasis on the necessity of
                    distinguishing between science in the state of hypothesis and science in the
                    state of fact. For example, he writes in the preface to the English translation
                    of his lecture: "Nothing was any further from his intention than any wish to
                    disparage the great services rendered by Mr. Darwin to the advancement of
                    biological science, of which no one has expressed more admiration than himself.
                    On the other hand, it seems high time to him to enter an energetic protest
                    against the attempts that are made to proclaim the problems of research as
                    actual facts, and the opinions of scientists as established science" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fragments of Science</span>, ed. John Tyndall [6th edition, New
