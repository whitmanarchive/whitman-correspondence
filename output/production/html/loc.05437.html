            <p class="tei_p">I feel but little in the humour for writing any thing that will have the stamp of
                cheerfulness.—Perhaps it would be best therefore not to write at all, and I
                don't think I should, were it not for the hope of getting a reply.—I believe
                when the Lord created the world, he used up all the good stuff, and was forced to
                form Woodbury and its denizens, out of the fag ends, the scraps and refuse: for a
                more unsophisticated race than lives hereabouts you will seldom meet with in your
                travels.—They get up in the morning, and toil through the day, with no
                interregnum of joy or leisure, except breakfast and dinner.—They live on salt
                pork and cucumbers; and for a delicacy they sometimes treat company to
                rye-cake and buttermilk.—Is not this enough to send them to perdition
                "uncancelled, unanointed, unannealed?"—If Chesterfield were forced to live
                here ten hours he would fret himself to death: I have heard the words "thank you,"
                but once since my sojuorn in this earthly purgatory.—Now is the season for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01470_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gk.01470_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01470_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> what they call
                "huckleberry frolicks."—I had the inestimable ecstasy of being invited to one
                of these refined amusements.—I went.—We each carried a tin pail, or a
                basket, or a big bowl, or a pudding bag.—It was fun no doubt, but it cost me
                two mortal pounds of flesh, besides numerous remnants of my apparrel, which still
                remain, for what I know, on the briars and bushes.—Wasn't it hot!—And
                then our dinner—our <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pic-nic</span>
                dinner!—There's the rub!—Guess now what we had.—A
                broken-bowl half full of cold potatoes; three or four bones thinly garnished
                with dirty, greasy ham; a huge pie, made out of green apples, molasses, and
                buckwheat crust; six radishes, and a tin pan of boiled beans!!—And all this
                had to be washed down with a drink they called "switc<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hell</span>," a villanous compound, as near as I could discover, of water, vinegar,
                and brown sugar.—Our conversation, too, was a caution to white folks; it
                consisted principally, as you may imagine, of ethereal flashes of wit, scraps of
                Homeric and Italian poetry, disquisitions on science and the arts, quotations from
                the most learned writers, and suggestions on the speediest way of making
                butter.—Tim Hewlett vowed he ought to have a buss from Patty Strong; Patty
                modestly declined the honour.—A struggle was the result, in which Tim's face
                received permanent marks of the length of Patty's finger nails; and the comb of that
                vigorous young damsel <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01471_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gk.01471_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01471_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> lost some of its fair proportions.—It was a drawn
                battle.—At the conclusion of this performance, we gathered together our forces
                and the, bowls, baskets, and pudding-bags aforesaid, and returned home: for my
                part feeling "particularly and peculiarly <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">kewrious</span>" from
                the weight of amusement.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am much obliged for the paper you sent me.—Write soon.—Send me
                something funny; for I am getting to be a miserable kind of a dog: I am sick
                of wearing away by inches, and spending the fairest portion of my little span of
                life, here in this nest of bears, this forsaken of all Go<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_jh tei_unclear_cert_high">d's</span> creation; among clowns and country
                bumpkins <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_torn-away tei_gap_quantity_4 tei_gap_unit_chars">[torn-away]</span> flat-heads, and
                coarse brown-faced girls, dirty, ill-favored young brats, with squalling
                throats and rude manners, and bog-trotters, with all the disgusting conceit,
                of ignorance and vulgarity.—It is enough to make the fountains of
                good-will dry up in our hearts, to wither all gentle and loving dispositions,
                when we are forced to descend and be as one among the grossest, the most
                low-minded of the human race.—Life is a dreary road, at the best; and I
                am just at this time in one of the most stony, rough, desert, hilly, and
                heart-sickening parts of the journey.—But Time is the Great Physician
                who cures, they say, our ills of mind and body.—I pray the fates he may rid me
                of my spleen ere long</p>
