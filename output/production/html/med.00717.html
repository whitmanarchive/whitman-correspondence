            <p class="tei_p">Thank the Columbus Buggy Co., and their workmen, for the beautiful looking and
                practically perfect buggy furnished me. I get out in it every day—my only
                exercise—and I find it the easiest riding vehicle I ever sat in. Thank them
                for a most opportune kindness and generosity to me. </p>

                    (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
                    introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
                    the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
                    carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman, the Man</span> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
