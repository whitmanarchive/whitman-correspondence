        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I must first tell you what will please you best, namely that I [am] feeling <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">decidedly better 
        than usual</span> this morning—I have spent an hour in the bath room, (quite my regular test,) 
        &amp; come out not only without any diminution of strength or elasticity—but an increase—&amp; with a visit or descending upon me like of a long-absent feeling of physical ease 
        &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">unconsciousness</span>, which I will welcome as a precursor, even if [it] soon passes over 
        (as it doubtless will)—but hope for return. For I suppose you know that my condition 
        is very tantalizing in its fluctuations—Like today as I write—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">now</span> the sun is out bright enough—&amp; fifteen minutes since, I noticed from the window quite a flurry of snow—&amp; cloudy—At any rate I am feeling again to-day one of the glimpses I had or was beginning to have 
        last May, before mother died—am under its influence &amp; benefit to-day—&amp; you shall have the good of it, Nelly dear—as far as this note can give.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Poor, poor, Ada Clare—I have been inexpressibly shocked by the horrible &amp; sudden close 
        of her gay, easy, sunny free, loose, but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not ungood</span> life—I suppose you have seen about it, 
        but I cut the enclosed from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> in case you have not<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your letter—I send <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">W. Graphics</span> of 21st &amp; 28th as you request—The W. G. of 7th March is my last no.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—did you get it?—I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  Charley's letter—Love to you &amp; all—I feel to-day as though we shall yet be together again &amp; have better times than ever, Nelly dear.
