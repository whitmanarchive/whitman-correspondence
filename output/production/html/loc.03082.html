                on W W. As before his plain utterance seemed to you, so now to me. This seems
                somehow comic—so inadequate is it &amp; "off." Yet there is some good weft in the
                shoddy—a little. S. lacks healthy contact with the live world. Did you ever
                hear that the Booths<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> were of Dutch origin? Mrs K.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> is sure she read it. I have searched all the books in vain,
                tho' I find a little Welsh blood in their family. What curious blood—heating broad-fanned South winds! Have
                been dipping into Boccaccio.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> He is a healthy fellow, but his stories are too much
                for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">any</span> flesh. My imagination is too vivid. I have to
                throw him aside.</p>

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
