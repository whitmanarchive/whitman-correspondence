            <p class="tei_p">Have just read the piece of our little spectacled brother Symond
                on W W. As before his plain utterance seemed to you, so now to me. This seems
                somehow comic—so inadequate is it &amp; "off." Yet there is some good weft in the
                shoddy—a little. S. lacks healthy contact with the live world. Did you ever
                hear that the Booths were of Dutch origin? Mrs K. is sure she read it. I have searched all the books in vain,
                tho' I find a little Welsh blood in their family. What curious blood—heating broad-fanned South winds! Have
                been dipping into Boccaccio. He is a healthy fellow, but his stories are too much
                for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">any</span> flesh. My imagination is too vivid. I have to
                throw him aside.</p>
