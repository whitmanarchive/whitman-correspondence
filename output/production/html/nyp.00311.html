        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I still remain here in Camden, &amp; in a condition not much different—alternating constantly between the bad spells, &amp; then hours, &amp; sometimes days, 
        not so bad. I suppose you rec'd the little Philadelphia paper I sent a week since—Dr. Grier here is confident my principal trouble is cerebral anæmia (blood not 
        properly going to the brain to nourish it)—says it arises from a long 
        continued excessive emotional action generally<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—&amp; thinks it so has arisen in my case—does not think writing, or study, or ordinary brain action has been the cause—it has been long a-coming &amp; will probably be long a-going—thinks I will get well however.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">He thinks it has been coming on for many years, says I need rest, rest for a long time 
        &amp; social exhilaration—(The paralysis, according to him, is only an incident, or result, 
        &amp; not the cause-disease)—Since I have been here I have followed Dr. Drinkard's advice—taken no medicine, &amp; lived very prudently—(I still quite thoroughly believe in Dr. Drinkard)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charles Eldridge called upon me on his way back—his visit was a great treat, 
        &amp; was only too short—I rec'd a letter from him a few days since—all goes on as usual in Washington matters we are interested in—I have a substitute<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> working for me at my desk, and he seems to give satisfaction—When I shall be able to go to work again, if ever, is as indefinite now as it has been for over seven months—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  a letter from John Burroughs. He has bought some land at Esopus, 
        on the Hudson, west bank, some 80 miles from New York, &amp; is going 
        to build him a house &amp; home there forthwith.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I get out some—went over to Philadelphia yesterday—go sometimes 
        to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, as it is very pleasant there 
        for a change—or rather for a place to go to &amp; rest—though the atmosphere 
        of a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">reading room</span> soon weighs on me, &amp; I feel like retreating—Yesterday 
        took a ride up in the Market <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Street​ ">st.</span>​  cars to West Philadelphia—&amp; was caught in a violent shower coming home in the evening, &amp; nicely soaked—Soon as I got home it stopt, and we had a splendid moonlight evening—It is bright &amp; clear to-day, &amp; rather hot—It is socially here an utter blank to me—my cynical dread of being bored by any one is now completely gratified with a vengeance—I look long &amp; long at my mother's miniature, &amp; at my sister Mat's—I have very good one's of each—&amp; O the wish if I could only be with them—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, this has grown to be a perturbed sort of letter—&amp; had better be torn up—but I will let it go.
      </p>
