                   during the American Civil War. He was the son of William H.

                    his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s <a href="nyp.00157">January 9, 1864</a>,
                    letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H

                    Whitman on <a href="nyp.00176">January 12, 1865</a>, thanking him for his
                    letter (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find
                    words to tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live
                    to meet again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere

                    worked for many years at the plant of the American Car and Foundry Company ("Old Soldier Dies,"
