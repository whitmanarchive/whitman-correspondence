            <p class="tei_p">An incipient "cold in the head" (from an open sash behind me two hours yesterday
                toward evn'g forgotten)—may pass over lightly—may grow
                worse—(generally of late seems to settle on, merge in bladder
                trouble)—Otherwise matters much the same—partial bowel action (thankful
                for that)—half sunny weather this forenoon, rather cold—The "Magazine of
                Poetry" from you came—all looks better than I w'd have
                anticipated—pictures, print, paper very fair—I see I appear quite
                largely—good biographic sketch f'm y'r pen I accept &amp; like well—quite many names I had not heard
                before—rather an apotheosis of good mediocrity isn't it? &amp; why not?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special—I am sitting by the stove alone—partial bowel dejection
                an hour ago—no letters rec'd this morn'g—sell two copies <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov: B</span> to-day—I send papers &amp; p[ost] cards to
                    O'C[onnor] every other day—nothing very late from
                him—cloudy dark raw here like snow in prospect—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">McKay is going off "on the road" (book selling &amp;c) in ab't a
                week—takes the new bound big book" with him—wants of me, a formal pledge
                that there will be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no more complete works</span> like this issued by
                me—but I refuse—(altho' I feel confident there will not, yet I prefer to
                keep it open)—I sell the C W to McK h'f calf bound for $4—so you see I
                    don't indeed make much—will soon send you a printed slip of the Sarrazin fragment as the proof from K[ennedy] has
                come in the 2 p m mail. It seems but a fragment, but a typical one—Y'rs came
