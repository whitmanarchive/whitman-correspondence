                    December 28, 1868. "December 28" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and
                    Richard Maurice Bucke added the date notation "1868 (?)" on the first page.
                    Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    2:366). The year 1868 is corroborated by Louisa's reference to a tragic fire in
                    Richmond: a housekeeper and at least five men died ("The Richmond Calamity," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, December 28, 1868, 3). </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00636_n9 note" id="duk.00636_n9"><span>Walt Whitman's late December

                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her <a href="duk.00475">February 27,
                        1867</a> letter to Walt that he had sent her two almanacs the previous

                    Walt is the same as the one mentioned above, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman later
                    refers to "all letters." Therefore, Walt probably sent two letters to his mother
                    between December 21 and December 26, 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r30">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00636_n7 note" id="duk.00636_n7"><span>The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Directory</span> (1868) lists a Cephas Gill at 188 Myrtle Avenue as

                    Van Velsor Whitman had purchased a supply of coal the previous month (see her

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
                    pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
                    poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
