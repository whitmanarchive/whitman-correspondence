            christmas) O walt aint
            it sad about that young
            woman perhaps if she
            hadent got married she
            would have got over it
            the excitement probably
            aggravated the disease)
            it
            is sad indeed to read although
            strangers) i got the letter
            this morning all letters
            come first rate) i gave
            the carrier a dollar for
            his christmas he was much
            pleased such things go a
            great ways in having him
            punctual) i am as well
            as usual sleep pretty well
            i went down to gill s and
            got a stove
                for the back room
            on georgeys credit i have
            some company not very much
            i see a short account of the richm   
            fire but i had no idea it was
            so horrible)
            with many thanks for
            money and books i remain yo   
                affectionte 
                mother</p>
