            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special to write you, about myself, or any thing else, this week. Your letter &amp; the Herald came last Monday. 
                The time goes very tedious with me—&amp; yet I think I am getting better, (but don't know for sure.)—Still have frequent bad spells.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—I stopt at the W. Philadelphia depot, Market street, two or three evenings ago, in the general passengers' room, 
                to rest, about 10 minutes. Then took the car for Market st. ferry, (a mile and a half, or three quarters) 
                &amp; over to Camden, home.—I get desperate at staying in,—not a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">human</span> soul for cheer, or sociability or fun—&amp; this continued week after week &amp; month after month—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">So you met Johnny Saunders, in Baltimore, &amp; he is flourishing. If you see him again, 
                tell him to write to me,—he is a young man I always loved.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">½ past 2</span>—I have just had a nice oyster stew for my dinner—it is blustering weather, partly clear, 
                partly cloudy, &amp; one or two little flirts of snow to-day. I send you a paper or two, but nothing in them. 
                I will try to stop in Philadelphia &amp; find that little dictionary I promised you—</p><p class="tei_p">So long, my loving son,</p>

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
