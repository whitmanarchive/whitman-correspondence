            <p class="tei_p">I send you the Carlyle piece as requested—Mail me a
                proof, if possible—if Tuesday forenoon I can return it Tuesday night—If
                not possible pray read proof with extra care by copy—It ought to make just a
                page—I want without fail fifty impressions of just that page. It can easily be
                done in the printing office—Another thing I forget to mention before (&amp;
                perhaps is not strictly needed any how) I reserve the right to print any of my
                pieces in future book—&amp; to make it clearer, would you &amp; J B kindly, after signing, return to me the accompanying
                    page?</p>
