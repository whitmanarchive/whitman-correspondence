            <p class="tei_p">Last week I spent three days among my kinsfolk in the North; &amp; a very
                heart-gladdening time I had. The weather was almost typically spring-like in
                character—westerly winds with some rain &amp; intermittent sunshine &amp; the
                previously stagnant vegetation had made wonderful progress; the new corn 
                shewing
                above the brown earth &amp; the trees &amp; hedgerows tipped with delicate green,

                lives—I saw my first swallows of this spring, darting high overhead or
                skimming the sunlit waters of the beautiful River Eden. The woods there are now all
                carpeted with daffodils &amp; primroses; the greening meadows are bedecked with the
                yellow-starred celandine &amp; the "wee, modest crimson-tipped
                flower,"<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">9</a> with its golden eye; &amp; Nature is robing herself in her vernal mantle of

            <p class="tei_p">The first market-day in May is the "Fair-Day" at Annan &amp; I was present at this
                fair—the first time for about 15 years. It is a relic of olden times &amp;
                still preserves its primitive chahracter—shows, merry-go-rounds, conjurors,
                cheap Jacks, sweetie, toffee &amp; toy stalls, farm produce, shooting galleries,
                &amp;c &amp;c all 'in the streets.'</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the</span> peculiar feature about it is the Hiring system. The farmers &amp; the
                servants all congregate—in a certain portion of the High St &amp; when the
                master sees a servant whom he thinks likely to suit he accosts him or her &amp; by a
                series of questions &amp; answers an agreement is come to, the bargain being
                clinched by the giving &amp; receiving of some money—generally a shilling or
                two which is called the "earles"—thus constituting a legal contract binding
                upon both parties.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">After enjoying "all the fun of the fair" I strolled along the banks of my beloved
                "Annan Water"—a really beauitiful river which meanders its way from the Moffat
                hills, past the town &amp; on to the Solway Firth referred to by Scott<a href="#n4277" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4277">15</a> in the

                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man
