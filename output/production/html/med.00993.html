            <p class="tei_p">The weather here still continues excessively cold—the
                earth being covered with snow and ice, from an inch to six inches thick. Day and
                night we are saluted by merry sleigh-bells, all along the streets. The omnibuses vie
                with each other in the gayety and flitter of their turn-outs, and it is one of the
                sights worth looking at, to stand on the side-walk and see them pass along. Not even
                the private vehicles, sleigh-fashion, rich as some of their caparisonings are, can
                compete with those same omnibuses. With their superb white horses—the rims of the
                dash-boards arching over like the necks of serpents—and from twenty to a hundred
                ladies and gents "inside"—you may imagine what a show they present!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Just after dark
                sets in, Broadway presents the appearance of an illuminated carnival—even the fancy
                dresses are made up by the grotesque look of many of the sleighs. Outredom seems
                ransacked to furnish patterns for the "fancy" to put on runners. I have noticed
                several sea-serpents, a mer-maid or two and dolphins are quite common.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are much
                concerned at the sad accounts from New Orleans respecting the cholera.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">1</a> It is,
                however, the confident supposition that before this date, this disease must have
                subsided, if not left you entirely. Thousands of anxious hearts listen here with
                eager interest to each successive instalment of the news on this melancholy matter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In our neighborhood—the Quarantine station at Staten Island—no cases of the cholera
                occurred during Thursday and Friday last, and the Health Officer has ceased making
                any reports. Not the least alarm is felt here on the subject. Next summer I fear it
                will be a different affair; but let next summer take care of itself.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Ice begins to
                make its appearance in the East river, floating along in "pretty considerable"
                masses, too, at times. Some of the weather-wise predict a continuation of the severe
                cold, and, as a natural consequence, a hard winter. Heaven knows, if the weather
                lasts like it has been for the past week, the coal-yards and the provision-dealers
                will haul in lots of money. All work for out-of-door mechanics has completely
                stopped; immense rows of buildings in the "burnt district"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> of Brooklyn having been
                embargoed in the suddenest manner possible. And oh! what noses you may see, early in
                the morning, at the street corners!</p>

                    1848, at night, a fire broke out in a furniture store on Fulton Street in New
                    York. The fire spread quickly to the wooden buildings nearby, all of which were
                    dry as the result of a long drought. It was six hours before the fire could be
                    stopped. During that time, the fire burned approximately eight city blocks and
                    destroyed about two hundred buildings in the densely populated area in the
                    vicinity of Fulton and Nassau Streets ("The Doings of a Night," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, September 11, 1848, 2). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
