                    Carpenter's letter of <a href="loc.01237">March 16</a>, in which he
                    enclosed a letter from a friend named Sharp(?), who termed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> "a barbaric work" and Whitman "the poet of anarchy,
                    confusion, lawlessness, disorder, 'anomia,' chaos," who was not even
                    "cosmopolitan" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:252–253). Whitman was
                    amused and impressed: "I kind o' take to the man: he tumbles me clear over as a
                    matter of conscience—I respect him for it" (Traubel, 1:253). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
