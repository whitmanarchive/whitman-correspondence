        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I am certainly getting well again—I have made a great improvement
        the last three days, &amp; my head feels clear &amp; good nearly all the time—&amp;
        that, the doctor says, will bring my leg all right in a little while—Yesterday was a
        beautiful day, &amp; I was out a good deal—walked some, a couple of blocks, for the
        first time—Peter Doyle convoyed me—This morning I have had my breakfast, and
        have been sitting by my open window looking out—it is very pleasant &amp; warm, but
        cloudy—we have heavy showers here nights—too much rain indeed—still spring
        is very fine here, &amp; it looks beautiful from my windows—I am writing this in my
        room—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am feeling just now well as usual in my general health—part of the time, just as
        well as ever—but of course I expect a few set–backs before I get well entirely, &amp;
        supple in my limbs—It is remarkable how much paralysis there is—cases occur
        here, every few days—&amp; in other cities—There is quite a time here about the
        burial of Mr. Chase, his body is at the Capitol to–day, &amp; he
        is buried to–morrow—mother, the paper I send you has a picture of a railroad depot
        they are building here—it is for the road Peter Doyle works on—You will see a
        piece in that paper about the Beecher and Tilton scandal—it is very coarse—I think Beecher a great humbug, but I don't believe there
        is any truth in that piece—(but of course don't know)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still having electricity applied—the doctor applied it yesterday—I am
        certainly getting along better the last few days—feel better—feel more like
        myself—I shall come &amp; pay you a visit the first part of next month—shall
        write before I come, the time, &amp;c—Mother, I hope this will find you feeling
        better—I shall be anxious to hear—write a line or two, Tuesday—As I sit by
        the window this forenoon looking out, I wish you could take a look at the prospect, it is so
        fine, the trees &amp; grass so green, and the river &amp; hills in the distance—it
        does one good to look at it—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Mother, I shall feel anxious until I hear from you—</span>
