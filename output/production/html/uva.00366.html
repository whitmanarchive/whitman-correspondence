      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I am certainly getting well again—I have made a great improvement
        the last three days, &amp; my head feels clear &amp; good nearly all the time—&amp;
        that, the doctor says, will bring my leg all right in a little while—Yesterday was a
        beautiful day, &amp; I was out a good deal—walked some, a couple of blocks, for the
        first time—Peter Doyle convoyed me—This morning I have had my breakfast, and
        have been sitting by my open window looking out—it is very pleasant &amp; warm, but
        cloudy—we have heavy showers here nights—too much rain indeed—still spring
        is very fine here, &amp; it looks beautiful from my windows—I am writing this in my
        room—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am feeling just now well as usual in my general health—part of the time, just as
        well as ever—but of course I expect a few set–backs before I get well entirely, &amp;
        supple in my limbs—It is remarkable how much paralysis there is—cases occur
        here, every few days—&amp; in other cities—There is quite a time here about the
        burial of Mr. Chase,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> his body is at the Capitol to–day, &amp; he
        is buried to–morrow—mother, the paper I send you has a picture of a railroad depot
        they are building here—it is for the road Peter Doyle works on—You will see a
        piece in that paper about the Beecher and Tilton scandal<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—it is very coarse—I think Beecher a great humbug, but I don't believe there
        is any truth in that piece—(but of course don't know)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still having electricity applied—the doctor applied it yesterday—I am
        certainly getting along better the last few days—feel better—feel more like
        myself—I shall come &amp; pay you a visit the first part of next month—shall
        write before I come, the time, &amp;c—Mother, I hope this will find you feeling
        better—I shall be anxious to hear—write a line or two, Tuesday—As I sit by
        the window this forenoon looking out, I wish you could take a look at the prospect, it is so
        fine, the trees &amp; grass so green, and the river &amp; hills in the distance—it
        does one good to look at it—</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Mother, I shall feel anxious until I hear from you—</span>

                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    protégé of Henry Ward Beecher, accused his mentor on December 30,
                    1870, of improper relations with his wife. The accusation was suppressed by all
                    parties until a sensational account of Beecher's relations with Tilton's family
                    appeared on November 2, 1872, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Woodhill and Claffin's
                        Weekly</span>. Strangely, Beecher did not make a public denial until June 30,
                    1873. After Tilton published in June 1874 a statement concerning Beecher's
                    alleged misconduct, a committee from the minister's church examined the
                    allegations and exonerated Beecher. On August 20, 1874, Tilton accused Beecher
                    of adultery and asked $100,000 in damages. The trial lasted for six months
                    and ended in a split verdict. In 1875 a committee of the Congregational churches
                    found Beecher innocent. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
