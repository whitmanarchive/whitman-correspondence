            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Do your remember how I visited you in Camden one day last June? Perhaps you will remember me by the bouquet of ferns and
                larkspurs. Now I am out here, and circumstances contrary to my wishes, will keep me
                here indefinitely.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This is one of my homesick days, and I have been thinking over what there is in the
                north that I would so much like to see, and hear, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03212.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03212.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03212.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03212.002_large.jpg</span> and among other things I think how
                much I would like to see you again, and hear you say, as you did before, "I'm glad
                you came!" I often think about you, and you have written so many lines for me that I
                wish to say a word back.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I read I say "Yes, I am she, O you wise poet," and sometimes I think I must
                put out my hand for you; and I am sure that we have gone together down that brown
                road a great many times; and perhaps it was my pulse that you heard, like "little
                tinkling bells."<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am very glad my eyes found the message you hid away for me—hid so deeply,
                though, that I barely found it, and at first doubted if there was a message there,
                or if it was for me.</p>
