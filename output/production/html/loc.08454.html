                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Bucke was traveling abroad in England in an attempt to establish a foreign
                    market for a fluid meter he was building with his brother-in-law William John
                    Gurd (1845–1903). During this trip, he also visited several of Whitman's
                    English friends, including the political activist and art historian Mary
                    Whithall Smith Costelloe (1864–1945) and her first husband, the lawyer
                    Benjamin Conn Costello (1854–1899). This letter was written on either 1 or
                    2 August 1891 from the Costelloes' home at 41 Grosvenor Road in London. In his
                    letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.08164">July 31, 1891</a>, Bucke notes
                    that he has "received an invitation from Mary Costelloe to accompany her to the
                    country (Hazelmere) next Sunday evening [i.e. August 2, 1891]." Apparently Bucke
                    had been invited to spend a day or two with the Costelloes before leaving for
                    Friday's Hill, the country house of Mary Costelloe's parents, the evangelical
                    minister Robert Pearsall (1827–1898) and his wife Hannah Whitall Smith

                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
