                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Hank</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of yesterday rec'd this afternoon, &amp; glad to hear from you &amp; the
                folks—I hear from you now &amp; then by Hoag or
                Burr, who tell me they meet you up here frequently—(I wish you had said how
                Hieneken is getting along—is he getting better?)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, Hank, my Boston tramp, lecture, &amp;c. turned out far ahead of what I had any
                idea of—it was not a very large room, but it was packed full (at $1 a head)
                &amp; they say there never was a more <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">high toned crowd</span>
                collected in the town—full half were ladies, &amp; I never saw finer
                ones—I had good quarters at the principal hotel, the Revere House,
                (dead-headed, the proprietor, Mr Ferrin invited me to stay as long as I
                liked)—&amp; callers all the time—So, boy, you see how your uncle was
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">set up</span>—&amp; yet I am going to speak to all my old
                friends just the same! !</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have had several little jobs writing lately—Phila: and N. Y. papers—(will send you the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span>
                of the latter city next Monday or Tuesday with my piece in)—Havn't felt very
                well lately—a real bad spell last night &amp; this forenoon—don't feel
                right living in the city any how, after the summer comes on—very possibly
                shall go off to Canada again, as Dr and Mrs B[ucke] wish me to, &amp; write
                strongly—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent you a little book of poetry by a boy 13 years old, in Pennsylvania, he sent it
                to me with a nice letter—Well, Hank, my sheet is
                short &amp; most full, &amp; I must come to a close—I gather by your letter
                that you are in good spirits—love to you &amp; God bless you—I am sorry
                enough to hear your mother is unwell—Susan, my dear friend, I hope when this
                comes you will be all right—</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">I suppose your mother got a letter &amp; some papers from Boston, as I sent them, &amp; of course supposed you would
                    all read them—my best love to your mother &amp; father &amp; I want you to
                    let them read this—</p>
