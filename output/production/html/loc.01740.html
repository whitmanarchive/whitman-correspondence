                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    returned to Washington on June 2, as planned. Unwell and depressed, he finally
                    went to the home of the Ashtons, where he at least did not have to climb to the
                    fourth floor. About June 16 he returned to Camden. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_loc.01740_n2 note" id="loc.01740_n2"><span>At this point in the letter,
                    Richard Maurice Bucke, one of Whitman's literary executors, wrote handwritten
                    comments directly on Whitman's letter (later crossed out by a diagonal line):
                    "He had left Washington some two weeks before this letter was written. Had been
                    lying sick in that city, paralyzed, and 'Pete' had been in with him often, to
                    wait on and assist him. His mother &amp; brother George lived in Camden, he went
                    there for a chance expedition to return to Washington. On Monday 23 June his
                    mother died suddenly. It was a terrible shock and grief to him but it seems his
                    physical state was not affected by it for the first week. On Saturday 31<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span></span> he still expects to

His letter of 9<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span></span> June (wrongly dated 7<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span></span>) shows that almost
