                you A few lines to let you know we are all
                pretty well it is very warm weather which
                makes matty and me sigh for some country
                place by the sea side I shall never I think
                regret leaving this place it is very disagreable
                to live with the B family more so than ever
                there is nothing but quarrel with Hattee on somethin<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">g</span>
                or other all the time the old brown
                has gone away
                to work at Harrisburgh I wish they were all gone
                I commenced A letter to Hanna yesterday
                but I have not finished it yet but will
                try too to day and to morrow if my head dont
                hurt me I have considerable distress in
                my head seems to affect my eyes but
                is better after I get up in the morning and
                wash my eyes in cold water matty is very
                kind to me when I dont feel well she
                has very much to doo with the young ones
                and her work they think they will put up
                some kind of A house by next spring so
                she will have it more handy to work</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I have not had but the one letter from
                george I want to hear from him very much
                I like to get letters if there aint any thing
                so very particular in them) I suppose you
                had to send one to the little girls that got
                up the fair the proceeds of which they sent
                to you I heard there were 4 mannigers and
                they concluded when you wrote the letter
                back to them one was to have possession of it
                for A few days and then the other so it was
                to go round so I suppose you have
                written the much expetted letter
                 they
                were the high order of young ladies) a lady
                opposite mr Lanes gave them the use of her
                basement for the occation</p>
