                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
                    Charles was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor

                    George enlisted in the Union Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the
                    end of the Civil War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg
                    (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove
                    (September 1864). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith and later a mason named
                    French. He would later be employed as an inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and
                    Camden.

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
                    especially close to Thomas Jefferson Whitman and his wife. Late in life, Ruggles
                    lost interest in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures
                    called "Ruggles Gems." </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li></ul>
