               <p class="tei_p">As I was abt putting these in the envelope my eye caught this blank place and I thought that 'twas a pity to let such an opportunity go. It looked like waste.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Walt, how I should like to see you, do you look the same as ever or has the immense number of unfortunate and heartworking cases given you an sobre and melancholy look.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I sometimes think, when I get thinking abt you, that it must have that effect upon you. But then the cases that you releive and those dear lives that you save must bring back the old look again. Do you suppose that you will long continue where you are? Do you think Anything will come of your trying to get office?<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I suppose it is merely a question of time and patience as regards the office. I am in hopes to be able to have a small some of money sent you every week hereafter in this way  I will ask Lane<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> to see how many names of those around in and abt. the W. W.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> will consent to give $1 per month regularly to be sent to you for Hospital purposes. I have no doubt but that some 25 or 30 names could be had and if we could send you $6 or $7 weekly twould be quite a big thing. We think then that we shall call you "The B. Watr Works soldiers Aid society" with power. Seriously, I think twould be a good thing and that I can come [by] it. I sent you $5 last week, did you get it. Twas from Mr Lane.</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Twould make you laugh to see little Hattie brush her hair and teeth. I am almost afraid she will clean them to death. She is tremendious proud of her things that Uncle Walt sent her. Twould please you to see how finely she is growing. Every day I give her a little exercise in singing two or three notes only. I think she could be made a fine musician and am going to try it.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> She often asks when you are coming home to take her out on Fort Greene.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> She often gets one of you[r] pictures and calls it her dear Uncle Walt. She knew Georges picture at once, which I think proves it to be pretty good. Mattie is as well as usual, she has no work and has not had hardly since you went away, and I am glad she has not<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>  Mother is first rate except she works to hard  I wish she wouldnt  she is foolish to clean house so much. Walt do write me a good long letter</p>

                    instructed Jeff as well: "Jeff must not make his lessons to her in music any
                    ways strong or frequent on any account—two lessons a week, of ten minutes
                    each, is enough—But then I dare say Jeff will think of all these thigs,

                    opposite the Whitman's Portland Avenue home. Whitman believed that one of his

                    Washington Park (Old Fort Greene,)…against heavy odds, during an editorship of
