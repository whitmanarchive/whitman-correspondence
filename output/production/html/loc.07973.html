                            <p class="tei_p">The cable has done few things more tragic, in its own terse and terrible way, than to announce the sudden death, last Sunday, 
                                December 6th, at Dresden, of Wolcott Balestier. To those who knew him, the news will forever remain incredible, he was so full of active boyish interest in life and work,
                                of plans and criticism, of real promise and personal significance.
                                He would make on a stranger the impression of one who meant to last long, and yet he was not of robust build. He had a look not unlike the portraits of Hazlitt<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">14</a> in his youth;
                                slight, fair, decisive of step and speech; and his whole character was almost typically American, as befitted
                                the descendant of Wolcott the Signer.<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">15</a> He had written two novels. His "Common Story"<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">16</a> in a recent Century<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">17</a> won smiling praise everywhere for its shrewd and
                                tender comprehension of women; and he had the glorious fun (it would have been his own word), of building and launching
                                "The Naulahka,"<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">18</a> pegging away, day by day, with his dear friend Rudyard Kipling.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">19</a> He had passed most of his life with books, and he found,
                                without trouble, his vocation as publisher. The new firm of Heinemann<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">20</a> &amp; Balestier started out with a vast stock of courage, and many English and American authors have reason to know that it made
                                an instant, an honorable success. Press of pleasant affairs, and the occult duty of dethroning the kings of the house of Tauchnitz, carried him this month as often before,
                                to Germany; and here, in his thirtieth year, is the inscrutable end.
                                Ships at sea, the noisy New York highways where first he studied the humanities, the all-but-uninterrupted stretch 
                                of grass from Dean's Yard, Westminster, to his door at Kensington, which made his daily walk, and which he
                                pointed out with great mischief to New Yorkers reared on din and dust—these shall know him no more.</p> 
                            <p class="tei_p">He had many illustrious friends in his delightful exile; Mr.<a href="#n0273b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0273b">21</a> and Mrs. Edmund Gosse,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">22</a> with their lovely little children, will miss him most of all.
                                What his loss is to his mother<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">23</a> and his sisters,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">24</a> one of whom, long in England at his side, was his devoted playmate, comforter and stay, cannot be put into words.
                                I shall think of him always as last I saw him—loving games and dogs and natural laughter; full of enthusiasm for literature and for old London; full of kindness for every
                                creature about him; the busy, happy, unsoiled young heart! "The peace of Heaven, The fellowship of all great souls, go with thee."</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    James and Rudyard Kipling, who married Balestier's sister. Balestier joined with

                    Germany, and dedicated to publishing continental editions of English writers.
                    They launched their series, "The English Library," in 1891. Balestier died in

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as

                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
