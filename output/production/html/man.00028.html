                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a call a week or two ago from a Cambridge fellow lecturer <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">R. D. Roberts</span>—a Welshman. He is starting for America the 20<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span> of this month—going to Iowa to spend some time
                on a farm there, then returning to England. Wants very much to see you en <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00185_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00185_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00185_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>route. He has
                asked me to write and find out where you will be the first week of August. I suppose
                you won't mind seeing him if anywhere within call. He seems a very genuine fellow (I never saw
                him before) but is rather diffident about bothering you. Says you mention Wales or
                the Welsh <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">twice</span> in your book! Could you send a postcard
                Robert D. Roberts Post Office, New York—saying <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00186_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00186_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00186_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>where you will be early in August?
                Anyhow I will tell him to call at your address in Camden.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have received a letter from Dr. Bucke—which I shall answer presently. I like
                his address to the Teachers Association very much. Thanks for several papers you
                have sent lately. I do enjoy this outdoor life and digging potatoes—and never
                mean to abandon either again! I am <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00050_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00050_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00050_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>living with a man—the best
                friend I ever had or could think to have—an iron worker, scythe riveter, and
                his little family. He often says 'I wish Walt Whitman would come over here'. Below
                my window here there is a wooded bank running down to some water, and beyond again
                about 2 miles off the hilly undulating line of the Derbyshire moors—from which
                there comes a broad fresh breeze—like being near the sea.</p>
