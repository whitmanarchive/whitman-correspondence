                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden New Republic</span>. Whitman regularly visited the
                    Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey. Whitman enjoyed the

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
