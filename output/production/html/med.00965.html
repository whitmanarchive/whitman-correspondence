                of civil unrest in Paris known as the February Revolution or the French Revolution of 1848 resulted
                in the abdication of King Louis-Philippe and the collapse of France's liberal
                constituional monarchy (the July Monarchy) that had been established under 
                Louis Philippe in 1830. The February Revoltion also fueled a larger wave of political
                revolutions throughout Europe in 1848. In the aftermath of the revolution, a republican 
                government—the French Republic—was established. </span></span> [<a href="#r1c">back</a>]</li><li id="n1b">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03571_n1b tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03571_n1b"><span>Whitman is referring to 
                    the political and cultural forces pushing for an independent Ireland
                    in the 1840s. The Young Ireland movement was an Irish
                    nationalist movement that supported Irish independence. The movement
                    had its origins in the Repeal Association's campaign to dissolve 
                    the 1800 Irish Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland.
                    Young Irelanders seceded from the Repeal Association and formed
                    the Irish Confederation, garnering a strong base in
                    Dublin, and exerting a lasting influence on subsequent separatist endeavors.
                     Young Irelanders attempted an unsuccessful insurrection in 1848 with
                     the aims of Irish independence and democratic reform and 
                    as a response to British Parliament's passage of a "Crime and Outrage Bill"
                    that enacted martial law in Ireland in an attempt to counter Irish nationalism. 
                    The Young Irelanders' rebellion in July 1848, resulted in the arrest of the movement's leaders and the collapse 
                    of the rebellion efforts. Ireland would not become self-governing until 1922. </span></span> [<a href="#r1b">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00964_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00964_n2"><span>Dysentery
