            <p class="tei_p">Han has recd all of your postals and copy of Camden Paper and Tribune; over report
                of your grand success at Madison Theatre she fairly revels in exultation. She is
                strong enough to go out now, visiting. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had a pretty fair success past winter at low prices, but just now there is a
                halt. The lake is frozen over yet, and the country roads so impeded that it interrupts all
                business. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">A new Hotel is opening here, and the proprietor encourages me much, but <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00406.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00406.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00406.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I must wait. I
                have not gone behind hand, yet our coal is exhausted, and am in need of colors: I
                have several large and small pictures on hand which I hope to sell toward June &amp; July. I would like to go to California
                on trial, yet misgivings intrude at this point, there has been so much disaster— </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Could you help me ever so little—send it to Han for my use. My sister has
                assisted me the same—to keep out of debt. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Miller continues his very enthusiastic letters— </p>
