               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">You spoke the other day, partly in fun, about the men being so undemonstrative. I thought I would write you a line, as I hear you leave the hospital tomorrow for a few weeks. Your labor of love &amp; disinterestedness here in Hospital is appreciated. I have invariably heard the Ward A patients speak of you with gratitude, sometimes with enthusiasm. They have their own ways (not outside eclat, but in manly American hearts, however rude, however undemonstrative to you). I thought it would be sweet to your tender &amp; womanly heart, to know what I have so often heard from the soldiers about you, as I sat by their sick cots. I too have learnt to love you, seeing your tender heart, &amp; your goodness to those wounded &amp; dying young menâ€”for they have grown to seem to me as my sons or dear young brothers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I am poor I cannot make you a present, but I write you this note, dear girl, knowing you will receive it in the same candor &amp; good faith it is written.</p>
