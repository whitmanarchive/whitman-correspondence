            <p class="tei_p">Glad &amp; thankful indeed for N[elly]'s card to-day, of y'r partial "let up" on y'r
                afflictions &amp; pray it may expand into a favorable &amp; lasting gain—Dr B[ucke] is here
                quite overwhelm'd with his water-meter starting organization &amp;c—I do not see much
                of him—Rather poorly with me (the spleen malady added to the others)—Quite
                possibly Dr B may come on hence on Saturday (2d) returning thence at night—</p>
