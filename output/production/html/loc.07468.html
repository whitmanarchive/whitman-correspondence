                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Camden physician who attended Whitman, visiting him nearly every day, during the
                    poet's illness of 1888–89. Walsh was the brother of William S. Walsh, an
                    American author and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Monthly
                        Magazine</span>. Whitman had a favorable opinion of Walsh because he visited
                    often, watched his patient carefully, but did not give medicine. See Whitman's
                    letter to Bucke of <a href="loc.07560">December 18, 1888</a>. Bucke had
                    arranged to have Walsh accompany Dr. Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke believed
                    it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.35.html">Wednesday, December 5, 1888</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r4162">back</a>]</li></ul>
