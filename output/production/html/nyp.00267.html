                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I find my mother in excellent spirits &amp; fair health &amp; strength, considering her age, doing her own housework as usual. We have talked much about you &amp; Nelly. I am not at all satisfied with the quarters we occupy, &amp; shall make, probably in conjunction with George, some arrangements to have a house, or home for her &amp; the youngest brother, before I leave. George is very well, lives home mainly, &amp; looks &amp; feels as hearty as can be—which is a pleasant surprise to me. I called at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> office yesterday, but found the Churches out of town—shall call again to-morrow or Tuesday.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I saw Henry Clapp—chatted pleasantly an hour with him at Pfaff's 
                over some lager—he was very cordial &amp; communicative—I saw George Clapp—he is the same good creature, apparently not shined upon by fortune's bright sun, any more than formerly. H. C. spoke of the remnants of the old Bohemian crowd—expressed contempt for William Winter
—called him Turvey-drop, &amp;c.—Stoddard, Steadman, Aldrich, Howells, Garrison, 
                &amp;c. were mentioned—there appears to be nothing new to tell about them. Garrison is the man of all work on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nation</span>. Stoddard still has his place in the Custom House. Ada Clare 
                is an actress—has lately been playing at Memphis, Tenn—is now about playing at Albany—Clapp remains as clerk in the City Hall—Spoke of your pamphlet—says he considers it absolutely one of the most vital productions in Literature. He read it through several times. It seems to have had lasting effect upon him both intellectually &amp; emotionally. Says there is nothing of its special character, ever produced, that is, upon the whole, equal to it. It is peerless. Clapp speaks in a tone of seriousness &amp; deference I never heard him use toward any other work or person—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Haggerty—Just at dusk I was up Broadway, waiting for a Fulton ferry stage, when he came down upon me with genuine Irish warmth &amp; volubility—I was glad to see him, &amp; we had a talk of some fifteen minutes there on the street—He too spoke of the pamphlet—he said when he first heard of it he went down to Huntington's &amp; bought a copy, took it home, &amp; sat down &amp; read it to his wife—when through he read it a second time—&amp; then still a third time. He says he now regularly keeps the pamphlet within reach, &amp; whenever he feels the want of something to rouse him up, &amp; put his mental energies on the alert, he resorts to it.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Mrs. Price—she asked particularly about you—Mrs. Rhinds is unwell, &amp; has been taken home by her sister, to recuperate—John's book has been largely read—at least by those interested in L. of G. and its virtuous &amp; accomplished author—&amp; has had deepest appreciation &amp; acceptance in good quarters. Show John this letter—I send him my love—William, I have not yet rec'd any letters—when any come, send them to me 1194 Atlantic st. opposite Hamilton st. My sister Mat &amp; her children are here. Farewell.</p>
