                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I find my mother in excellent spirits &amp; fair health &amp; strength, considering her age, doing her own housework as usual. We have talked much about you &amp; Nelly. I am not at all satisfied with the quarters we occupy, &amp; shall make, probably in conjunction with George, some arrangements to have a house, or home for her &amp; the youngest brother, before I leave.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> George is very well, lives home mainly, &amp; looks &amp; feels as hearty as can be—which is a pleasant surprise to me. I called at the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> office yesterday, but found the Churches out of town—shall call again to-morrow or Tuesday.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I saw Henry Clapp<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a>—chatted pleasantly an hour with him at Pfaff's<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a> 
                over some lager—he was very cordial &amp; communicative—I saw George Clapp<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">6</a>—he is the same good creature, apparently not shined upon by fortune's bright sun, any more than formerly. H. C. spoke of the remnants of the old Bohemian crowd—expressed contempt for William Winter<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">7</a>
—called him Turvey-drop, &amp;c.—Stoddard, Steadman, Aldrich, Howells, Garrison,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">8</a> 
                &amp;c. were mentioned—there appears to be nothing new to tell about them. Garrison is the man of all work on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nation</span>. Stoddard still has his place in the Custom House. Ada Clare<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">9</a> 
                is an actress—has lately been playing at Memphis, Tenn—is now about playing at Albany—Clapp remains as clerk in the City Hall—Spoke of your pamphlet—says he considers it absolutely one of the most vital productions in Literature. He read it through several times. It seems to have had lasting effect upon him both intellectually &amp; emotionally. Says there is nothing of its special character, ever produced, that is, upon the whole, equal to it. It is peerless. Clapp speaks in a tone of seriousness &amp; deference I never heard him use toward any other work or person<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">10</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Haggerty<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">11</a>—Just at dusk I was up Broadway, waiting for a Fulton ferry stage, when he came down upon me with genuine Irish warmth &amp; volubility—I was glad to see him, &amp; we had a talk of some fifteen minutes there on the street—He too spoke of the pamphlet—he said when he first heard of it he went down to Huntington's<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">12</a> &amp; bought a copy, took it home, &amp; sat down &amp; read it to his wife—when through he read it a second time—&amp; then still a third time. He says he now regularly keeps the pamphlet within reach, &amp; whenever he feels the want of something to rouse him up, &amp; put his mental energies on the alert, he resorts to it.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Mrs. Price—she asked particularly about you—Mrs. Rhinds is unwell, &amp; has been taken home by her sister, to recuperate—John's book<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">13</a> has been largely read—at least by those interested in L. of G. and its virtuous &amp; accomplished author—&amp; has had deepest appreciation &amp; acceptance in good quarters. Show John this letter—I send him my love—William, I have not yet rec'd any letters—when any come, send them to me 1194 Atlantic st. opposite Hamilton st. My sister Mat &amp; her children are here. Farewell.</p>

                    Whitman's letters to the family is extant between the periods of his two visits
                    to Brooklyn in 1867, it is possible to reconstruct the activities of the family
                    from correspondence addressed to him. Jeff was in St. Louis, and Martha and her
                    children boarded with friends in Towanda, Pennsylvania, until they returned to
                    Brooklyn, about the time Whitman was writing. George, not completely recovered
                    from his illness, was working and living with his mother. The family was
                    considering, as Whitman noted, building a home. Charles Heyde, in <a href="duk.00391">June 1867</a>, complained vituperatively of Hannah's
                    vulgarity and meanness, and described an encounter with her which he came out of
                    with "the back of my right hand so badly lacerated by her nails that I am compelld to bandage it." Ed, at least, caused no one any trouble. (Jesse had
                    been confined to an asylum in December of 1864.) </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00267_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00267_n4"><span>

                        by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William published a
                        biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and Francis

                    <p class="tei_p">Henry Clapp (1814–1875) was one of Walt Whitman's intimates from the
                        Pfaffian days. Restless and adventurous, Clapp roamed to Paris, returned in
                        the 1840s to Lynn, Massachusetts, to edit the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Essex County

                        (1858–1860; 1865–1866), he printed <a href="per.00071">"A

                        260–261. "Henry Clapp," Walt Whitman said to Horace Traubel, "stepped
                        out from the crowd of hooters—was my friend: a much needed ally at
                        that time (having a paper of his own) when almost the whole press of America
                        when it mentioned me at all treated me with derision or worse. If you ever
                        write anything about me in which it may be properly alluded to I hope you
                        will say good things about Henry Clapp" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.63.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996], 1:236).
                        In his reply to Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.01812">May 9, 1867</a>,
                        O'Connor was amused that Clapp was "becoming a respectable citizen. When
                        once a man enters upon the downward path, &amp;c.…one can see as the
                        guilty result of Bohemianism, a place in the Common Council or Board of

                    "downward path." Richard Henry Stoddard (1825–1903) was appointed custom
                    inspector in New York through the influence of Nathaniel Hawthorne. From 1860 to

                    Walt Whitman, William W. Thayer wrote: "How's Bohemia and its Queen the charming
                    Ada? She talks with us every week in the Leader in articles that wify and I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">love</span> to read." Her autobiographical
                    novel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Only a Woman's Heart</span> (1866), relates the
                    sufferings of a woman in love with a young actor who becomes famous in the role
                    of Romeo. Except for the contrived romantic conclusion and some melodramatic
                    plotting, the book is an interesting, and occasionally penetrating, study of an
                    Ophelia-like woman (Ada herself). She returned to the stage in 1867–1868.
