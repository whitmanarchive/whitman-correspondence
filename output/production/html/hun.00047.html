                &amp;c)—a book of about 400 pages to sell at $3—The text will be about
                the same as hitherto, occasional slight revisions, simplifications in punctuation
                &amp;c—the main thing a more satisfactory consecutive order—a better <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ensemble</span>, to suit me—some new pieces, perhaps 30

                    the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
                    an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Pilot</span>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
