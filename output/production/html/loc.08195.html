                Am feeling fairly—sweating to-night (tho' it is cold weather dry &amp; clear
                at present)—am a little timid &amp; cautious ab't getting cold, but welcome
                the sweat—the March Lip: will probably have all
                paid for &amp; quite handsomely a page of my poemetta with some prose personal
                memoranda (autobiographic) &amp; a passable picture maybe more stuff (will see how
                the cat jumps)—the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Critic</span> (last next or following
                one) has or will have a little poemet—&amp; the Lord knows what else
                a-coming—have now intervened with a leisurely sitz-bath &amp; foot
                washing—&amp; shall leave a little blank for to-morrow &amp; send off at evn'g
                mail</p>
