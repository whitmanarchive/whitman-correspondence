            <p class="tei_p">Rather an easier day—the Doctor, young Mitchell, has
                call'd— weather pleasant—bowel action very favorably for three
                consecutive days —(no drugs)—Mrs: Stafford visited
                me yesterday, very acceptable— broil'd or stewed chicken yesterday—&amp;
                this morning's breakfast—"Nov: Boughs" has stretch'd to 104 pages
                corrected—If "Elias Hicks" fragments get into a paper it may reach to ab't
                120—remain in good spirits—</p>

                    does fairly—I have rec'd word from Rhys—y'rs of 19th just rec'd—</p>
