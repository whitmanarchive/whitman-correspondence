                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    his regular physician, William Osler, was unavailable. Whitman was not overly
                    impressed with the Mitchells: "The young man Mitchell did not take me by
                    storm—he did not impress me. I start off with a prejudice against doctors
                    anyway. I know J. K.'s father somewhat—Weir: he is of the intellectual
                    type—a scholar, writer, and all that: very good—an adept: very
                    important in his sphere—a little bitter I should say—a little
                    bitter—touched just a touch by the frosts of culture, society,
