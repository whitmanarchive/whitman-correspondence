                    O'Connor. In 1894 she married artist Charles Walter Stetson, soon after his
                    divorce from Channing's lifelong friend, writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman. After
                    her initial refusal to ever read Whitman's work, Channing became enthralled by
                    the poet's words and, in 1887, had the idea of creating an illustrated calendar
                    with excerpts from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. The illustrations
                    would be made by Walter Stetson. The project was never realized. For more on the
