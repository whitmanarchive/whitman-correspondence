                Thank you &amp; Dr. C. &amp; dear Grace &amp; Stedman &amp; all—all the
                movements are certainly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">roseate</span> toward me &amp; I feel
                thankful &amp; responsive—&amp; all the confirmatory possible—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am still kept in my room, hoping each day to get firmer &amp; stronger &amp; get
                out—but no such day comes yet—or even the indication of it—&amp;

                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in copy</span>—The printing office is now all diverged on a
                Harrison and Morton book, hurry is up—will take them a week—my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boughs</span> will be at least two months before
                published—possibly longer—I remain in good spirits—It seems to be grow[ing] hotter &amp; melter—</p>
