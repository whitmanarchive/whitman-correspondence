            <p class="tei_p">Willy Gurd &amp; I went to New York Monday evening [/] put up at Grand Union Hotel 42d Street [/] —I
                saw Johnston next day and lunched with him—they all asked
                most particularly after you. I saw J's new store (Union Square) he seems to be doing
                well but says he needs more capital than he has. We had a long conference with our
                New York lawyer and decided on a line or action in reference to the meter. We left
                N.Y. 6 o'clock last evening and after a very pleasant run of 17 3/4 hours arrived at
                London 11.45 today, 5 minutes (only) late. Find my folk all well and the asylum in
                good shape—a lot of work had accumulated which it will take a few days to wade
                through but that is nothing. As things look now I hope to be down your way again
                early in the summer, meanwhile you must keep me posted as to your health &amp;c
                &amp;c. [—] I find a book (sent for before I left home) [a]waiting me
                here—"The Bacon-Shakspere question answered" by C. Stopes. He /(rather <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">she</span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Charlotte</span> Stopes[)] /believes S. wrote the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">plays</span>—I expect to find the volume interesting and
                will send it to you if you would like to see it as soon as I gave run through it.
                [—] Willy Gurd &amp; myself (though we should have been glad to found a
                company for the manufacture of the meter in Phil<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a</span></span>) are not
                the least discouraged by our failure. We believe more strongly than ever that the
                meter is immensely valuable and that we shall eventually carry our plans
                through—the only subject of regret on my own part / (except regret on
                    Horaces account). /is that I shall not see you as much in
                the immediate future as I had hoped but I trust a few months will make this all
                right—all the folk here were greatly interested to hear from me all about you
                and they were much pleased that I could give so good an account of your health.
                (though certainly you might easily be better than you are).</p>
