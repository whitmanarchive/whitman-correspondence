    <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n2">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00602_n2 note" id="duk.00602_n2"><span><p class="tei_p">This letter dates to
                        between December 20 and December 22, 1870. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
                        letter November 30, 1870 on an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent
                        Collection (not reproduced here). Bucke's month and date are unlikely to be
                        correct because Louisa acknowledges receiving a letter from Walt "this
                        wensday morning the last day of autumn." Bucke's year, 1870, however, is
                        corroborated by other matters in the letter: a visit to Louisa Van Velsor
                        Whitman by Ellen M. O'Connor and her daughter Jean; the presence of Thomas
                        Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's family in St. Louis; Louisa's receipt of copies
                        of the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical</span>, presumably copies with a
                        printing of Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman" from May
                        of that year; and the absence of son George Washington Whitman from Brooklyn
                        with the expectation that he will visit the coming weekend.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In the letter, Louisa writes that "Ellen M. O'Connor "was here yesterday
                        tuesday 2[1?]." Edwin Haviland Miller's date for the letter of December 22,
                        1870 presumably follows from this information (see Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University
                        Press, 1961–77], 2:368). But if the year is 1870, Louisa's phrase to
                        describe the day on which she wrote as "wensday last day of autumn" does not
                        correspond with the fact that the last day of autumn fell on Tuesday,
                        December 20 (Wednesday, December 21, 1870 being the first day or winter). As
                        no date in December 1870 can be consistent both with Wednesday and with the
                        "last day of autumn," it is likely that either her reference to the day of
                        the week or to the last day of autumn is incorrect. The presumed date for
                        the letter is the Wednesday morning that fell closest to the winter
                        solstice, December 21, 1870. Another detail that supports the week before
                        Christmas as the probable date is Louisa's expectation that George, who did
                        not visit on Thanksgiving, is expected in Brooklyn on Saturday, Christmas
                        Eve. The reference to the last day of autumn and the expectation that George
                        will visit on Christmas support the week before Christmas in 1870 as the
                        date of this letter. The most probable day of writing is Wednesday, December
                        21, with the assumption that Louisa is mistaken on the intersection of
                        season designation and the solstice. But given the inconsistency between
                        calendar date and solstice, the letter can only be assigned a range from
                        December 20 to December 22, 1870.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    regularly consulted almanacs, so she may be invoking the date in a strict sense.
                    The winter solstice, traditionally the first day of winter, fell in the early
                    morning on December 21, 1870, a Wednesday. Tuesday, December 20, 1870 was the
                    last day of autumn, and Wednesday was the first day of winter. She may,
                    technically, be writing early Wednesday morning before the exact hour and minute
                    of the solstice and so be writing on a Wednesday but still during autumn because
                    preceding the winter solstice, but that seems unlikely as she tended to rise
                    early. The winter solstice fell December 21, 1870 at 1:42 am (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Political Manual and Annual Register for the State of New Hampshire</span>

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    (1830–1910) was the wife of William D. O'Connor. Nelly O'Connor, whose
                    marital strife with William had led to a separation in 1870 and resulted in
                    divorce, wrote an admiring letter to Walt Whitman from Providence, Rhode Island,
                    shortly before this visit to Brooklyn (see Nelly's <a href="loc.01815">November 20, 1870</a> letter to Walt; and see Florence B. Freedman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Douglas O'Connor: Walt Whitman's Chosen Knight</span>
                    [Athens: Ohio University Press, 1985], 246). For a time Walt Whitman lived with
                    the O'Connors, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be
                    his close associates during the early Washington years. The correspondence
                    between Walt Whitman and Nelly is almost as voluminous as the poet's
                    correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the

                    above) in the year 1870 was Tuesday, December 20. If the letter refers to the
                    change of seasons at the winter solstice, "1" is the most probable
                    number. </span></span> [<a href="#r20">back</a>]</li><li id="n15">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00602_n15 note" id="duk.00602_n15"><span>Walt Whitman dined

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
