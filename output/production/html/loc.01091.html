            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">This letter is to give you love and greeting from an English Socialist and his wife.
                We heard a little while ago that you were seriously ill, but hope you are now much
                better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Forgive all that is amiss in the enclosed papers, and look on them as the first
                efforts of a child to speak words he can already understand. What we want to tell
                you is, that here in old England, in the midst of infidelity and sentimental
                pessimism, your strong and beautiful thought has found its way <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01091.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01091.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01091.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> into the hearts and lives of two
                lovers, making them wiser and happier in every way. We are no longer ashamed of
                ourselves, but accept life as we find it. Acknowledging ourselves your disciples, we
                take you at your word as you have given it to us in your books, and believe that you
                will welcome us into your personal confidence and love. We should like to know that
                you feel this and accept it, and should infinitely treasure even a single line from
                your hand in return; but if you are ill, or feel it anyhow a burden, do not trouble
                about it, for we shall not fear you have forgotten us.</p>

                thanks would best please you if shown in trying to help others in the same way. This
                we do, and promise still to do; so wherever you are you will know that here your
                spirit is at work. We have a brother in the States, and long to visit them
                ourselves: can it be that we shall ever have the joy of meeting you face to
                face?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With our truest love and thanks, and prayers for your joy and health</p>
