            <p class="tei_p">You can hardly imagine what pleasure it gave me to see your bold strong hand again on
                a letter, you look as well as ever in that address, &amp; it is such a satisfaction
                to know you are really better. I believe now you will come out of this crisis as
                you have <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01163.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01163.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01163.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> out of
                so many others &amp; be yourself again. It is too bad that you have to be cooped up
                in that way. If you could only get up strength of body &amp; will to get out!
                What do you eat? I have made the discovery that raw clams are very
                strengthening &amp; that the juice is a tonic, but I need not tell an old Long
                Islander like you the virtue there is in clams. I eat them from the shell without
                any seasoning. Try some. This cool weather I know you enjoy.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01163.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01163.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01163.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> It sounded so good to hear you
                speak of its raining. It is dry as a bone here, no rain for many weeks, my potato
                crop is cut short 50 per cent, &amp; all my young vines &amp; plants are suffering
                much. Indeed we have had no rain to speak of since the great snow storm in March. I
                hope O'C. is really mending. If he comes to Camden let me know &amp; I will
                come down too &amp; see him. I try to keep absorbed in my farm operations. It is
                much better for me than to mope about nibbling at literature.

                water again this summer or early fall, &amp; I do so hope you will be well enough to
                join me. I know the sight of the sea would give you a lift. We are all well. My
                regards to Horace Traubel. Tell me something about him when you
                write again. I am very anxious to see <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">November Boughs</span> I do
