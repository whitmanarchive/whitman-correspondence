                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    granite tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of Philadelphia built the
                    tomb, at a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs with
                    money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a
                    summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor,

                    he also wanted to be able to present copies to his friends. A version of the
                    1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, often referred to as the
                    "deathbed edition," was bound in December of 1891 so that Whitman could give the
                    volume to friends at Christmas. The following year, the 1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Phildelphia publisher
                    David McKay. This volume reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex consisted of a long prefatory essay
                    entitled "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" and sixty-five poems; while the
                    second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection of thirty-one short poems taken
                    from the gathering of prose and poetry published under that title by McKay in
                    1891. For more information on this volume of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>, see

                    Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would never

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891
