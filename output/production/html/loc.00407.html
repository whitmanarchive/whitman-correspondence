               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The two books you sent me (also one to Mr Lane)<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> came all right. I am extremely obliged to you for it all and shall, Oliver Twist like, ask for more.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I should dearly love to get together a set of the Pacific R. R. Explorations and Reports and intend to do so. I hope you will be able to send me some of the other Vols. I told you that I had written to Boston for a Report on the Hoosac Tunnel,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> that also has come and I have already found it of great use to me in solving two or three questions that I was not up in. I believe that the best information about Engn'ring is to be got out of reports of this character. I shall, as you suggest keep a sharp lookout for Vol. 12<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> and shall buy it if I come across it. If you, in looking around the second hand book stalls, see any Engnring works please write me what they are and the price. I am very much in want of a copy of "Wisbachs Mechanics"<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> but cannot meet with it in New York. I have been quite disappointed in not getting a letter from you to-day. I certainly thought I should. I sent you a letter on Tuesday last with the $10 from Van Anden<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> and a letter from Han and one from George also a long one from me—6<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">cts</span> worth—I hope you received it  The things by Express came all right. George's bundle was 6/ and the last $1.00. Hattie has got entirely over her fall<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> and is as healthy as a child can be, she is growing finely. I am sure twould please you to see her, she is as smart as can be, talks perfectly plain, without the least babyishness. Just below us in the same street there is a young lady from down east, she comes in to see Mat every day or two. she talks in the down east fashion, saying "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cant</span>" as if it was made of rrs. the other day she said so before sis. Sissy says "Why dont you say <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cant</span>, thats no way to talk, ca<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">r</span>nt" which quite took our young lady aback. And yesterday one of the Hearkness<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> children was in our rooms and they were talking about rolling their hoops. one told sis—4½ yrs old—that she had rolled her hoop down the "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">teet</span>"  sis says "I rolled mine down <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the street</span>  thats the way to say it"<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>  She often wonders when you are coming home to take her out and show her the ships and steamboats. Mat is first rate and well, she has no work and consequently is living quite like a Christian. we often talk about you and wonder how you are getting along  Mat often speaks about how she should have felt if she had gone with you. How much better it was that she did not, wasnt it.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> Mother is quite well and a little worried about not hearing from you and George  I feel quite concerned about Andrew  I have had Ruggles<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> see him twice now  Ruggles says that he has a bad, very bad throat and about the only thing that will cure him will be his going away from the coast back in the interior somewhere  He says that it is hardly possible to give any medicine for such a complaint and the more one takes the worse he is off. However he says if Andrew takes the right care of himself he may recover here.<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a> I wish he could get something to do away from here, back in the interior. I have great faith in that for diseases of the kind like his. I will write you every day or two and keep you posted how he is. I should be glad to have you give the Capt Mullen<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">13</a> you spoke of a letter to Mr Lane, very glad indeed. I like to become acquainted with such men, It is education to me and I find I am in need of a great quantity of that article. by all means, if he has not left, give him a letter to Mr Lane. Well Walt, I will, after wishing you pleasure and success, bid you good night</p>

                    of the Pacific Railroad reports (see Jeff's letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00404">April 2, 1863</a>). Moses Lane (1823–1882) served
                    as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
                    designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
                    engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money from his employees and friends to give
                    to Walt's hospital efforts during the Civil War. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27, 1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month.
                    Similarly, Lane sent dollar contributions from six individuals on <a href="loc.00411">May 2, 1863</a>. In an unpublished manuscript in the
                    Berg Collection, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
                    quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
                    Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
                    there.)" Lane also assisted Whitman in other ways. He was so solicitous of
                    Whitman's personal welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>,
                    he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00407_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00407_n2"><span>See Jeff's <a href="loc.00400">March 3, 1863</a>, letter to Walt. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00407_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00407_n3"><span>It is not known which

                    "was real amused with sis's remarks," he warned the family that "it is not good

                    Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
                    especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
                    practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
                    (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New

                    show no signs of resenting this instruction. Walt seems to have been able to
                    combine the roles of the prophetic, all-knowing poet and the dominant, wise
                    family head. </span></span> [<a href="#r12">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">13. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00407_n13 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00407_n13"><span>Captain John Mullan
                    (1830–1909), an army engineer, had just published for the U.S.
                    Topographical Bureau his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Report on the Construction of a
                        Military Road From Fort Walla-Walla to Fort Benton</span> (Washington, D.C.:
                    Government Publications Office, 1863). Because Jeff and Walt were both fascinatd
                    by the prospect of a western railroad, they would have admired Mullan's work
                    described in Volume XII of the Pacific Railroad reports (see note 4 above). In
                    his letter to his mother from <a href="loc.00765">March 31, 1863</a>, Walt
                    had praised "Capt. Mullin, U.S. Army (engineer), who has been six years out in
                    the Rocky Mt's, making a gov't road, 650 miles from Ft. Benton to Walla
                    Walla—very, very interesting to know such men intimately, and talk freely
                    with them." Apparently Jeff wanted Walt to write a letter to Mr. Lane concerning
                    Captain Mullan (see also Jeff's letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00409">April 20, 1863</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li></ul>
