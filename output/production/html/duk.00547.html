                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    more tenuous in 1869 after the reorganization of the Brooklyn Board of Water
                    Commissioners in April: Lane resigned after the new board was seated (see Louisa

                        Whitman the previous month had reported his regular visits to the O'Connors,

                        during the Washington years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was
                        the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                        relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                        almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. Jenny was
                        the O'Connors' daughter. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
