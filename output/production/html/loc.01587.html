                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend Harry Hurt,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I thought I would just drop you a line for yourself—but no doubt you keep 
                fully posted about me by my letters to Pete, as I am willing you or 
                any of my particular friends who wish to, should read them. 
                (He knows who I would be willing should read them—I leave it to him)—Harry, you would much enjoy going round N. Y. with me, if it were possible, 
                &amp; then how much I should like having you with me. This great city, 
                with all its crowds, &amp; splendor, &amp; Broadway fashion, &amp; women, &amp; amusements, 
                &amp; the river &amp; bay, &amp; shipping, &amp; the many magnificent new buildings, 
                &amp; Central Park &amp; 5th Avenue, &amp; the endless processions of private vehicles 
                &amp; the finest teams I ever saw, for miles long of a fine afternoon—altogether they make up a show that I can richly spend a month in enjoying—for a change from my Washington life. I sometimes think I am the particular 
                man who enjoys the show of all these things in N. Y. more than any other mortal—as if it was all got up just for me to observe &amp; study. Harry, 
                I wish when you see Ben. Thompson, conductor, you would say I sent 
                him my love, &amp; have not forgot him. Let him read this letter. I send 
                him a newspaper, the N. Y. Clipper. I have marked the piece about the 
                Five Points. I went down there myself just for fun, three nights ago, 
                with a friend of mine, a policeman, &amp; that account in the Clipper is a very good 
                description—only not half rank enough. I wish you to tell John Towers, conductor, 
                I sent him my love, &amp; we will see each other again one of these days. I send him 
                a Clipper also with an acc't of the Five Points—Harry, you let one of them 
                lend you the paper, &amp; read the acc't—it will amuse you—I was there two hours—it was instructive but disgusting—I saw one of the handsomest white girls 
                there I ever saw, only about 18—blacks &amp; white are all intermingled—</p>
