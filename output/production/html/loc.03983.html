            <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write a few lines to you and let you know how I am. I cannot get you off my mind somehow. I heard something that made me feel bad, and I saw that you did not want to bid me good bye when you went away yesterday. I will tell you what it was. I heard that you was going to Washington and stay and be gon <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">fore​ </span><span class="tei_corr">for​

            anything to me about it. I think of it all the time, I cannot get my mind on my work the best I can do. I should like to come up to Camden next week, and stay all night with you if I could, but I suppose I can not do it. I wish you would write to me soon and let me know how you are. Things are <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">verry​ </span><span class="tei_corr">very​
