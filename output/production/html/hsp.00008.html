            <p class="tei_p">Would the enclosed be considered opportune—&amp; of use to you for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Citizen</span>? 
                As it has been printed before, it would <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> be proper to put 
                "For <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Citizen</span>" over it—but just print it plainly. Of course it is gratuitous—&amp; I accompany it with best respects to yourself. I have not forgotten 
                your kind invitations to furnish an original piece for the paper—&amp; hope one day to have something which will be suitable. 
                I am writing very little lately. Should you print the piece, 
                I wish you to do me the favor to send ten copies by mail to my address here.
