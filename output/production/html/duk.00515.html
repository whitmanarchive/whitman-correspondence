                    February 23, 1869. In the body of the letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman said she
                    wrote on Wednesday. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 25, 1868,
                    but his date must be ruled out. Bucke's year "1868" may be a slip of the pen
                    both because February 25, 1868 fell on Tuesday and because another February 25
                    letter dates near the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 (see
                    Louisa's <a href="duk.00517">February 25, 1868</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver dated this letter a year later,
                    "February? 1869," and Edwin Haviland Miller reported their date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman
                        and His Family</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949],
                    199–200; Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The letter informs Walt
                    about his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's difficulties with the rising
                    river in St. Louis, and Louisa probably relied on a letter from Martha Mitchell
                    "Mattie" Whitman that survives only as an undated fragment. Randall H. Waldron
                    dated Mattie's letter fragment to February 1869 on the basis of Gohdes and
                    Silver's date for this Louisa Van Velsor Whitman letter (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1977], 67, 67, n. 1). The year 1869 is certain, but the range
                    of possible dates in February can be narrowed to the latter part of month based
                    on Louisa's remarks on the transition between the presidential administrations
                    of Andrew Johnson and Ulysses S. Grant, which draw from her reading of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>. The letter dates to February 23,
                    1869, when a rumor first circulated that Edwards Pierrepont could be appointed
                    as the attorney general under incoming president Ulysses S. Grant. Another
                    remark on political news, on Andrew Johnson's pardon of John C. Devlin, probably
                    comes from an article that appeared a week before the Pierrepont rumor surfaced.
                    Louisa's remarks on political events seldom come more than a week after they are
                    reported in the newspaper. In addition, another extant letter from Louisa to
                    Walt dates to <a href="duk.00575">March 4, 1869</a>, and it is highly
                    unlikely that this letter was written only one day after that one. Therefore,
                    the date of the initial Pierrepont article, February 23, 1869 (Wednesday), is
                    certain as this letter's date. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00425_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
                    Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
                    Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
                    his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
                    continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
                    death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
                    Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
                    you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
                    1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see

                    two years imprisonment in February 1868 on the charge of running an unlicensed
                    whiskey ring (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, February 5, 1868, 3).
                    Outgoing President Andrew Johnson pardoned Devlin on February 16, 1869. The
                    Devlin pardon was politically inflammatory because a Brooklyn Collector of
                    Revenue, T. C. Callicott, was held to be party to Devlin's effort to defraud the
                    government, though only John Devlin was convicted. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span> editorialized in favor of Johnson's pardon, minimized the
                    suggestion of corruption, and implied that Benjamin F. Tracy, District Attorney
                    for Kings County, New York, had overreached on a petty case ("Devlin's
                    Pardon—A Query for District Attorney Tracy," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn
                        Daily Eagle</span>, February 17, 1869, 2). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman read
                    against the grain of the Democratic-leaning <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eagle</span>'s
                    editorial slant. She had indicated her skepticism toward the politics of the

                    followed the potential appointments for attorney general closely because Walt
                    Whitman was serving as a clerk in that office. Edwards Pierrepont
                    (1817–1892) actively supported Republican candidate for president Ulysses
                    S. Grant, and Pierrepont was rumored to be under consideration for appointment
                    as attorney general ("Topics of To-day," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily
                        Eagle</span>, February 23, 1869, 3). Grant, upon taking office, passed over
                    Pierrepont for that office and instead appointed him the United States attorney
                    for the southern district of New York (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>,
                    April 28, 1869, 7). Pierrepont eventually joined Grant's cabinet as attorney
                    general, but not until 1875 (Bruce Tap, "Pierrepont, Edwards," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American National Biography Online</span>). </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00422_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00422_n2"><span>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.

                    mark to separate this paragraph from next, a short vertical slash or solidus, is
                    on the next line, and the mark might be considered to enclose the next phrase,
                    to precede the word "give." Louisa's mark most often resembles in shape a
                    closing parenthesis mark. The mark has been transcribed, here as elsewhere, as a
                    closing parenthesis, with no paired opening parenthesis. The choice of the
                    closing parenthesis to represent Louisa's mark is to signal that the grammatical
                    function for the mark is generally to close the previous phrase. Nonetheless,
                    the range of styles for the mark are diverse, from marks that more closely
                    resemble a vertical pipe to those that more closely resemble a comma. A vertical
                    pipe is also a reasonable transcription for this mark. </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">11. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00470_n8 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00470_n8"><span>For a time Walt Whitman
                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
