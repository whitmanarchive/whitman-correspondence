            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new—Am pretty well but have the grip again &amp; sore throat &amp;
                swell'd head—but ate my breakfast &amp; got out last evn'g in wheel chair
                &amp; might be (&amp; doubtless shall be) much worse—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I send what I have just scratch'd off ab't the Hollandisk piece (I believe that's ab't the best word to nip &amp; print
                &amp; stick to)—It is quite a theme—quite significant—means a good
                deal to me &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">for me</span>—hope <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the mood</span> will get hold of you one of these times soon—have just
                heard from Dr B[ucke], all well—I am sitting here as
                usual in my den—fine sunshiny day &amp; cool enough—</p>

                    good name—Of course rambly &amp; careless—like y'r little Quaker
                        piece—not thinking of getting it all in by
                    a long shot—but a few little hints &amp; seed-facts of the Matter—</p>
