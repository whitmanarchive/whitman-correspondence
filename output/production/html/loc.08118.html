                and note what you say re constipation. Do you ever take any Friedrichshall water
                now? I wish you would get some and take a wine glass or more in a tumbler of hot
                water first thing in the morning 2 or 3 times a week—I think you would find
                benefit from it. Thanks for the papers and especially for the "Personal memoranda"
                proof which I like well. Here there is nothing but politics, the main quetsion in
                the context being: Shall we or not have closer trade relations with the U.S.? It
                seems a funny thing to dispute over. It is as if Michican or New York should argue:

                at home (in Mich or N.Y.) and in that way increase the population and prosperity of
                the said Mich. or N.Y.? How very singular such a debate would sound and yet it would
                be no different from the present one except that here we have a tariff and want to
                get rid of it. Then (the funniest thing of all) many of our people dread closer
                relations with the U.S. for fear of moral contamination! A sort of—"I thank
                thee oh God that I am not like this publican," business. Or as the Scotchman prayed:
