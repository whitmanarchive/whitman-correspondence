                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    John H. Johnston, the New York Jeweler, visited Whitman on November 2, at which
                    time the poet paid Sidney Morse, presumably for one of his busts, "30 &amp;
                    10-$40" (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
                    On November 15 Walt Whitman noted receipt of ten dollars from Johnston "(wh' I
                    paid to M) (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On August 27, Whitman gave Morse
                    $70 "to pay to caster for the 10 heads" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Morse
                    brought four of the heads on September 2, one of which was sent to Richard
                    Maurice Bucke (Commonplace Book). On November 12, 1887, Conway proposed taking
                    Whitman to visit Robert Pearsall Smith in Philadelphia for a few days, an
                    invitation which he declined (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00092_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00092_n2"><span>The Fujiyama porcelain

                    many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
