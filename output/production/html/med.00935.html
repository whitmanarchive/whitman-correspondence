            <p class="tei_p">above find receipt for the money—&amp; thanks 
                to you. Give my respects to Miss Wixon—I 
                am sometimes very ill for days &amp; cannot read,
                write, or talk or be talked to—&amp; on such occasions answer no letters. . . . am sitting here 
                in my den in great old ratan chair (with big wolf skin 
                spread over back) sunny but pretty cold—have a good oak wood fire.</p>
