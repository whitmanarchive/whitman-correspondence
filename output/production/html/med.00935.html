                    (1816–1900) was born in Ayr, Scotland, and immigrated with his family to
                    the United States as a small child. After working as a grocer for several years
                    in Fall River, Massachusetts, Robert and his brother John opened a stationery
                    shop and bookbindery. Prior to the abolition of slavery, Adams aided runaway
                    slaves along the Underground Railroad between Massachusetts and Rhode Island.
                    Adams's obituary includes a statement from Frederick Douglass in which he
                    described Adams as "the first man to recognize me as a man." It also notes his
                    friendships with John Greenleaf Whittier, William Lloyd Garrison, and other
                    well-known abolitionists ("Deaths of Robert Adams and Ransom P. Baker,"<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fall River Daily Evening News</span> [April 3, 1900], 8). The
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fall River Daily Evening News</span> of November 1, 1890,
                    also records that Adams visited Whitman at his home in Camden "a few days ago"
                    and "arranged for the sale of copies of Whitman's works," adding that Adams
                    found the poet "feeble and unable to hold a long conference" ("Personal"
                    [November 1, 1890], 8). For more information on Adams and abolitionism, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Anti-Slavery Days in Fall River and the Operation of the
