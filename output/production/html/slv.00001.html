                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Comrade B O'D (&amp; all the friends)</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Y'r good long varied &amp; loving letter came yesterday &amp; has been welcome &amp; nourishing to me—Sure 
                I read ab't that Australian "interior" bit, and "shearing"—&amp; ab't the experience &amp; death of Gordon 
                the poet—&amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the whole letter</span>—with much I will 
                not particularize—with deepest interest, &amp; thank you for sending it to me &amp; hope for more—&amp; 
                can almost see you all there, &amp; w'd wish to specifically send remembrance &amp; love to you, Fred Woods, Jim 
                Hartigan, Ada, Eve, Mr: and Mrs: 
                Fryer, Ted, Louie, "Tom Touchstone" (when there,) &amp; 
                any other friends not named—the 'cute &amp; loving appreciation of my book &amp; me by them there in Australia 
                has gone right to my heart—is far more than literary or technical fame.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have sent you a copy of Dr Bucke's book by mail—if I repeat parrot–like you must 
                pardon—for one thing I forget &amp; for another I am not certain former letters by P O get there, sent yesterday 
                same address as this—(it will interest you all but it is over color'd flattered)—Dr B is well &amp; is 
                busy—is a leading personal friend &amp; my chief literary advocate—full of work &amp; responsibility in 
                London, Ontario, Canada—has a large family of sons &amp; daughters—I keep pretty well, eat &amp; sleep 
                middling well, (eat bread &amp; honey, blackberries &amp;c this summer weather—occasionally a mutton chop)—my 
                worldly circumstances are good enough for me on a very low plane of course—I have a good strong tight cane chair 
                &amp; get out in it almost every day—propell'd by my stout young man nurse—an 
                hour last evn'g at sunset down by riverside (the Delaware)—keep in fair spirits &amp; in good flesh but no more 
                bodily volition or locomotive power than a log—can't get across the room—I am still sitting here at this 
                moment in a big cane chair—pleasant weather, open window (have had it very hot here)—Farewell for the present</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">God bless you &amp; all—it is so welcome to me to be loved by you all but I know I am overestimated</span>
