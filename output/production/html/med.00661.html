                    expenses, paid the Staffords when he stayed at their farm, so it is possible
                    that Harry decided to reciprocate on a recent occasion when he visited Whitman

                    to make frequent visits to the home of Robert Pearsall Smith and Hannah Whitall
                    Smith in Germantown; their daughter, Mary Whitall Smith, had admired Whitman's
                    work during her studies at Smith College and talked her father into taking her
                    to Camden to meet the poet. Whitman became good friends with this wealthy Quaker
                    family and stayed with them from August 4–28 (a little over three weeks,
                    not the "five or six weeks" he claims in the letter). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00661_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwqr note" id="med.00661_n3"><span>Glendale is near Kirkwood,
                    New Jersey. At various times, Whitman and the Stafford family seem to refer to
                    the contiguous communities of Kirkwood and Glendale interchangeably, as if
                    Kirkwood were part of the larger community of Glendale. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00661_n4 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwqr note" id="med.00661_n4"><span>Montgomery ("Mont")
