                    did not explain to Walt Whitman the reasons that could delay her trip to
                    Burlington, but her phrases "if nothing occurs" and "if nothing prevents" may
                    reflect considerable tension with her son Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. In
                    his <a href="loc.00440">July 16, 1865</a> letter, Jeff reported to Walt
                    that Hannah Heyde and her husband Charles L. Heyde had quarreled about "some
                    women that Heyde had in his room" and that Louisa had told Jeff that she
                    intended to "bring Han home," a suggestion that Jeff ridiculed. He insisted that
                    his mother's visit to Hannah be delayed until George could accompany her, but
                    Jeff eventually reconciled himself to the visit (see his <a href="loc.00441">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt). The relationship between Hannah
                    and Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter, was difficult. Heyde
                    was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
                    Hannah. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00439_n13 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00439_n13"><span>Troy is located just north

                    to Burlington (see her <a href="duk.00440">September 5, 1865</a> letter to

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. George
                    was available to accompany Louisa on her trip because he had just begun his
                    post-war housebuilding business. According to Louisa's <a href="duk.00438">August 8, 1865</a> letter, after being mustered out of the army George
                    considered journey work (day labor) and starting his own business. Thomas
                    Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman recommended the latter but may have encouraged his own
                    supervisor Moses Lane to offer George a position with the Brooklyn Water Works
                    (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00441">September 11, 1865</a> letter to Walt).
                    George in July began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith
                    and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
                    inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. During the war, he was wounded in the
                    First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the
                    Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). For more information on George, see

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his

                    Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
                    some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
                    Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
                    (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22, 1870</a> letter to Walt).

                    Whitman to his mother is extant. Both the presswork in Peter Eckler's printing
                    of Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> (1865) and the press coverage of
                    James Harlan's late-June 1865 dismissal of Whitman from the Department of the
