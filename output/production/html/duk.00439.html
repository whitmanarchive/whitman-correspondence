            <p class="tei_p">i have not gone to
                burlington yet
                but if nothing occurs i shall
                go next monday i have not felt able to
                go through the hot weather but as it is cooler
                now i think i can stand it
                i wish Walter you
                would write to hanna and tell her i will
                come on monday next if nothing prevents  
                George thinks he will go as far as troy
                and then come for me when i return)
                which
                will be before very long george will go
                to mrs hegamens
                to board and edd will
                stay here martha has very much to
                doo she has been foolish enoughf to take
                2 or 300 dozens of shirt fronts and she cant
                get them stichedstitched every girl is full of work
                so she and jeff has set up every night till
                midnight to work i think she will be
                perfectly satisfied when she gets this lot
                done to not take any more sis almost
                lives down here, she thinks very much
                of orgee as she calls her unkle george
                i suppose you got Jeffs letter saying
                about George wanting to get in the
                custom house he would like to get in
                i suppose very much
                he and A man
                by the name of smith has been talking
                of buying some lots and building A shop
                and 2 houses but he says that would
                not prevent him from going in the
                custom house if he could get the appointement

                to feel as if he ought to be
                earning something i dont ask for but
                very little but he would give me if
                i asked for it i know. but i thing he
                wants to doo something with what money
                there is) of course you know Walt i wouldent
                make any fuss about it he has earned it
                hard and it rightly belongs to him and
                if he can doo better with taking i would rather
                he would if i only had some place to
                live i am very tired of living here it
                is very disagreable in many ways
                Georg
                thinks maybee we can get some small
                house but rents is so very high well
                i gess i wont worry i dont believe
                i shall ever want i hope you will
                keep well walt i was glad to hear you
                boarded with mrs gra<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium">c</span>on i should think
                it would be much better) i have fixed
                up georges room and put a carpet in
                so he can take his friends up when he has
                them come) i want you Walt to send
                me a little change this week as you have
                done heretofore and when i get to
                hans
                i wish you would send me five
                or six dollars at different times about two
                dollars at a time i may want to get some
                little things for her i believe i have
                said all i want too i have heard
                nothing from poor Jess and as to
                Andrews
                children Jimmy brings them up here
                sometimes
                poor little objects of misery
                they live i give them things when
                they come
