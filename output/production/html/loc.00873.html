         <p class="tei_p">The undersigned<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> though a comparative stranger to you feels himself drawn toward you closer and closer after perusing your "Leaves of Grass."  We have a sympathy in common with you. in some of these well wrought passages the experiences taught there has been one to some extent.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">While doing garrison duty with my regiment the 2nd New York Arty on the works South of the Potomac I visited Washington in company with a comrade named Charles String of Connecticut and by him introduced to you at your studio. (I forget the street) but it was not far removed from the avenue. if I mistake not, you accompanied us to the theatre at night. I have never forgotten you since, remembering you as a friend to the Union and the "boys" striving to keep it together. I left the regiment in the trenches in front of Petersburgh, my term of Service having expired, after three years Service from Oct 1861.  on arriving at Washington I tried to find you but could not.  when you first met me, on leaving you you gave me a small book of poems with your name in it, bidding me think of you.  I stowed it away in my knapsack but loosing that I lost your gift.  I would like a duplicate, if it is not presuming too much.  I trust you will not think me forward in this.  With many and kind regards</p>

                    have been a patient at Armory Square Hospital between 1862 and 1863, also wrote
                    to Whitman on July 22, 1869: "You will not remember the writer of this
                    letter....I won't forget Walt Whitman. I have just read that you completed your
                    half century. May you live to a ripe old age, loving and beloved. I was reading
                    'Drum Taps' last night, no man can depict Army life so vividly that had not
                    spent his time amongst the boys" (Yale). </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
