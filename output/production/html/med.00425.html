      <p class="tei_p">The bad spells in my head continued at short intervals all through Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> 
        Today there is a sulking sort of lull—have not had any actual blurs, but all the while 
        ready to have them, and pretty sick and sore and bad, especially in head, confusing me, 
        and affecting my eyes. I have rewritten my Will, with some slight changes and additions, 
        and placed it in the pocket of my trunk here.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> … Ate my breakfast like a man this morning. I don't go out any.

      <p class="tei_p">. . . Charley, I think I fully appreciate my situation and the possibilities and contingencies—and honestly think yet I shall come round—that this is a pretty bad flurry, but one which will pass over. . . .

                    The Evangelical Alliance, an international meeting of Protestants who sought
                    unity among all Christians, met in New York from October 3–10, 1873. It
                    convened to answer the questions raised by the new Catholic doctrines of papal
                    infallibility and the immaculate conception of the Virgin, as well as the
                    threats posed to Christianity by science and materialism. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, with unconcealed Protestant zeal, reprinted verbatim
                    virtually all the speeches of the delegates. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
