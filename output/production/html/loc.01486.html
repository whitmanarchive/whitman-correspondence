                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Sir,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wished to send you a copy of the July No of the Westminster Review containing an
                article by me which attempts a study of one side of your work in literature. I wrote
                to Mr. W. M. Rossetti to enquire for your address &amp; he tells me that he has
                already forwarded a copy to you. But I will not be defrauded by Mr. Rossetti of the
                pleasure I had promised 
                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01486.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01486.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01486.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                myself &amp; therefore you must accept a second copy of the Review (which I post
                with this letter) &amp; do what you like with it.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I ought to say that the article expresses very partially the impression which your
                writings have made on me. It keeps, as is obvious, at a single point of view &amp;
                regards only what becomes visible from that point. But also I wrote more cooly than I
                feel because I wanted those, who being ignorant of your writings are perhaps
                prejudiced against them, to say "Here is a cool, judicious, impartial 
                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01486.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01486.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01486.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                critic who finds a
                great deal in Whitman—perhaps, after all, we are mistaken." Perhaps this will
                be unsatisfactory to you, &amp; you would prefer that your critic should let the
                full force of your writings appear in his criticism, &amp; attract those who are to
                be attracted, &amp; repel those who are to be repelled, &amp; you may value the
                power of repulsion as well as that of attraction. But so many persons capable of
                loving your work, by some mischance or miscarriage or by some ignorance or removable
                error fail in their approach to you, or do not approach at all.

            <p class="tei_p">You have many readers in Ireland, &amp; those who read do not feel a qualified
                delight in your poems—do not love them by degree, but with an absolute, a
                personal love. We none of us question that yours is the clearest, &amp; sweetest,
                &amp; fullest American voice. We grant as true all that you claim for yourself. And
                you gain steadily among us new readers &amp; lovers.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">If you care at all for what I have written it would certainly be a pleasure to hear
                this from yourself. If you do not care for it you will know

                We have lately had a good public lecture in Dublin from a Fellow of Trinity College
                on your poems—R. Y. Tyrrell a man who knows Greek poetry very well, &amp; who
                finds it does not interfere with his regard for yours. If the lecture should at any
