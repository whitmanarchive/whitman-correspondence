               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came safe, and was very welcome, &amp; always will be—Mother, I am sorry about your rheumatism—If it still continues, I think it would be well for me to write a line to Mrs. Piercy,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> &amp; get Jeff to stop with it, so that you could take the baths again, as I am sure they are very beneficial—Dear mother, you write me, or Jeff must in the next letter, how you are getting along, whether it is any better, or worse—I want to know.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, about George's fund in the bank, I hope by all means you can scratch along so as to leave $250 there—I am so anxious that our family should have a little ranch, even if it is the meanest kind, off somewhere that you can call your own, &amp; that would do for Ed, &amp;c.—it might be a real dependence, &amp; comfort—and may-be for George as much as any one. I mean to come home one of these days, and get the acre or ½ acre somewhere out in some by-place on Long Island, &amp; build it, you see if I dont. About Hannah,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> dear mother, I hardly know what advice to give you—from what I know at present, I cant tell what course to pursue. I want Han to come home, from the bottom of my heart. Then there are other thoughts &amp; considerations that come up. Dear mother, I cannot advise, but shall acquiesce in any thing that is settled upon, &amp; try to help.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The condition of things here in the Hospitals is getting pretty bad—the wounded from the battles around Fredericksburgh are coming up in large numbers.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> It is very sad to see them. I have written to Mr. Lane, asking him to get his friends to forward me what they think proper—but somehow I feel delicate about sending such requests, after all.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have almost made up my mind to do what I can personally, &amp; not seek assistance from others.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Mother, I have not received any letter from George. I write to him &amp; send papers to Winchester. Mother, while I have been writing this, a very large number of southern prisoners, I should think 1000 at least, has past up Pennsylvania avenue, under a strong guard. I went out in the street, close to them, to look at them. Poor fellows, many of them mere lads—it brought the tears, they seemed our own flesh &amp; blood too, some wounded, all miserable in clothing, all in dirt &amp; tatters—many of them fine young men. Mother, I cannot tell you how I feel to see these prisoners marched [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">incomplete</span>]</p>

                    the letter that I sent you. I suppose she is about the same. Mother speaks of
                    sending for her &amp;c and then says she hardly knows what to do. Tis rather a

                    before long. It certainly is a great relief not to be cursed with letters from

                    is not known. Lane (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn
                    Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee
                    Water Works and served there as city engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money
                    from his employees and friends to give to Walt's hospital efforts during the
                    Civil War. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27, 1863</a>, Lane
                    pledged $5 each month. Similarly, Lane sent dollar contributions from six
                    individuals on <a href="loc.00411">May 2, 1863</a>. In an unpublished
                    manuscript in the Berg Collection, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I
                    have distributed quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by
                    noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief
                    Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane also assisted Whitman in other ways. He was
                    so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial
                    benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
