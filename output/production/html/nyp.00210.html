            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome. I will leave out "orgies" since you dislike it so much. I have been much delayed in the printing—but I believe they have now fairly got to work, &amp; will go on expeditiously. I found a printer, Chapin,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> 24 Beekman st., who was getting new type of the kind I wanted, &amp; I waited for him—He engages to have the composition &amp; presswork done in from two to three weeks. It will be typographically about the same as Drum-Taps, only about five times as thick—Upon calling on Huntington &amp; Son,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I found that Drum-Taps has sold somewhat better than I anticipated—I was treated very courteously, &amp; they promised to advertise D. T. &amp; push it this fall—I did not say any thing about the coming new Leaves—but may propose to Messrs. H. to be the agents before I return—I shall probably return about the 12th of September—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I arrived here, I found my mother &amp; the rest lately moved (again) in a large old house out in Brooklyn suburbs, &amp; in a good deal of confusion &amp;c.—Mother was not well, &amp; seemed generally fagged out—But since then things have come round somewhat—Mother has improved a good deal—yesterday felt quite like herself again—I spend three or four hours there every day—Jeff is very well, &amp; George pretty well—in the latter I can see that campaigning &amp; Danville prison have left their mark<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—I am stopping at Mrs. Price's, am most pleasantly situated in personal comforts, &amp;c.—Mrs. P. has asked much about you—hopes to see you yet—The weather here is really perfect—I have been to the Central Park, had a long ride &amp; foot ramble—the place is probably looking its best just now—I go out on Broadway occasionally &amp; take a walk, or a ride on the omnibus—I am received by the drivers with renewed rapture—it is more marked than ever.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I havn't learned any thing worth mentioning about literary persons or doings here. I doubt whether the article will be accepted in the Galaxy<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—don't know who edits it—I send my love to John Burroughs<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—Also the same to Charles Eldridge<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>—I hope to be able to write to Nelly<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>—I wish you when you write to say I send my love to her. And now for a while, my dear friend, Farewell.</p>

                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
                    Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
                    intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
                    clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
                    however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more

                    written on May 31, 1866: "he has got to be very economical, very different from
                    when he was in the army, but every body changes, some for the better and some
                    for the worser" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
                    Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). She also had noted that "he
                    appears to be very much taken with some one," and, on June 7, 1866, "i think
                    george will get married" (Trent Collection). George, however, did not marry
                    until 1871. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00210_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00210_n6"><span>
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Galaxy</span> was edited by W. C. and F. P. Church; see the

                    1:335–336). When W. C. Church wrote on June 13 to O'Connor (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection), requesting an article, he suggested that the magazine
                    publish Burroughs's "Walt Whitman and His 'Drum-Taps,'" which appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Galaxy</span>, 2 (<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00061.html">December 1, 1866</a>), 606–615. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00210_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00210_n7"><span>John Burroughs
                    (1837-1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, DC, in 1864, even though
                    Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently defended
                    Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
                    commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
                    was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
                    men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
                    write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as
                        Poet and Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896),
                    and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting the Universe</span> (1924). For more information

Eldridge was
                    one half of the Boston based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
                    who put out the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In
                    December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
                    Virginia, Walt Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had
                    become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a
                    desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For
                    more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde [1829&#x96;1896] and Charles W. Eldridge

                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
                    would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth Amendment, which
                    Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in
                    response William established a separate residence. The correspondence between
                    Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with
                    William. </span></span> [<a href="#r9">back</a>]</li></ul>
