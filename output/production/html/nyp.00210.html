               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came safe, &amp; was indeed welcome. I will leave out "orgies" since you dislike it so much. I have been much delayed in the printing—but I believe they have now fairly got to work, &amp; will go on expeditiously. I found a printer, Chapin, 24 Beekman st., who was getting new type of the kind I wanted, &amp; I waited for him—He engages to have the composition &amp; presswork done in from two to three weeks. It will be typographically about the same as Drum-Taps, only about five times as thick—Upon calling on Huntington &amp; Son, I found that Drum-Taps has sold somewhat better than I anticipated—I was treated very courteously, &amp; they promised to advertise D. T. &amp; push it this fall—I did not say any thing about the coming new Leaves—but may propose to Messrs. H. to be the agents before I return—I shall probably return about the 12th of September—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When I arrived here, I found my mother &amp; the rest lately moved (again) in a large old house out in Brooklyn suburbs, &amp; in a good deal of confusion &amp;c.—Mother was not well, &amp; seemed generally fagged out—But since then things have come round somewhat—Mother has improved a good deal—yesterday felt quite like herself again—I spend three or four hours there every day—Jeff is very well, &amp; George pretty well—in the latter I can see that campaigning &amp; Danville prison have left their mark—I am stopping at Mrs. Price's, am most pleasantly situated in personal comforts, &amp;c.—Mrs. P. has asked much about you—hopes to see you yet—The weather here is really perfect—I have been to the Central Park, had a long ride &amp; foot ramble—the place is probably looking its best just now—I go out on Broadway occasionally &amp; take a walk, or a ride on the omnibus—I am received by the drivers with renewed rapture—it is more marked than ever.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I havn't learned any thing worth mentioning about literary persons or doings here. I doubt whether the article will be accepted in the Galaxy—don't know who edits it—I send my love to John Burroughs—Also the same to Charles Eldridge—I hope to be able to write to Nelly—I wish you when you write to say I send my love to her. And now for a while, my dear friend, Farewell.</p>
