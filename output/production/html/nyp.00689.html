            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 16th rec'd. Also Kennedy's card the day before—thanks for both.
                Nothing notable with me—still sort o' moping.—I am sitting here in the little front room—it is snowing roundly outside &amp;
                wind east—Just got a letter from Morse—he seems to be all right—he
                is in Richmond Indiana yet—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am not doing any thing particular—idly eking out the time—I send some
                letters that have come &amp; the "Preface" proof—but not papers or
                books—cold, cold here—</p>
