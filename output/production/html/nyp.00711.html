                the turn of it reminds me of William &amp; the days that are
                gone—We are of course more whetted than ever to have the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">full book</span> 
                fr'm H M &amp; Co:—Is it yet in abeyance?—And you,
                &amp; how are you getting along? Nicely I hope.—H T is
                going over his L S books &amp; more &amp; more impress'd with the
                sketches—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had a bad winter &amp; have yet—grip, catarrh of bowels, bladder trouble
                &amp;c: &amp;c:—have not been outdoors for ten weeks—but sit up here
                &amp; read &amp; write much of the time—but fearful inertia &amp; loss of

                putting it through slowly—Should not get along with it or anything without
                Horace Traubel—comes every day, &amp; is invaluable—Dr B is still 
                the same in London Canada—I believe expects to
                come this way (&amp; to Washington) in three weeks—Fine sunny day as I
                write—had my breakfast, a rare fried egg, Graham wet toast &amp;
                coffee—my supper at 5—no dinner—pretty fair spirits—often
                think of you there &amp; the former times—Write when you can.</p>
