Probably this letter was written to one of the New Englanders who contributed funds for Walt Whitman's hospital activities. The descriptions resemble those in two letters written in 1863; see Whitman's letters from August 6, 1863
                   and  October 1, 1863

I always carry a stout double-pocket haversack, filled with things—also large pockets in my coat &amp;c—I have articles of many kinds, I have learnt what is appropriate—I generally carry a bottle of wine—I buy oranges by the box, &amp; fill my pockets with them before going into a ward, they are very refreshing to feverish men this weather—I have nice preserved peaches or something of the jelly sort—to many I give little sums of money—the soldiers very largely come up here without one cent—every day I find cases proper for small gifts of money, &amp; where it is indeed more blest to give, than the good it can do them. (You hear north there quite too much of the rum drinking, rowdyism &amp;c. &amp; thieving of the soldiers—in general, that is confined to the foreign regiments, &amp; I must say to the Philadelphia &amp; N. Y. City regiments—the soldiers from the States, from the country, especially the West &amp; from New England and the country parts of N. Y. &amp; Penn, are noblest specimens of young men, well brought up, intelligent, singularly free from intemperance &amp;c—you ought to see them as I have for the last five months.)<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a>
