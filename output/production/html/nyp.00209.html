            <p class="tei_p">I got your letter of last Thursday—I wrote to Han<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> two or three days ago—poor Mrs. Mix<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is very bad—she has her old complaint neuralgia—she suffers very much indeed—it makes me almost sick, some spells she has, the agony is terrible, &amp; her screams are heartrending—fortunately her nights are comparatively easy—it is doubtful if she recovers—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are having delightful weather—just right—I went to the Post Hospital<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> yesterday, Sunday, &amp; who do you think was one of the first persons I found there—Jo. Velsor,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> poor fellow, he has had jaundice pretty bad, but is now getting very near well—so he goes out &amp; around—he expects to go to work again in a day or two—he has work in the Quartermasters Dept. driving an ambulance—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I suppose you got the letter Saturday last with the envelopes—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you have as pleasant weather in Brooklyn as we have had here for a week past, &amp; now—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is generally expected Congress will adjourn the last of this month, &amp; then there will be some high old times in politics &amp; the Departments—most of us think that A[ndrew] J[ohnson] is only waiting for that, to lay around him &amp; kick up his heels at a great rate. Well, we shall see what comes to pass—but I guess the Republicans are just every bit as ferocious as he is—they won't back down an inch—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, the small bills I send you, you might distribute, (or get some fire crackers or something,) for Ed,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> &amp; Jimmy &amp; George<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—not forgetting Hat &amp; sis<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—</p>
