            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got your letter of last Thursday—I wrote to Han two or three days ago—poor Mrs. Mix is very bad—she has her old complaint neuralgia—she suffers very much indeed—it makes me almost sick, some spells she has, the agony is terrible, &amp; her screams are heartrending—fortunately her nights are comparatively easy—it is doubtful if she recovers—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are having delightful weather—just right—I went to the Post Hospital yesterday, Sunday, &amp; who do you think was one of the first persons I found there—Jo. Velsor, poor fellow, he has had jaundice pretty bad, but is now getting very near well—so he goes out &amp; around—he expects to go to work again in a day or two—he has work in the Quartermasters Dept. driving an ambulance—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I suppose you got the letter Saturday last with the envelopes—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you have as pleasant weather in Brooklyn as we have had here for a week past, &amp; now—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is generally expected Congress will adjourn the last of this month, &amp; then there will be some high old times in politics &amp; the Departments—most of us think that A[ndrew] J[ohnson] is only waiting for that, to lay around him &amp; kick up his heels at a great rate. Well, we shall see what comes to pass—but I guess the Republicans are just every bit as ferocious as he is—they won't back down an inch—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, the small bills I send you, you might distribute, (or get some fire crackers or something,) for Ed, &amp; Jimmy &amp; George—not forgetting Hat &amp; sis—</p>
