            <p class="tei_p">Rec'd yours to-day—Sorry you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">didnt​ </span><span class="tei_corr">didn't​
        
      </span></span> get the letter sent that day I met you, as I
                wanted you to have it particular—but perhaps it
                has come to hand—that it went to Berlin p. o. I have no doubt, as I mailed it
                myself, addressed it to you "care of Sheriff Gibbs" same
                as this envelope—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hear Ed has sold the nag, &amp; gone off to seek his fortune, newspaper canvassing
                    &amp;c.—Whether he will make much money or
                not, I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> know, but I feel sure he will learn a good deal &amp; get experience of
                the world &amp; people, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of himself</span> too—all of
                which is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">wisdom</span> described in scripture as better than
                riches—rec'd a long letter from Herbert Gilchrist, to-day—he seems to be well, &amp; working away hard at
                his painting—he describes to me some of his new pictures—says his mother
                was temporarily quite unwell, when he wrote—Edward Carpenter was visiting
                them—has a big beard—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new with me—I keep well as usual—you say when I have a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">blue spell</span> I must write to you—I don't have any such
                spells—&amp; seems to me it is time you grew out of them—my theory is
                that it is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">onesself​ </span><span class="tei_corr">one's self​
        
      </span></span></span> and not from outside circumstances one
                suffers such unhappy hours—the more one yields to them the frequenter &amp;
                stronger they get until at last they take complete possession of a
                fellow—Harry dear, you are a good wrestler—see if you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">cant​ </span><span class="tei_corr">can't​
        
      </span></span> <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">throw them</span> &amp; keep 'em thrown—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I ought to write you something cheerful—I have been in all day—quite
                a deep snow &amp; the wind blowing—I here in my big rocking chair at a job
                writing—Oscar Wilde sent me his picture yesterday, a photo a foot &amp; a half
                long, nearly full length, very good—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As this letter has little or nothing in it I suppose it will be sure to reach you
                &amp; not miss—like the other I wanted you to get—</p>
