                    were father and son, both artists. In a notation late in 1880 Whitman referred
                    to Percy, "age 16, a student, intends to be an artist . . . Academy of Fine
                    Arts" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
                    of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On
                    December 21, 1881, Percy made several pencil sketches of Whitman, and in his
                    letter to his grandmother, Elisa S. Leggett, on December 25, he drew a sketch
                    for her of the picture which was "in a promising condition" (Detroit Public
                    Library). His oil painting of Whitman is now in the Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection. See also Mrs. Leggett's letter to Whitman on <a href="man.00038">July 19, 1880</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
