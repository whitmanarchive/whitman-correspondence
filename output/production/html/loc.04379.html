                <span class="tei_salute">My dear, dear friend</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is now Sunday evening—8-15—Dr Bucke &amp; I 
                have recently finished supper, &amp; I think I will write you a few lines.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A beautiful day, clear, with warm sunshine. This morning I attended chapel—tallying 
                in my own experience your "Sunday with the Insane"—sat afterwards
                for an hour and a half on a bench in the grounds here scribbling—the 
                sun shining warmly, crickets shrilling, the lawn, flower beds &amp; 
                trees (some changing colour)
                beautiful in the sunshine.—In the afternoon
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00898_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00898_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00898_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                I attended the Catholic service—At 5 oclock D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> took
                me for a drive to town &amp; round the country near. 
                Enjoyed it immensely. Quite struck by the general air of comfort &amp; 
                prosperity—the neat houses with grounds or 
                garden attached, the elbow room &amp; air space enjoyed by each—the 
                total absence of the overcrowding, smoke, dirt, &amp; foul air with which I am familiar. 
                The country—fertile &amp; beautiful—has not the mellow 
                domesticated character of English landscape, but retains a suspicion of wildness 
                &amp; unreclaimed Nature still. But, at every turn, it has its 
                own changeful beauty, &amp; always suggests freedom, expansion, 
                healthful conditions, &amp; room for growth.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A beautiful &amp; typical September evening, mellow &amp; golden, but with a cool 
                air &amp; a steely zenith that made it bracing &amp; stimulating. 
                The moon shining down added to its beauty.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall not soon forget our ride, &amp; our talks of you.—I  
                find, as I expected to find, that Dr Bucke grows upon me
                with further knowledge of him &amp; is a worthy friend of yours.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had quite a talk yesterday afternoon with M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Bucke—about 
                the D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> &amp; about your visit here 11 years ago. It seems that I occupy your room! Am not I a proud man?
                It gives an additional interest to the view from my window to know that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> used to admire it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I write this in the Library—Dr B sitting to the right 
                reading—Pardee on the other side of the table. 
                Dr shewed me a short time ago two books on Egypt that you used to read.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By the way, M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Bucke told me a short time ago that 
                Rev<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> Richardson is coming here on Tuesday, &amp; I
                hope to get him to talk a little about you.—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">This afternoon I read an article on Carlyle by 
                Thoreau, &amp; one sentence hit me rather hard. 
                T. said that many people went to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">see</span> 
                Carlyle who were not worthy to be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">seen</span> by him. 
                "That's <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span>" In writing to you, &amp; in coming to see you, 
                I feel that I am not worthy of so great &amp; dear a privilege. 
                But it is said that "love is a present for a mighty King," &amp; 
                I suppose it is for a mighty poet too. And you have my love for ever, &amp;
                more so as I know you better. And behind mine is the love of fellows who are 
                affectionate &amp; true &amp; good. Love &amp; honour to you from us all.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">My letters from home contain such sentences as these. 
                "If you dare, give Walt's hand a grip for my wife &amp; me" 
                (Wentworth Dixon.) 
                "I would very much like you to give him <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my</span> love," 
                (R K Greenhalgh). 
                "Please give my love &amp; best wishes to Walt Whitman" (W.A. Ferguson)</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I have had 2 or 3 drives with Dr B. round the extensive grounds here.—Acres 
                &amp; acres of vegetables &amp; fruits in first rate condition. 
                Everything excellently arranged &amp; carried out.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Have spent some time too in his office—looking over his collection of books &amp;c, 
                &amp; his series of photos of you. All intensely interesting to 
                me—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">too</span> interesting indeed, for it
                affects my sleep.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is a great &amp; wonderful privilege to me to be here in many ways, 
                &amp; I am thankful to Dr Bucke for his kindness &amp; to God for his mercy.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I won't write any more now. With love to you, which only grows more tender, 
                &amp; with love to M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Davis 
                &amp; Warry, &amp; to Traubel.
