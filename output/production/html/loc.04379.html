                have recently finished supper, &amp; I think I will write you a few lines.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A beautiful day, clear, with warm sunshine. This morning I attended chapel—tallying 
                in my own experience your "Sunday with the Insane"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a>—sat afterwards
                for an hour and a half on a bench in the grounds here scribbling—the 
                sun shining warmly, crickets shrilling, the lawn, flower beds &amp; 
                trees (some changing colour)
                beautiful in the sunshine.—In the afternoon

                me for a drive to town &amp; round the country near. 
                Enjoyed it immensely. Quite struck by the general air of comfort &amp; 
                prosperity—the neat houses with grounds or 
                garden attached, the elbow room &amp; air space enjoyed by each—the 
                total absence of the overcrowding, smoke, dirt, &amp; foul air with which I am familiar. 
                The country—fertile &amp; beautiful—has not the mellow 
                domesticated character of English landscape, but retains a suspicion of wildness 
                &amp; unreclaimed Nature still. But, at every turn, it has its 
                own changeful beauty, &amp; always suggests freedom, expansion, 
                healthful conditions, &amp; room for growth.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A beautiful &amp; typical September evening, mellow &amp; golden, but with a cool 
                air &amp; a steely zenith that made it bracing &amp; stimulating. 
                The moon shining down added to its beauty.</p>

                    by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had recently
                    returned from two months of travel in Europe, where he had spent time with
                    Johnston, Wallace, and the Bolton College group of English Whitman admirers.
                    Both Bucke and Wallace visited Whitman in Camden, and, after spending a few days
                    with the poet, Wallace returned with Bucke to London, Ontario, Canada, where he
                    met Bucke's family and friends. Wallace's account of his time with Whitman was

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
