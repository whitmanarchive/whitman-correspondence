                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Forman,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter &amp; the fine poem of "the Great Peace-Maker" have been <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  by me, &amp; read with pleasure.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> With regard to re-printing my book
                in full in England<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I can only say that of course it would be gratifying to me—But I should like to
                be informed in advance of any thing pending that way, as I should like to make one
                or two suggestions before the book is begun. A preface or introduction mainly of
                statistical nature (about the book &amp; myself) including a brief syllabus of the
                plan &amp; idea of "Leaves of Grass" from its own point of view—would be
                judicious—but I don't think favorably of a literary criticism for
                preface—</p>
 
            <p class="tei_p">I have an Edition (the sixth)<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> just out—edition
                1872—in some respects probably the best—Sampson Low, and Trübner have copies of it.—It looks just now as though some form
                of international copyright might be legalized here—If so, this might be worth
                considering in reference to the reprint of my book in England.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a></p>

                either of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="February​ ">Feb.</span>​  or March, I am not certain which, I understand it has a criticism on my
                book, from a believer.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> I am here on a
                visit, &amp; return to Washington in a few days.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> I shall always be happy to hear
                from you. My address is Solicitor's Office, Treasury, Washington,
