                    18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a
                    relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by early Whitman scholarship,
                    in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in the first six volumes of
                    Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>—though
                    it does appear frequently in the last three volumes, which were published only
                    in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son"
                    (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H.
                    Johnston), but the relationship between the two also had a romantic, erotic
                    charge to it. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Garland Publishing, 1998). Eva M. Westcott (1857–1939) was a teacher in
                    New Jersey. She married Harry Lamb Stafford on June 25, 1883, and together they
                    had three children. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n3">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.04005_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.04005_n3"><span>Glendale, New Jersey, was
