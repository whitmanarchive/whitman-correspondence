                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Rudolf Schmidt,</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have rec'd yours of April 25. Having an opportunity by Mr. Clausen, who is journeying home to Denmark, I send you some books—another copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—and a copy for Björnsen—(though he may not read English, I have wished to send him something—&amp; when he chances upon someone who reads English and Danish, I should be so glad to be communicated to him.)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Your article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ide</span> will soon be translated for me in full.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> It is pronounced magnificent by those who can read it. I shall have much to say about it in my next.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I send you two or three humorous American works. The subject of American humor is very difficult to treat fully &amp; satisfactorily, even for a native. In the books I send, the great difficulty will be the slang, the American local idioms, &amp; the mis-spelling—all of which will certainly prove <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">chevaux-de-frise</span> making it impossible for any foreigner to penetrate the fun of them—Still I have thought it worth while to send them as (much more than the comic &amp; pictorial papers) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">idiomatic, native specimens</span>, (as minerals or insects)—<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">American humor is yet in its nebulous state—unformed—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">struggling to be born</span>. Some traits already appear—it is very grim, loves exaggeration, &amp; has a certain tartness &amp; even fierceness—I will endeavor to gather something more for you on this business—&amp; write you again—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am going soon to a College about 500 miles from here to deliver a commencement poem<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a>—it will be published, forming part of a little book—which I will send you—During June I shall be home with my mother in Brooklyn, N.Y.—then return again here—</p>

                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">For Idé og Virkelighed</span>, wrote to Walt Whitman on
                    October 19, 1871: "I intend to write an article about yourself and your writings
                    in the above named periodical which is very much read in all the Scandinavian
                    countries. . . . I therefore take the liberty to ask you, if you should not be
                    willing to afford some new communications of yourself and your poetry to this
                    purpose" (Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_rlc.00005_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="rlc.00005_n2"><span>
                    <p class="tei_p">Carl F. Clausen, whom Schmidt termed "my old friend and countryman,"
                        corresponded with Schmidt after he left Denmark in 1860; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Orbis Litterarum</span>, 7 (1949), 34–39. The city
                        directory in 1870 listed him as a draughtsman and in 1872 as a patent agent.
                        He died of consumption in the middle 1870s; see Thomas Biggs Harned

                    <p class="tei_p">Björnstjerne Björnson (1832–1910), Norwegian poet, dramatist,
                        and novelist, was co-editor of Schmidt's journal. In his letter of <a href="syr.00004">January 5, 1872</a>, Schmidt observed: "Hans
                        Christian Andersen would perhaps not make you very great joy, if you did
                        know him personally. Björnson would be your man." Schmidt later altered
                        his opinion of Björnson; see notes to Whitman's <a href="rlc.00003">March 19, 1874</a> letter to Schmidt.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_rlc.00005_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="rlc.00005_n4"><span>Schmidt's review of
                    Whitman appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">For Idé og Virkelighed</span> in March
                    1872. Whitman included excerpts from it in an appendix to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">As a
                        Strong Bird on Pinions Free</span> (1872), 7–8. It was reprinted in

I
                    should like to write an article on 'American fancy' contrasting the grotesque
                    humor that is scattered with no pretension in your newspapers with the humor of
                    Luther and Shakespeare . . . . Could you not find for me about a dozen jokes of
                    this sort." It is not known what books Whitman sent to Schmidt. See also

                    Dartmouth College on June 26, 1872. Evidently, a student organization hoped to
                    annoy the faculty by inviting Whitman to Dartmouth, a seat of New England
