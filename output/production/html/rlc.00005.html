                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Rudolf Schmidt,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have rec'd yours of April 25. Having an opportunity by Mr. Clausen, who is journeying home to Denmark, I send you some books—another copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>—and a copy for Björnsen—(though he may not read English, I have wished to send him something—&amp; when he chances upon someone who reads English and Danish, I should be so glad to be communicated to him.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Your article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ide</span> will soon be translated for me in full. It is pronounced magnificent by those who can read it. I shall have much to say about it in my next.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I send you two or three humorous American works. The subject of American humor is very difficult to treat fully &amp; satisfactorily, even for a native. In the books I send, the great difficulty will be the slang, the American local idioms, &amp; the mis-spelling—all of which will certainly prove <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">chevaux-de-frise</span> making it impossible for any foreigner to penetrate the fun of them—Still I have thought it worth while to send them as (much more than the comic &amp; pictorial papers) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">idiomatic, native specimens</span>, (as minerals or insects)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">American humor is yet in its nebulous state—unformed—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">struggling to be born</span>. Some traits already appear—it is very grim, loves exaggeration, &amp; has a certain tartness &amp; even fierceness—I will endeavor to gather something more for you on this business—&amp; write you again—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am going soon to a College about 500 miles from here to deliver a commencement poem—it will be published, forming part of a little book—which I will send you—During June I shall be home with my mother in Brooklyn, N.Y.—then return again here—</p>
