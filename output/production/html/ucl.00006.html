               Am getting along ab't as usual—Some nice oysters (with a bit of
               lemon) for my breakfast—cloudy &amp; wet inclined to chilly to-day
               here—was out in wheel-chair last even'g—I enclose my Preface note
               ab't O'Connor for the new book of his tales—written
                off hand—Col: Ingersoll is to speak anent of L of G &amp;c. in Phila.
                probably last part of coming month, (the piece in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Trans[cript]</span>
                rec'd—thanks)—sold a big book yesterday—have just lit a little fire
               in my stove—
