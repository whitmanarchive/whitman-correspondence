            <p class="tei_p">I return Mr Johnson's letter—I do not see any thing in it
                more than facts or appearances warrant—as he is &amp; as things are down there
                poor J is in a bad, unhappy fix—as of coffee being ground in a mill—Much
                relieved to know you will <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">yourself</span> see all the proofs of
                the Wilson book—give them a good searching reading—for with Dr
                Bucke's book they are to be in all probability the vignette
                &amp; authority of many things in my &amp; my works' future—the backward &amp;
                contemporary reference. Nothing new in particular with me—more or less
                evidences of gradual physical deterioration—but
                spirits good—appetite &amp;c fair—&amp; you know I begin my 70th year
                now in ab't two months—thank God indeed that things are as well as they are
                &amp; that I &amp; my fortunes (literary &amp; otherwise) are—Rainy &amp; dark
                &amp; raw here all day—I was out yesterday four hours to my friends the
                Harneds—was taken &amp; bro't back in my
                phæton—a lull in my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> contributions—I
                send you the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kottabos</span> from
                Dublin—Morse is still out in Indiana—Dr B
                kindly writes to me often &amp; you must do so too.</p>
