                            5, 1871</a>, and read what he called his "American Institute piece"
                        (in his <a href="loc.01699">September 17,1871</a> letter to the
                        Roberts Brothers) before the American Institute on September 7, 1871. The
                        poem was published as "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00005.html">After All, Not to Create Only</a>," and was retitled "Song of the
                        Exposition" for its publication in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span>
                        (1876).</p> The newspaper coverage of Walt Whitman's appearance at the American Institute was extensive: the
                        Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Morning Chronicle</span> published the
                        poet's account on September 7, 1871; the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening
                            Post</span> reprinted the poem, and called Walt Whitman "a good
                        elocutionist." He was also praised in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> and the Brooklyn <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Standard</span>; the New York
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> printed excerpts from the poem on
                        September 8, 1871, and later a devastating parody by Bayard Taylor
                        (reprinted in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Echo Club</span> [2nd ed., 1876],
                        169–170); the Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> published
                        the poem on September 9, 1871. In reply to the criticisms of the poem, Walt
                        Whitman prepared the following for submission to an unidentified newspaper:
                        "The N. Y. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World's</span> frantic, feeble, fuddled articles
                        on it are curiosities. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Telegram</span> dryly calls it
                        the longest conundrum ever yet given to the public" (Yale). See also Horace
