                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    was a close acquaintance of Walt Whitman and one of the poet's literary

                    daily beginning in the late 1880s. The result of these meetings—during which
                    Traubel took meticulous notes—is the nine-volume collection <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/index.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span>. Later in life, Traubel also

                    after he claimed to have seen a vision of Whitman beckoning him to 'Come on'.

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    and was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization whose socialist
                    politics and working-class ideals were often informed by Whitman's work. A
                    painter and scholar of Shakespeare, he was also a lively debater. With James W.
