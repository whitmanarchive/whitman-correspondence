            <p class="tei_p">I have watched and waited for some friendly line from you, for about one month yet
                not a line have you pened. I suppose you have forgotten your rural friend, in the
                bustle and fashion of Boston life. I don't blame you very much; yet it seems
                to me that you would occasionally think of the loving times we have had in days gone
                by. I notice that is the way you always use me,
                but I will get square with you when I go off on my lecturing trip, not a line will I write you, and
                    <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> you forget it. Here I have been waiting in this dry and
                dusty office for some account of you and your happy <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nnk">trip</span>, and this is the way you
                serve me is it. Well I have a new

                little thing she is too; just such a one as you would like, and I know if you were
                to see those pretty rosy lips you would be charmed beyond measure with them, yet you
                shan't see her now that you used me so. She is a wild rose, plucked from the

                forest, pure as a lily, and gentle as the summer breezes.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother is unwell and
                has been for some time, she has to work too hard I think: she has tryed to get some one to help her but it seems that she dont <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_medium">succeed</span>
                very well. Hope she will be able to have some one ere long. Aunt Lizzie has been to see us twice since
                you were here, and is coming down to stay three or four days next week. Would like you
                to see her, think you would like her. Father is well as usual, and so we all are
                with the exception of mother. Hoping to see or hear from you soon. I am yours as
                ever,</p>
