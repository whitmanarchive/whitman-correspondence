            <p class="tei_p">Still down sick—it holds on day &amp; night—(well have they call'd it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the grip</span>)—I am sitting in my chair to write this, but I
                feel more like lying down, &amp; shall presently do so—I am quite sure nothing
                serious or at all alarming—will probably blow over this coming week—No I
                do not know either the origin nor purpose of the McDermot piece nor do I care a straw—I have sent you Dr Brinton's
                fine monograph ab't Bruno—(if you want one or two
                more I can send them)—We are having quite a clientage among scientists &amp;
                doctors—a while ago it was actors &amp; artists—Could not eat any
                breakfast—drank a cup of near-hot milk—shall try to take a bowl of
                chicken &amp; rice soup at 4—pretty dismal with me—Warren is very good &amp; kind &amp; so Mrs: D[avis]—Of course the massages are given up for the
                present—two days ago (f'm weather &amp; other reasons)—I sweat freely,
                &amp; was better offer—but these two current days are cold—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">near 3 P M—have been lying down—up to finish this &amp; send it
                off—weak &amp; miserable &amp; phlegm-suffocated to an extreme—O the
                beautiful bright clean sunshiny day &amp; the young ones out in their pretty
                clothes—</p>
