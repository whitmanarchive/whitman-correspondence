        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Charley,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter came last week, enclosing one from the office. I have just written 
        to the Postmaster at Washington, asking him to forward my letters here, 
        as I suppose that can be done. How is it? Can it be done—do you know? 
        So you are to leave Washington on Thursday next—&amp; Nelly and Jeannie are also—for a New England visit—May it be a pleasant &amp; healthful &amp; happy one for all of you.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">In my case there is no notable amendment—&amp; not much change—I have irregular spells 
        of serious distress, pain &amp;c. in the head, full as bad as ever, sometimes lasting all day, 
        &amp; sometimes part of the day or night only, with intervals in which, (while I remain still,) 
        I feel comparatively easy—but my locomotion is about as bad as it was—last evening I thought it worse than usual—(to-day it is not)—I am not taking any medicine, nor have I talked with any doctor since I left W[ashington]—nights &amp; sleep are quite good—appetite middling—&amp;c &amp;c.—I still stay here, 
        afraid to go to Atlantic City, or any where, while I am liable every day 
        to these depressing spells—&amp; incapacitated from walking—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">We have the weather in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">streaks</span> of hot &amp; cool here—last evening it turned coldish 
        &amp; remains so this forenoon, very bright &amp; pleasant—but we had it very hot here too, some days—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">By what I see in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Phil. Ledger</span> and N. Y. Herald Wash[ington] items to-day, I infer that William has rec'd 
        the appointment of C[hief] C[lerk] at which I am <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">truly pleased</span>—Nelly, 
        as I suppose you will see this letter, I will send you my love in it, 
        and you must take this letter the same as if written to you—I wontwon't ask you to write from W. at present in the midst of your preparations—but write me from Newport, after you get well rested &amp; settled—did you see Dr. Drinkard? &amp; did he say any thing new about my sickness or symptoms?
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have rec'd a letter from John Burroughs to-day—he &amp; wife are evidently having real good 
        healthy country times away there in the cool uplands of Delaware county—he is home—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am feeling comparatively comfortable to-day, &amp; still hope for the best—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">but</span>—Charley, 
        go in to my office a moment, before you go &amp; see if any letters—tell me if William is 
        definitely appointed—write very soon from Boston, if not before.
      </p>
