                    Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
                    with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New

                    30 fell on a Wednesday in 1869. The year is also consistent both with her recent
                    move to the house that her son George Washington Whitman had provided at 71

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
