            <p class="tei_p">i will only write a
                very few lines this time i receeved your
            letter to day wensdayi withe the contents all
            safe and i have been down to the post
            office and got the order changed it come
            good as we had got rather run ashore
            but walter dear i had enoughf to get
            along i dont know how i should get
            on without you walt but i suppose
            there would be some way they dont
            think that i have no way but what is
            given to me i suppose george thinks
            he finds me a house for his part
            well its good and i am thankfull
                as we have never or not late year<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">s</span>
            been fixed so nicely but at the
            same time we must have something else
            i have stood the hot weather pretty
            well it has been very warm indeed
            here and every where i suppose) i have
            had my face swelled and red and
            pricked so i dident know what
            to doo it is bloated some yet but
                dont feel such a heat as <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">i</span> 
            have i
            think it must be the heat because i
            havent been out in the sun so its not
                that) i have had a letter from  jeffy
                and one from matty since i last wrote
            to you they both come emty but i
            suppose they have ways for all they
            have dont think i suppose matty says
                she is certainly coming on here this fall
            they have got intimately acquainted with
            a railroad agent so they think they can
            come free</p>
