            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am sincerely obliged to you for your letter of August 19.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> It is a great relief to me to know so clearly &amp;
                precisely what you feel about the question I raised. Your phrases "gratuitous &amp;
                quite at the time undreamed &amp; unrecked possibility of morbid
                inferences—which are disavowed by me &amp; seem damnable," set the matter as
                straight as can be, base this doctrine of Calamus upon a foundation of granite.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am not surprised; for this indeed is what I understood to be your meaning, since I
                have studied Leaves of Grass in the right way—interpreting each part by
                reference to the whole &amp; in the spirit of the whole. The result of this study
                was that the "adhesiveness" of comradeship had no interblending with the
                "amativemess" of sexual love.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Yet you must not think that the "morbid inferences," which to you "seem damnable,"
                are quite "gratuitous" or outside of the range of possibility. Frankly speaking, the
                emotional language of Calamus is such as hitherto has not been used in the modern
                world about the relation between friends. For a student of ancient literature it
                presents a singular analogue to the early Greek<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00354.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00354.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00354.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00354.jpg</span> enthusiasm of comradeship in
                arms—as that appeared among the Dorian tribes, &amp; made a chivalry for
                prehistoric Hellas. And you know what singluar anomalies were connected with this
                lofty sentiment in the historic period of Greek development.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Again, you cannot be ignorant that a certain percentage (small but appreciable) of
                male beings are always born into the world, whose sexual instincts are what the
                Germans call "inverted". During the last 25 years much attention, in France,
                Germany, Austria &amp; Italy, has been directed to the psychology &amp; pathology of
                these abnormal persons. In 1889 the Penal Code of Italy was altered by the erasion
                of their eccentricities from the list of crimes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Looking then to the lessons of the past in ancient Greece, where a heroic chivalry
                of comradeship grew intertwined with moral abominations (I speak as a modern man),
                &amp; also to the Contemporary problem offered by the class of persons I have
                mentioned—who will certainly have somehow to be dealt with in the light of
                science, since the eyes of science have been<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00355.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00355.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00355.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00355.jpg</span> drawn towards them: looking, I say, to
                both these things, it became of the utmost importance to know for certain what you
                thought about those "morbid inferences". For you have announced clearly that a great
                spiritual factor lies latent in Comradeship, ready to leap forth &amp; to take a
                prominent part in the energy of the human race. It is, I repeat, essential that the
                interpreters of your prophecy should be able to speak authoritatively &amp;
                decisively about their Master's <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Stimmung</span>, his radical
                instinct with regard to the emotional &amp; moral quality of the comradeship he
                announces.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am sorry to have annoyed you with this discussion. But you will see, I hope now,
                that it was not wholly unnecessary or unprofitable.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> With the explanation you have placed in my hands, in which you give me liberty to
                use, I can speak with no uncertain voice, &amp; with no dread lest the enemy should
                blaspheme.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The conclusion reached is, to my mind, in every way satisfactory. I am so profoundly
                convinced that you are right in all you say about the great good which is to be
                expected from Comradeship as you conceive it, &amp; as alone it can be a salutary<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00356.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00356.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00356.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00356.jpg</span> human bond, that the
                power of repudiating those "morbid inferences" authoritatively—should they
                ever be made seriously or uttered openly, either by your detractors or by the
                partizans of some vicious crankiness—sets me quite at ease as to my own
                course.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I will tell my bookseller in London to send you a copy of the "Contemporary" in
                which there is an essay by me on the "Dantesque &amp; Platonic Ideals of Love." You
                will see something there about the Dorian Chivalry of Comradeship to w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">h</span>. I have alluded in this letter. It seems to me, I
                confess, still doubtful whether (human nature being what it is) we can expect wholly
                to eliminate some sensual alloy from any emotions which are raised to a very high
                pitch of passionate intensity. But the moralizing of the emotions must be left to
                social feeling &amp; opinion in general, &amp; ultimately to the individual
                conscience.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I am greatly interested in your "Rejoinder"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> (w<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">h</span>. by the
                way has been reprinted in the PMG). Anything you say about the inception &amp;
                performance of your great life-work has value.—I have been ill; six days in
                bed with high fever, a lung-inflammation serious to me; only just up again for a few
                hours.</p>

                        <a href="loc.02142">August 19</a>: "Ab't the questions on Calamus
                    pieces &amp;c: they quite daze me. L of G. is only to be rightly construed by
                    and within its own atmosphere and essential character—all of its pages
                    &amp; pieces so coming strictly under <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span>—that
                    the calamus part has even allow'd the possibility of such construction as
                    mention'd is terrible—I am fain to hope the pages themselves are not to be
                    even mention'd for such gratuitous and quite at the time entirely undream'd
                    &amp; unreck'd possibility of morbid inferences—wh' are disavow'd by me
                    &amp; seem damnable." <p class="tei_p">Symonds' reply on September 5 concealed his
                        disappointment. As a disciple he thanked the poet for stating "so clearly
                        &amp; precisely what you feel about the question I raised." But his opinion
                        remained unchanged: "It seems to me, I confess, still doubtful whether
                        (human nature being what it is) we can expect wholly to eliminate some
                        sensual alloy from any emotions which are raised to a very high pitch of
                        passionate intensity." The same reservation appears in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Studies in Sexual Inversion</span> (1897): "No one who knows anything
                        about Walt Whitman will for a moment doubt his candour and sincerity.
                        Therefore the man who wrote 'Calamus,' and preached the gospel of
                        comradeship, entertains feelings at least as hostile to sexual inversion as
                        any law-abiding humdrum Anglo-Saxon could desire. It is obvious that he has
                        not even taken the phenomena of abnormal instinct into account. Else he must
                        have foreseen that, human nature being what it is, we cannot expect to
                        eliminate all sexual alloy from emotions raised to a high pitch of
                        passionate intensity, and that permanent elements within the midst of our
                        society will emperil the absolute purity of the ideal he attempts to
