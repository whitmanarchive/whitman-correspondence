                    Mitchell (1829–1914) was a specialist in nervous disorders as well as a
                    poet and a novelist. On April 18, Whitman had his second interview with Dr.
                    Mitchell, who attributed his earlier paralysis to a small rupture of a blood
                    vessel in the brain but termed Whitman's heart "normal and healthy." Whitman
                    also noted that "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bad spells</span> [Mitchell] tho't

                    physician to indicate the psychosomatic nature of many of Whitman's ailments.
                    Probably Whitman's impending lecture on the death of Lincoln unconsciously
                    brought back the emotional involvements of his hospital experiences with
                    comrades whom he had come to love only to be separated from them. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00066_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="pml.00066_n1"><span>Horace Howard Furness
