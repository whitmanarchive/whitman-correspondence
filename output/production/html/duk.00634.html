                    January 3 and January 24, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter January
                    10, 1871, which fell on a Tuesday. Edwin Haviland Miller dated no letter to
                    January 1871 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). Bucke's date cannot be
                    confirmed, but many contextual clues suggest it is possible: Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman asked Walt whether he would visit in February. The son of Louisa's
                    former neighbor Margret Steers had lost a position with the Brooklyn Water
                    Board, and Louisa says Steers's son was discharged "with many others." That
                    remark is consistent with mass layoffs at the Brooklyn Water Works in late 1870
                    and early 1871. Also, Louisa did not know when her daughter-in-law Martha
                    Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman would visit. Though the exact date of Mattie's arrival
                    in Brooklyn is not known, Louisa began to expect her in early
                    February—though her arrival was delayed until late February. Because
                    Brooklyn Water Works employee layoffs were widely reported in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> in December and because the expected
                    visits of Mattie and of Walt are discussed as if some distance in the future,
                    January 10, 1871 is a probable date. However, no evidence in the letter provides
                    exact confirmation. Therefore, the letter is assigned a range of dates that is
                    consistent with its subjects, to Tuesdays from January 3 to January 24,
                    1871. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                        Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the

                        Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and his wife, who would become a close

                    Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. No letter from Jeff or Mattie from this period,
                    December 1870 to February 1871, is extant. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman probably
                    expected Mattie to report her plans for a visit that was anticipated to begin in
                    early February but was delayed (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00609">February 9,
                        1871</a> letter to Walt). Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat ailment that led to her death in
                    February 1873. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</span> (New York:
