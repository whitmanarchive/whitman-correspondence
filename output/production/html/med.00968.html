            <p class="tei_p">Many of the high officers of Government are at present
                sojourning among us; three of the President's Cabinet are here, and it is expected
                that the President himself will arrive in the course of a week. By good rights New
                York should be the proper place for all these functionaries to reside, in their
                official capacity. It is, in reality more central than Washington, and every way
                more convenient. A <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">second</span> rate city is liable to objections, as the seat of
                Government; but a large and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">first class</span> city is not—indeed it is the proper place.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Main street, Brooklyn, was the scene of a disastrous conflagration this morning.
                Fifteen houses were burnt—several of them used as stores. Much personal property was
                destroyed, besides; and the loss can hardly have been less than $50,000.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is a
                "grand mass meeting" of the Free Soilers at Abingdon Square, this evening. John Van
                Buren is to hold forth. So it seems he has had to take his coat off again, and mount
                the platform.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Thus far the yellow fever has not made its appearance, if the
                physicians can be believed, in New York, although existing for a fortnight past at
                Staten Island. Intercourse is debarred between the city and Quarantine. The occasion
                is seized to try the virtues of a new and powerful disenfectant, prepared by a
                gentleman engaged in an office in the Navy Department here. Certain medical
                personages speak of it as remarkably superior to "any thing out"—as better than
                chlorine, and not at all injurious to the lungs. "Forewarned, forearmed," is the
                motto that ought to keep off contagious diseases. We shall see how it acts in this
                case. I find it altogether impossible to convince folks that the yellow fever is not
                contagious, like small pox. Should we get the malady prevalent, some of your New
                Orleans doctors would come very acceptable here. I believe you have some of the best
                in the world. By the way, how comes on your University? Don't let the New Orleanois
                be discouraged at any difficulties in the way of establishing a school so worthy
                their great city, and so necessary in the South-west.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">We don't hear any thing more
                of that "Buffalo Hunt on the Rio Grande." Is it given up? A thousand adventurous
                spirits here hope not. The President, it is true, per the Washington Union, talks
                dignifiedly about observing our "obligations of treaties toward Mexico." Well, let
                him—as far as concerns him. But if there be a real disposition, in earnest, to go on
                this hunt, and three thousand tough fellows could be got together for the purpose,
                with American officers, I should say, "go it;" and it seems difficult to imagine how
                Mr. Polk could stop 'em. However, there may be something about the move, which you
                in New Orleans understand better than we do here. One thing there can be no mistake
                about; that the timid, malignant, idle and shiftless Mexican population south of us,
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">must</span> give way, sooner or later, to Anglo-Saxon energy and selfishness—for we have
                about as much of the last as the first.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The weather here is hot—no rain for a long
                time—gutters abominable—omnibus horses sad and drooping—butter dear and
                scarce—politics waxing fiercer and fiercer—decapitations of office-holding
                Barnburners begun, and doubtless to be continued actively.</p>
