                <span class="tei_lg tei_lg_type_poem">
                    
                    <span class="tei_l">Most glorious of the immortals! many-named! all-powerful forever,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Zeus! ruler of nature, steering all things according to law,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Hail!—for it is the right and duty of all mortals to address
                        thee,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">For we are the offspring out of thee, taking the one image of thy word,
                        as many mortal creatures as live and creep upon the earth.</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Wherefore I will hymn thee and sing thy power forever;</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">For thee this whole universe that whirls about the earth obeys, wherever thou
                        dost lead it, and is willingly ruled by thee.</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Such a servant hast thou—the two-edged, fire-breathing, ever-living
                        thunderbolt in thy invincible hands,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Under whose stroke all Nature shudders, and through which thou orderest
                        (keepest straight—in the right path) the universal Reason (<span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">λόγοs​ </span><span class="tei_corr">λόγον​
        
      </span></span>) which moves through all things, and mixes itself with the
                        greater and with the lesser lights—</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Nor does anything take place upon the earth without thee, O Spirit, nor in
                        the divine ethereal sky, nor in the sea,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Save only such things as the base &amp; wicked do in their folly—</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Yet thou knowest how to make superfluous things fit where they should go, and
                        thou orderest what is without order (lit. makest cosmic what is uncosmic),
                        and things that are not dear are dear to thee.</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">For thus thou dost harmonize into one good things with evil; so that there
                        should be one Eternal Reason, common to all,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">And this such of mortals as are evil fly from and neglect—miserables,
                        desiring ever posession of goods &amp; chattels,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Nor do they behold the universal law of God, nor hear it, which if they would
                        obey, they should have a fair and good life;</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">But they rush headlong, forgetful of the beautiful, some after one thing,
                        some another,—</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Some having an unholy thirst for fame, some turned to gain with a base
                        unrestrained lust,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Some to vice and the sweet works of the body;</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">—Hastening, verily, altogether, to become the contrary of these
                        things.</span>
                    <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_bb.00059.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_bb.00059.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_bb.00059.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                    <span class="tei_l">But O Zeus! All-giver! Veiled in dark cloud! Lord of thunder!</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Do thou save men from their miserable foolishness (lit. orig. want of
                        experience)</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Which do thou, Father, scatter from their souls; and give them to find the
                        wisdom by which thou securely steerest all things, according to justice,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">So that, being made honourable, they may repay thee with honour,</span>
                    <span class="tei_l">Hymning thy works perpetually, as is seemly for a mortal: for verily there is
                        no greater glory for mortal men or for the gods than this—to hymn
                        forever in a just heart the universal Law.</span>

            <div class="letter">

                <p class="tei_p">I thought you might care to see a full translation of this fine piece of ancient
                    Greek religious poetry, especially as it doesn't lie much
                    in the beaten way of readers of the classics, wherefore it may be new to you. I
                    don't think it has <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ever</span> been translated in print. I
                    have received the paper with the description of the Indian deputation, &amp;
                    also the proofs of your 'Critic' essay on Leaves of Grass, which interested me
                        <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">profoundly</span>—there are materials for a big
                    volume in it. I got too the paper with translation
                    from my essay, for which I owe the editor &amp; translator deep thanks. The translation is very good, though free—but
                    one mistake I should like to correct. I didn't say that the "beauty in L. of G.
                    worked all the deeper," &amp;c. "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">because it never seemed
                        intended for any aim or purpose</span>"—but "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">because
                        it (i.e. beauty) was never made an end &amp; object in itself</span>."</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I have received a long &amp; interesting letter from Dr. Bucke about my lecture. He is a man I should greatly like to know
                    personally—which perhaps may come about as he talks of visiting Dresden.
                    The translation of L. of G. is progressing well, though the necessity of taking
                    pupils which I am under now costs a good deal of my time.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I hope all is going well with you and yours. I was very sorry to hear of the
                    death of Wendell <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Philips​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Phillips​
        
      </span></span>, a good friend of Ireland.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Dynamite attempts making a great stir in England now—utterly barbarous &amp;
                    unjustifiable—but if people will sow the wind—!</p>

                <span class="tei_closer">
                    <span class="tei_salute">Yours always</span>
