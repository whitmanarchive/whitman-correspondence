                    <span class="tei_l">For thus thou dost harmonize into one good things with evil; so that there

                <p class="tei_p">I thought you might care to see a full translation of this fine piece of ancient
                    Greek religious poetry, especially as it doesn't lie much
                    in the beaten way of readers of the classics, wherefore it may be new to you. I
                    don't think it has <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ever</span> been translated in print. I
                    have received the paper with the description of the Indian deputation, &amp;
                    also the proofs of your 'Critic' essay on Leaves of Grass, which interested me
                        <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">profoundly</span>—there are materials for a big
                    volume in it.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I got too the paper with translation
                    from my essay, for which I owe the editor &amp; translator deep thanks.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> The translation is very good, though free—but
                    one mistake I should like to correct. I didn't say that the "beauty in L. of G.
                    worked all the deeper," &amp;c. "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">because it never seemed
                        intended for any aim or purpose</span>"—but "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">because
                        it (i.e. beauty) was never made an end &amp; object in itself</span>."<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a></p>

                <p class="tei_p">I have received a long &amp; interesting letter from Dr. Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">5</a> about my lecture. He is a man I should greatly like to know
                    personally—which perhaps may come about as he talks of visiting Dresden.
                    The translation of L. of G. is progressing well, though the necessity of taking
                    pupils which I am under now costs a good deal of my time.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I hope all is going well with you and yours. I was very sorry to hear of the
                    death of Wendell <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Philips​ </span></span>, a good friend of Ireland.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a></p>

                <p class="tei_p">Dynamite attempts making a great stir in England now<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a>—utterly barbarous &amp;
                    unjustifiable—but if people will sow the wind—!</p>

                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
