            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I want to thank you again for your kindness,—your kind remembrance of me.
                Christmas did me good, for at times I feel very friendless I only wish I could do
                something for you. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Walt dear I think too much of you to annoy you in any way. I think so much about
                home such a wish for you to get quite well. I should <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">never</span>
                forgive myself, it would be the worst trouble I ever had, if I said <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">annything​ </span><span class="tei_corr">anything​
        
      </span></span> to hurt you in the least speaking or complaining <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00663.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00663.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00663.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> don't mend things, and I write so
                seldom. I should at least write a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">cheerfull​ </span><span class="tei_corr">cheerful​
        
      </span></span> letter, but Charlie has just come home from down town
                says he has been writing to you (perhaps he has not I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> know whether to believe him or not) I am so uneasy I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> know what to do. I am so afraid he has said something that will worry you
                dear brother I know he does write fearful letters, every word the most untrue and
                unjust &amp; he's written a great many for I have opened and read them. I only want
                you to know that he cannot or does not say <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">one word of
                    truth</span> ever or at any time, when he speaks of me. I know <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00663.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00663.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00663.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> he writes to his
                sisters &amp; others very badly of me indeed, and have been told that he talks ill
                of me to any one and everyone that will listen. (he to day received a New Years
                present a box of hankerchiefs from his sister &amp; niece, &amp; letter of great sympathy for him in his
                unhappy home. they think it might do him good to come to them &amp;c, two hankerchiefs were for me, they are nice, but I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">cant​ </span><span class="tei_corr">can't​
        
      </span></span> appreciate them as I would, if they knew me as I am.) </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Dearest Brother I want you to know that I write to day feeling very unhappy and
                anxious, for fear Charlie has written something <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">disagreable​ </span><span class="tei_corr">disagreeable​
        
      </span></span>, if he has written &amp; you will mind it, you would understand why if you
                had</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Brother in my hurry I made a mistake, thought this was written on </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I hope with my whole heart that I have not said anything to make you feel bad for a
                moment, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you must not</span> that I could not endure. Generally I
                get along well as most persons, to day I am worried and excited, probably if I
                    <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">waited</span> till to
                morrow I should write differently. Next time dear brother I will write cheerfully,
                may be when you get this I will feel happy again. I have thought often if I should
                die <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ak tei_unclear_cert_low">someday</span>, I should
                not like Charlie to say I was crazy. (I am likely to live as he) &amp; you not know
                his way I used to be too sensitive to speak, but lately so many have spoken to me of
                it. its too absurd to mind I know  I do mind it. I
                have some comforts. I think a great deal of my home with all my troubles </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have only spoke of myself &amp; could not help it today </p>
