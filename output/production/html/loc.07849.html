            <p class="tei_p">Cloudy &amp; wet yet—am feeling fairly—the rain has kept me in lately of
                course—last night fair sleep—for breakfast small mutton chop &amp; br'd
                &amp; coffee—am sitting now by the fire (you can both imagine it
                all)—the Blasius people sent over yesterday to ask
                whether we wanted to "count the tickets" in the boxes first, as they were going to
                clear out &amp; destroy them—I sent word that as far as I was concern'd I sh'd
                not come for any such purpose, &amp; they might clear out &amp; destroy for all
                me—have had some visitors—(am the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">object</span> of some cranks &amp; lunatics
                among the rest)—grip on me palpably yet—the temperature getting colder
                here—I enclose the printed slip sent by Wallace,
                    England—also the Hort: Hall note—Horace
                we all miss y'r evn'g calls here—So I suppose you have taken in
                Niagara—the Lakes and the St: Lawrence too are not to be despised—Best
                respects &amp; remembrances to Dr Beemer &amp; to Dick
                    Flynn &amp; to half a dozen more friends
                there—As I look out of the window the last of autumn appears plainer than
                ever.</p>
