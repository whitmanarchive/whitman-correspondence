                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Friend:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Since our conversation this morning it seems to me that there is a desire to get the
                weight of your authority to back up certain late works of fiction, which are simply
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nasty</span>, without being in any sense true.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Inasmuch as your friends have all along been contending that the so-called "nude"
                passages in Leaves of Grass are simply expressions of eternal truth, and that their
                purpose is in the direction of a better comprehension of man and of the democratic
                idea, it would (I think) be a misfortune if you were drawn into a seeming
                endorsement of a sort of literature with which Leaves of Grass has nothing in
                    common.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel the matter so deeply that I have put my thoughts on paper, and now enclose
                them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sure you will not think me impertinent in so doing. If I did not so venerate the
                great truth of Leaves of Grass and so love the author, I should not have dared to
                write this.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours always,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">F.H. Williams</span>
