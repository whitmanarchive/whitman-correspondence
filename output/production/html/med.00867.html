            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Since our conversation this morning it seems to me that there is a desire to get the
                weight of your authority to back up certain late works of fiction, which are simply
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nasty</span>, without being in any sense true.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Inasmuch as your friends have all along been contending that the so-called "nude"
                passages in Leaves of Grass are simply expressions of eternal truth, and that their
                purpose is in the direction of a better comprehension of man and of the democratic
                idea, it would (I think) be a misfortune if you were drawn into a seeming
                endorsement of a sort of literature with which Leaves of Grass has nothing in
                    common.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel the matter so deeply that I have put my thoughts on paper, and now enclose
                them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sure you will not think me impertinent in so doing. If I did not so venerate the
                great truth of Leaves of Grass and so love the author, I should not have dared to
                write this.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

                    (1844â€“1922) was a Philadelphia poet and playwright who wrote several
                    essays on Whitman and two sonnets to the poet (included in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Flute Player and Other Poems</span> [1896]). He often welcomed Whitman
                    into his home in the 1880s and is frequently mentioned in Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, where Whitman describes the
                    Williams family home as "a sort of asylum (like old churches, temples) when so
                    many homes were closed against me" (See Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.66.html">Tuesday, September 18, 1888</a>). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00867_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00867_n1"><span>See William S. Walsh's <a href="med.00866">March 17, 1889</a>, letter to Whitman. Apparently,
                    Walsh's request for the poet's assessment of the "prevailing tendencies" in
                    current fiction, co-signed with James Gordon Bennett of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>, prompted a discussion with Williams about the
                    distinction between mere sensationalism and progressive attitudes toward sex in
                    literature. Traubel records Whitman saying: "No one would more rigidly keep in
                    mind the difference between the simply erotic, the merely lascivious, and what
                    is frank, free, modern, in sexual behaviour, than I would" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
