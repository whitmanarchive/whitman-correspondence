            <p class="tei_p">I should like, if I can do so without impertinence, to send you my grateful thanks
                for the, almost, new feeling or sense which you and the Leaves of Grass have endowed
                me. You have, through them, infused into my life and into the lives of many others,
                a fresher, healthier happiness than we knew of—and we thank you. I send you a
                paper<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> which I read in October last in Warrington,
                Lancashire, and let my sincerity and enthusiasm be my excuse for the utter
                inadequacy of treatment of a subject I both love and revere. We English are learning
                each year to know you better and to value you more. The Harvest of the Leaves is not
                I fear quite ready—but when it is, and the day is not far off—assuredly
                the laborers will not be few. May you live to learn the truth of this. I remain, my
                dear sir, with grateful thanks,</p>
