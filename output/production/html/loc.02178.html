                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred

                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would

                    Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
                    late fall of 1875. On <a href="med.00453">October 19, 1875</a>, Whitman
                    wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
                    Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
                    Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Times</span>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
