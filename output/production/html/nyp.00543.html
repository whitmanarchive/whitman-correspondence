            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Real glad to hear from you once more, as by yours of 18th—The death of Mrs:
                Gilchrist is indeed a gloomy fact—she had cancer, &amp; suffered much the last
                three months of her life with asthma—for a long time "every breath was a
                struggle," Herbert expresses it—the actual cause of death was dilatation of
                the heart. Seems to me mortality never enclosed a more beautiful spirit—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The trouble ab't my eyesight passed over, &amp; I use both eyes now same as
                before—I am living here, rather monotonously, but get along—as I write,
                feel ab't the same as of late years—only the walking power seems quite gone
                from me, I can hardly get from one room to another—sometimes quite force
                myself to get out a few yards, but difficult &amp; risky—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">O'Connor seems to be holding on at Washington—I think he is middling well,
                except the leg power—his "gelatine legs" he calls them—will pass over I
                rather think—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I drove down yesterday (Sunday) to my friends the Staffords, 10 miles from here,
                &amp; staid three hours, had dinner &amp;c—I go <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">there</span> every Sunday—So I
                get stirr'd up some, but not half enough—three reasons, my natural
                sluggishness &amp; the paralysis of late years, the weather, &amp; my old, stiff,
                slow horse, with a lurking propensity to stumble down—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The "free will offering" of the English, through Rossetti, has amounted in the past
                year to over $400—I am living on it—I get a miserable return of
                royalties from McKay, my Philad. publisher—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not $50 for both
                    books L of G. and S D for the past year</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">John, I like <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">both the names</span> in your note—I cannot
                choose—if I lean at all it is in favor of "Spring Relish"—either would be first rate—Did you get W S
                Kennedy's pamphlet "the Poet as a Craftsman"—I
                hear from Dr Bucke quite often—he was the past season somewhat broken in
                physical stamina &amp; health—but is better—he gives up for the present
                his European tour, but is coming here soon for a week—As I close, my bird is
                singing like a house afire, &amp; the sun is shining out—I wish you were here
                to spend the day with me—</p>
