            <p class="tei_p">The pleasantest event since I last wrote has been a visit from Mr. Eldridge.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> We had a long, friendly chat that did me good. Saturday evening we went to one of Miss Booth's<a href="#n3017" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3017">3</a> receptions—met Joaquin Miller<a href="#n0412" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0412">4</a> there, who is just back from Europe—of course we talked of you. Mrs. Moulton<a href="#n0422" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0422">5</a> too is hoping so you will come to New York during her stay here, which is to last a week or two longer. John Burroughs<a href="#n0129" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0129">6</a> has just sent me a post card to say he has returned from a 3-weeks stay with his folks in Delaware Co.—that he hopes to come here soon—wants Mrs. Burroughs<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">7</a> to come too &amp; board for a month or so—wants also "Walt to come—&amp; lecture"—but "Walt will not be hurried." Did I tell you that we found boarding here a young man, Mr. Arthur Holland, one of the family who were so very friendly to me &amp; made my stay so pleasant both in Concord &amp; Cambridge? He often comes to our room of an evening for an hour or two's chat, &amp; by the bye, being connected with the iron trade he has been able to make some enquiries for me as to what Per's<a href="#n2000" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2000">8</a> chances as a scientific metallurgist would be in this country—&amp; I am sorry to say he thinks they would be very poor indeed. Prof. Lesley<a href="#n0358" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0358">9</a> said the same thing; so it is clear I must not urge him to try the experiment, seeing he has a wife &amp; child. Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">10</a> &amp; Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">11</a> both well. Love from us all.

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    one half of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
                    who put out the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In
                    December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
                    Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become
                    a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a desk for
                    Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For more on

                    Cincinnatus Heine Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of
                    the Rockies" and "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness
                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
                    poetry; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and

                    Whitman met Miller for the first time in 1872; he wrote of a visit with Miller

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
