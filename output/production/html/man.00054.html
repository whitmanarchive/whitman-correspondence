                    (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
                    reviewed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boston

                        Republican</span> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
                    his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
                    appeared without Sanborn's name in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Springfield
                        Republican</span> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
