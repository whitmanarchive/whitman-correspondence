               I am getting up an Author's Valentine, which will be sold for the benefit of the Library, to consist of 
               literary excerpts in the handwriting of the authors and subscribed by them. In the hope that the Library's 
               good work in disseminating the best literature among the poor of this city, will appeal to your 
               sympathies, I beg to ask for a literary contribution from yourself, for such would greatly increase 
               the value of the "Valentine."
