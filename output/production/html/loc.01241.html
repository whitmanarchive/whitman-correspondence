            <p class="tei_p">I was right glad to get your card and find you hadn't forgotten me; and that you
                still keep going along, fairly cheerful. You must feel rather lonely at times. I
                have been wondering all night whether there is any sense in the world at
                all—and I don't know what to make of it! I have had a baddish time the last few
                days and feel tired out &amp; sick. A very dear friend of mine — we have been companions
                day &amp; night for many months now — has taken to girl whom I can't say I 
                much care for. She is right enough — &amp; they both have behaved awfully
                well to me; but just now I feel as if I had lost him and am rather dumpy
                — <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  I don't know that it will be
                altogether bad in the end.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am occupying a large attic here in a crowded &amp; smoky part of Sheffield, &amp;
                below am running a coffee tavern in conjunction with one or two Socialist friends.
                We (our Soct Society) have also a large room on the premises, and we have meetings
                pretty often, sociable evenings, lectures singing &amp;c. My friend of whom I spoke
                is in the cutlery trade, a razor grinder—very warmhearted free &amp; natural. Most
                of our fellows are very friendly &amp; sociable in their ways, &amp; we have good times. I
                still keep the place going at Millthorpe, &amp; spend part of my time
                there—and it is good to get out into the country from here. The
                    Fearnehoughs are still at Millthorpe, but Annie the girl
                has left and come into Sheffield to learn dress-making. Glad to hear from you
                any time, Walt. Write now &amp; then if you can. I suppose you will see Herbert
                    Gilchrist before long. With love to you as ever—
                &amp; we do not forget you over here.</p>
