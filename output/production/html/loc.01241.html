                still keep going along, fairly cheerful. You must feel rather lonely at times. I
                have been wondering all night whether there is any sense in the world at
                all—and I don't know what to make of it! I have had a baddish time the last few
                days and feel tired out &amp; sick. A very dear friend of mine — we have been companions
                day &amp; night for many months now — has taken to girl whom I can't say I 
                much care for. She is right enough — &amp; they both have behaved awfully
                well to me; but just now I feel as if I had lost him and am rather dumpy

            <p class="tei_p">I am occupying a large attic here in a crowded &amp; smoky part of Sheffield, &amp;
                below am running a coffee tavern in conjunction with one or two Socialist friends.
                We (our Soct Society) have also a large room on the premises, and we have meetings
                pretty often, sociable evenings, lectures singing &amp;c. My friend of whom I spoke
                is in the cutlery trade, a razor grinder—very warmhearted free &amp; natural. Most
                of our fellows are very friendly &amp; sociable in their ways, &amp; we have good times. I
                still keep the place going at Millthorpe,<a href="#n4124" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4124">1</a> &amp; spend part of my time
                there—and it is good to get out into the country from here. The
                    Fearnehoughs<a href="#n3063" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3063">2</a> are still at Millthorpe, but Annie the girl
                has left and come into Sheffield to learn dress-making. Glad to hear from you
                any time, Walt. Write now &amp; then if you can. I suppose you will see Herbert
                    Gilchrist<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">3</a> before long. With love to you as ever—

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
