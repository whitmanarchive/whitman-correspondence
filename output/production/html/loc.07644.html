            <p class="tei_p">Perfect temperature—sunny—cool enough—some breeze—I am pretty
                comfortable while I sit quietly &amp; dawdle over papers &amp;c. as the last three
                hours—but my head more or less thick &amp; floundering (dull ache) when I read
                with purpose—or write—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"> Two letters rec'd from you to day—Mrs Harned sent
                me a first rate broiled chicken for my dinner &amp; supper yesterday—I enjoyed
                all—Did I tell you I rec'd a long letter from O'Connor yesterday bright &amp;
                cheering as ever—nothing very special—(I think O'C is better)—I
                wrote last evening to Burroughs—Traubel writes him the news—Maurice how
                late down to are the proof pages you have? Write me without fail in your next &amp; I
                will send you at once—And how long to you get a letter hence—say [it] is
                mail'd here (Phila) say at 8¼ Monday night—when do you get
                it?—bowel dejectures quite mark'd, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">twice</span> the last
                four or five days—appetite fair—4 p m—Tom Harned brings me a nice
                homely cake-loaf from Mrs H—young Dr. Mitchell is
                here, gives me a dose for the cold-in-the-head thickness feeling I have so much of
                (has something with the suppressing of the free perspiration &amp; heat of days
                previously)—I have not the slightest anticipation from it—we are closing
                the most perfect day of this summer—I am taking some calomel this
                env'g—I am feeling fairly—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-07-15">Sunday, early afternoon—July 15</span>—much the same—weather
                pleasant—not hot—quiet—head little thick—am sitting here in
                the big chair—have eaten breakfast 10½ relishing fairly—no
                operation yet of last evening's calomel (every thing acts very slowly &amp; lagging
                on me, even a day or even two)—Have letters from friends of long
                ago—have just answered to an old N Y Broadway driver—also just a word to
                my friend Sylvester Baxter of Boston—Harned has just come in with a mug of
                peach ice cream from Mrs. H—&amp; Tom has just gone off with "Hamlet's Note
                Book" to add to Donnelly's Cryp[togram] with which T H is just wrestling—</p>
