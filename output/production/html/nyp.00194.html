            <p class="tei_p">About my book nothing particular to tell—I shall print it myself—also my new edition of Leaves of Grass—Most likely shall do it in the way we have talked of, namely by subscription—I feel that it is best for me to print my books myself, (notwithstanding some very good objections to that course, but the reasons in favor are far stronger)<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, you &amp; William have neither of you any idea how I daily &amp; nightly bear you in mind &amp; in love too—I did not know myself that you both had taken such deep root in my heart—few attachments wear &amp; last through life, but ours <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">must</span>—</p>

                    to Whitman: "Every evening we talk of you, &amp; wish you were here, &amp;
                    almost every evening we read from Leaves of Grass, read &amp; admire. I don't
                    believe, dear Walt, that you have in all the world, two heartier lovers &amp;

                    getting out the book yourself. I want it to have a large sale, as I think it
                    well might, and I am afraid that this sort of private publication will keep it
