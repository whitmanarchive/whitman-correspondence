            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of November 30 came safe, &amp; was truly welcome—if you have seen Mrs Howells she has told you that I intend returning to Washington this winter—I do not know how soon, but I shall come, almost certainly—Then Charles Eldridge is to be transferred to Boston—I am indeed sorry, on my own account, &amp; yours &amp; Williams, for he will be missed by us all, I believe more than he thinks for—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well as usual. Mother remains well, &amp; in pretty good spirits, better than I would have expected—My brother George still remains a prisoner—as near as we can judge he is at Columbia, S C—we have had no word from him—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">About my book nothing particular to tell—I shall print it myself—also my new edition of Leaves of Grass—Most likely shall do it in the way we have talked of, namely by subscription—I feel that it is best for me to print my books myself, (notwithstanding some very good objections to that course, but the reasons in favor are far stronger)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Nelly, you &amp; William have neither of you any idea how I daily &amp; nightly bear you in mind &amp; in love too—I did not know myself that you both had taken such deep root in my heart—few attachments wear &amp; last through life, but ours <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">must</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Good bye, dear Nelly, &amp; good bye, dear William, &amp; God bless you both—</p>
