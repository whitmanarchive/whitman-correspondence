            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have indeed been extremely sorry to hear firstly from the transmitted paper of 
                July 23 and then from your kind letter of July 31, 
                that your prospects of recovering your health seem to have darkened forever. You 
                are no old man, and I had always hoped that your giant frame at last should supersede 
                the lurking enemy. Even yet I won't give up hope. That you don't give up your 
                literary activity is to me a good token!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">From Kristian Elster I have not heard myself in a very long 
                time, and I don't wonder that he has not written to you. He is a true virginal 
                nature with the shyness of a virgin. As he was nearly suffocated by the dullness 
                and coarse materialism of the Norwegian Society, I pressed 
                him for two years ago (when he had previously sent me some very fine articles 
                for my periodical) to come for some months to Copenhagen. 
                I introduced [him] to some of the leading literary men and in some rich families, 
                but he did not come to them and I myself must fetch him in his lodging, when 
                I would see him. It seemed to him to be an intrusion to pay a visit, when not 
                expressly asked to come! This is the fruit of a lonely education in stern and 
                harsh national surroundings The Norsemen can be described in the shy ones and 
                the impudent ones. Björnson and Ole Bull 
                are of the last sort, Elster of the first. The meanest sort—as usual—has 
                first produced <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">its</span> gifted men: when the better sort in 
                its time has sprung into flowers, they shall all be forgotten. Then as truly as 
                Denmark is at this moment doing the principal part of the intellectual work of 
                the Scandinavian race, its accomplishment is kept back for Norway.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The intellectual work of the Scandinavian race! What a humiliating thought to us 
                Danes, that Hans Christian Andersen shall be nearly our only 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">representant​ </span><span class="tei_corr">representative​
        
      </span></span> to the world. 
                There are men in Denmark of such an intellectual greatness that Andersen was not 
                reaching to their knees. The world did to his last days take the selfish old man 
                for a child; the spirit of the Danish people is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no</span> child; 
                it [is] a warrior with the sword in his hand bleeding from combats, when he fought 
                one against seven, with great thoughts of his brow and stern resolution in his 
                eyes! At last Andersen lived only among our rich Jewish families, who endured all 
                his whims and harshness, hoping to be gilt by his fame. He was buried as he had 
                lived. The King and the Crown Prince were in the church, 
                reporters for foreign papers, also from America, swarmed everywhere; but there 
                was no wet eye in the whole assembly.</p>  

            <p class="tei_p">But our time shall come! Most probably America, in the next century, shall be the 
                vanguard of humanity, its greatest leading power. But <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">your</span> 
                eyes will not be open to see the outlines filled your bold hand has drawn. As 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">representants​ </span><span class="tei_corr">representatives​
        
      </span></span> for mental 
                power and intellectual vigor such people as Bret Harte 
                and Mark Twain are fainting away into ridiculousness. 
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ours</span> is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">next</span> future. You have 
                no idea of the intellectual decay that in Germany is accompanying the political 
                grandeur of the country. In June I met with professors and teachers of the 
                university who in all earnest were Buddhists, believers of nothings, or properly 
                spoken, believing that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nothing</span> is the true reality of the 
                existence of world and man. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">This</span> is the dark and black gulf 
                that Goethe and Schiller decked 
                with the flowers and branches of their genius. At present the flowers and foliage 
                are fading, and the black fathomless abyss of despair opens its giant yawn to the 
                horrified mind. The faith, the youth, the hope, the vigor of spirits, the soaring 
                flight of lofty aspiration, is only to be found in Scandinavia. Martin Luther 
                spoke the prophetic word: in the north is a place of refuge! The day of the 
                fulfillment is near.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have never doubted that I could make myself understood to you, and a letter 
                of business or concerning the usual affairs of human life I could most probably 
                write without faults at all, when I did take pains with it. But all the striking 
                expressions, all the elaborate work of the thought, is fading away beneath my 
                feather, when treating more difficult matters in English. I am never saying exactly 
                what I would say, and you know, my dear friend, that this is a great pain to anyone 
                who is accustomed to clothe his thoughts in the garment of language. I shall be 
                glad to receive your new books. A Danish philosopher defines a hero as a man who 
                is holding on the possible against probability.</p>
