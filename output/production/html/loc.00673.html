                <span class="tei_salute">My Dear Brother</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">How are you this morning.—I wish I was where I could come in and see you and do
                something for you—that has been a trouble to us, that we <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">cant​ </span><span class="tei_corr">can't​
        
      </span></span> be of the least benefit to you now when you are ill.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You dont know anything about how bad and sorry I felt about your illness</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You have been exceedingly kind and thoughtful dear brother to write to me, that first
                letter was very welcome I was wonderfully glad to get it, a little afraid you was
                hardly yet strong enough <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00673.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00673.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00673.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> to write.—Dear Mother too has been kind about
                writing I expect a line every day I am anxious to hear,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have not heard for eleven
                days—I do so hope to hear the good news that you are better, and are able to
                go out a little</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I feel glad when <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">its​ </span><span class="tei_corr">it's​
        
      </span></span> bright pleasant weather 
                I think maybe you will gain
                faster,—I know my dear brother you have a good deal of patience and that you
                do not easily get discouraged and that too is in your favour.—You have a good many friends I know, and have every attention,
                every little thing <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00673.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00673.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00673.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                done for your comfort that can be done, do you not Walt.—Still it would seem
                better, to us, if some of us was near you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Has George been to see you I suppose he has though</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And dear brother Jeffy too I know as soon as he can think
                of anything he will go to see you. I should like to hear from him and the dear
                little girls</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Do you remember Walt some years ago, what a bad time I had with my back (I think
                it was <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">neuralgie​ </span><span class="tei_corr">neuralgia​
        
      </span></span> of the spine) anyway I was well only my back I could not walk three
                steps for many weeks &amp; could sit up all day, &amp; when I could walk about &amp;
                even go up &amp; down stairs I was a good deal more than half bent over &amp; I was
                bent over so nearly as bad for more than a year,—I only speak of it so you
                will know how much time will do, my back is now as strong as it ever was in the
                world</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00673.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00673.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00673.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I do so want you to get well Walt, I shall be so happy when you are strong as ever
                again, and persons tell me you will be, a good many inquire about you.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You know your room here is always ready. I do hope when <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">it​ </span><span class="tei_corr">it's​
        
      </span></span>
                warm weather in June you
                will come. I remember you liked the mountain air here and I know it will be good for
                you And I have been thinking if dear Mother too could bear the journey, for it would
                seem just like home to you then, and I do not think it safe to stay in Washington
                like you did last summer, &amp; Charlie has a great wish to go
                away to the Adirodacks &amp; other places, &amp; its a
                great bother to leave the house alone with me, &amp; I would do everything in my
                power for you, dear brother</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I don't know why I have not written to you before, I wish I had something cheerful to
                tell you, things are just the same here I only want you to be well again I do like
                that young fellow that is so kind to you, Peter Doyle I
                shall always remember him</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Good bye my dear brother. I send you a great deal of love</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Han</span>
            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">Charlie also sends love</p>
