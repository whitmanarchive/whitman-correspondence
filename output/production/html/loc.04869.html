            <p class="tei_p">Frank and I read your "Old Age's Lambent Peaks" yesterday afternoon as we sat
                together by the sea and he thought and spoke much of you as he often do.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Friend—I wish that you could be with us to enjoy <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01329.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01329.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01329.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> on these, to me, beautiful <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">grey</span> afternoons when there is no glare from the sun, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">few</span> people, so that one may be almost alone on the quiet
                beach and have only one's thoughts and the sounding sea.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think you will be interested to know that my cousin, of whom I have made mention to
                you as being intimate with the Lewes household; has <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01330.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01330.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01330.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> just returned from England where he
                has talked much of you. He is one of Frank's converts to the Whitman side and is now
                most enthusiastic and fairly raves about you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When is the new book to be out I hope it will be a great success! You will be sorry,
                I am sure, to hear that Churchill has had Typhoid Fever he is
                quite recovered however by this time and is growing very stout. I dont suppose his

                told you, how very well he did in College last winter. He took the "English prize" and
                in athletics he did remarkably well, being the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sixth</span>
                strongest man ever examined in the University. I hope no one but yourself will see
                this letter as I am sure it would bore anyone else to read it but knowing your love
                for Churchill I have not hesitated to
