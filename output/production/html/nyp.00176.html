you stated in yours that you hoped that I had not forgotten you. I never will forget you so long as life should last.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Uncle I have got very near well. the wound in my chest has got nearly well. I am so that I can go about and do light duty. Also my arm is geting along nicely but their is some slight pain yet but none to stop me from writing such a kind and affectionate friend as you have been to me. May god bless you forever I cant find words to tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live to meet again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere there is no more parting</p>
