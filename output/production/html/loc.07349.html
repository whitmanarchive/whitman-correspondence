            <p class="tei_p">I arrived here at noon today saw Horace for a short time at
                Camden this morning (as he will have told you). I go to Camden friday morning but
                have a little business matter to attend to so shall not get around to your house untill say 1 or 2 P.M. (Guess you don't want any one earlier than that any
                how)—Am much pleased to hear both from Horace and yourself that your health is
                rather looking up than the reverse—but shall see about that friday. If Mrs
                    Costelloe should get out for 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> that
