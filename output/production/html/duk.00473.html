                    dated this letter only "Sunday." Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter January
                    20, 1867, but Edwin Haviland Miller dated it January 26, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 1:311, n. 31; 1:377). Miller presumably relied on Walt Whitman's
                    acknowledgment of a "letter of Sunday week, Jan. 26" to assign the date (see
                    Walt's <a href="nyp.00255">February 5, 1867</a> letter to Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman). Walt almost certainly responded to this letter from
                    Louisa—he referred to her "lameness in the wrist," and acknowledged Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman's possible trip to Washington—but January 26, 1867 fell
                    on Saturday. Because Louisa wrote "Sunday," this letter dates to January 27,
                    1867. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00473_n10 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00473_n10"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's

                    a type of massage, or perhaps she massaged the arm with the slippery elm
                    poultice that George Washington Whitman recommended. Alternately, she may have

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,
