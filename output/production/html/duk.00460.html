                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
                    Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
                    "Mattie" Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li></ul>
