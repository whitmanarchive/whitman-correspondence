            <p class="tei_p">we are
            permitted to see another
            rainy day but rather warm
            i am so glad walt to hear
            you say you are so well
            i got your letter to day
            and the book
            came all
            safe i was very glad
            to have it i have read
            it partly through and
            like it very much i stay
            at home so much that i
            want something to read
            i shall show georgey the
            letter about the interest
            he always gives me some
            money when he comes but
            he has had so much to
            pay every time he has
            been home that i dident 
            ask him for as much
            as i should if he hadent
            had so much to pay the
            taxes was i think 180 doller
            and he has to have money
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00633.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00633.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00633.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            to pay his expences
            walter you go around
            so much you must get
            some new cloths i think
            that gray satinet would
            make you a couple of
            pairs of pantaloons and
            vest but i dont think
            you would like it
            for a coat i think the
            pantaloons should be
            lined with thin muslin
            walter i gess you dont
            want to see me more
            than i doo you) i have
            just been reading about
            vanvories the ex supervisor
            that was shot sunday
            night in south brooklyn
            you will see it i suppose
            in the papers)
            
            i am glad
            you wrote to han and sent
            her the harpers i get it every
            saturday) you must tell
            me when you write how
