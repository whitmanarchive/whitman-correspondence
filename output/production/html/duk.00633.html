                    February 14 or February 15, 1870. The day Tuesday and "14" are in Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 1871.
                    February 14 fell on Tuesday in 1871, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
                    Bucke's date (see Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The evidence for the
                    month of February is Louisa's query about Walt Whitman's Valentines at the
                    letter's close. However, Bucke's and Miller's assigned year is incorrect, and
                    because the year is incorrect, the day of week and calendar date are off also.
                    Louisa noted the death of "vanvories the ex supervisor," and Dominicus S.
                    Vorhees, a builder, was shot not in 1871 but on February 13, 1870, a Sunday.
                    Valentine's Day, February 14, fell on Monday in 1870. Therefore, the letter
                    dates not to February 14, 1871 but to February 14 or 15, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    Fenian Brotherhood, which advocated Irish independence. According to the
