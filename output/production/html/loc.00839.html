               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent Jeff a letter three or four days ago, which I suppose he received. There is nothing very new with me—I see in the U. S. Senate yesterday they passed a resolution that it was the sense of the Senate that there ought to be an exchange of prisoners. I feel as if there was a fair chance of the box you sent getting to George—I wrote to Jeff how I was so much surer that a box from City Point, would go through, that I had sent a letter to Julius Mason<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> asking him to have a box made up there, &amp; sent, giving him the address, &amp; I or Jeff would pay the bill—if he writes to me that he has done so, I asked him to write if he got mine, I will send him the money myself—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, how are you getting along—we had a cold week, but the past three days has been much moderated—I am satisfied in the main with my room. I have such a good bed—&amp; my stove does very well—it is a little bit out of the way in location—My work as clerk in the Indian office is quite easy—I am through by 4—I find plenty who know me—I received a week's pay on Monday, came very acceptable—My appetite is not very good, but I feel very well upon the whole—I wish you would ask Wm Fosdick<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in the corner house for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>, &amp; also sketch of 51st I lent him, &amp; put them away—I am very glad I have employment (&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">pay</span>)—I must try to keep it—I send you an envelope, so that you can write me a letter soon as convenient. I send $1 for Nancy, the other for you—I may not write again till about the 12th, or perhaps 10th—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tell Hattie &amp; sis Uncle Walt sent them his love. I see Gen. Butler<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> says the fault of not exchanging the prisoners is not his but Grants.</p>

                    a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry. On <a href="loc.00398">February
                        10, 1863</a>, Jeff mentioned a J. W. Mason, who "used to be in my party on
                    the Water Works." When George considered staying in the army after the war, Jeff
                    conferred with Mason; see his letter of <a href="loc.00438">May 14,
                        1865</a>. Mason remained in the army until his death in 1882. According to
                    his letter to Jeff on <a href="loc.00838">January 30, 1865</a>, Whitman
                    wrote to "Captain" Mason the same day; on <a href="loc.00436">February
                        7</a>, Jeff noted that Mason had complied with Whitman's request. Whitman
                    apparently wrote again on February 13, and Mason replied from City Point on <a href="yal.00100">February 16</a> that a box had been sent to George on
                    February 10, and that Whitman's letter would be forwarded by "1st Flag of
                    Truce." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00839_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00839_n2"><span>Not listed in the

                    Massachusetts, on January 29, 1865, Butler blamed Grant for the collapse of the

                    this letter on December 13, 1888, Whitman was unusually moved: "O God! that

                    one part glory: the people who like the wars should be compelled to fight the
