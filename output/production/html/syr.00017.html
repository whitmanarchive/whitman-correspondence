                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend and master—</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am at last able to send you the lecture, which I have now got published together
                with another by a friend of mine here, delivered before the same society. I hope it
                may do something, however little, towards making the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  known here. If any American bookseller would like it, which is not, I
                suppose, very probable, he must write to the publisher, Tittman. We are selling it for 1 mark, which
                = I think a quarter of a dollar, about. I have sent a copy to D<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span></span> Bucke. Would you kindly
                transmit one to W. O'Connor? whose address I don't know. As to D<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span></span>
                Knortz, I fear it
                would be quite impossible to carry on the work of translation with him at such a
                distance. I have appended to my lecture a <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="translation​ ">transl.</span>​  of the Song of the Answerer, &amp; in getting this <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00050_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00050_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00050_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>translation into final form, I was
                astonished at the amount of discussion it gave rise to, between myself &amp; a German friend who
                looked over my proofs, showing that it would be quite impossible to carry on the work of
                translation with another person across the Atlantic. Besides I greatly doubt if he
                would go into it. His admiration for the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  is decidedly qualified by objection to your system of punctuation, use of
                participles, &amp;c., which matters seem to bother him more than they ought. His
                translations are sympathetic &amp; effective for the poetic passages—but when
                he converts a word whose meaning is a little remote or unusual, he <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">evades</span> the difficulty. For instance, here is his rendering
                of a passage from the Mystic Trumpeter (<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_nhg tei_unclear_cert_low">st.</span> 5).</p>
            <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_lg">
                <span class="tei_l">—Blow again, Trumpeter! Take for thy theme</span>
                <span class="tei_l">The All-encloser, the Redeemer and Orderer—</span>
                <span class="tei_l">Love, pulse of the All, of sorrows &amp; of joys,</span>


                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00051_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00051_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00051_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                <span class="tei_l">The heart of man and woman;</span>
                <span class="tei_l">No other theme than love—immortalizing, all-embracing, self-surrendering
                    Love.</span>
            </span></span>
            <p class="tei_p">On the whole I begin to fear that a complete translation is not feasible, at present.
                But I might possibly reckon on assistance enough to produce good renderings of, say,
                8 or ten of the longer poems, which might then be published in a small book—&amp; perhaps pave the way for something more: What would you think of this?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am sending McKay a copy of the lectures &amp; am asking him that we have a copy of the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L. of G.</span>​  with broad margins, if he has got one. The 1882 reprint is not very
                satisfactory in this way to me at least, as I like to make notes &amp; references in
                the book.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Things are going badly in Ireland. The <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_kc"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Government​ ">Gov<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">t</span></span></span>​ </span> is putting down meetings (of the National party) right &amp;
                left, for no reason, &amp; the people are getting very exasperated. I had hoped
                great things <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00052_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00052_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00052_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>from
                Gladstone's government, but that accursed Egyptian war opened my eyes finally to the
                mixture of hypocrisy &amp; injustice which lie at the root of English policy. If you
                could only live in Ireland for a while, &amp; see this sensitive, keen sighted, but
                helpless nation dragged about in the clumsy lurches of English
                Opportunism—seeing it all, knowing its own mind &amp; ideal but condemned to
                incapacity for realizing it,—you would wish us God speed. And yet I did not
                always see my way to these views myself. Now I must close—I was very glad to hear
                of your health &amp; pleasant circumstances, &amp;c. in your last letter. May this one find it all unchanged.</p>
