            yet he and mr Lane
            seems to get along
            very well  jeffy wrote to me after he was
            home that george would not be
            discharged as long as mr Lane was
            there
            george might save something
            i think if he was saving but these bad
            gals and amusements takes the green
                he s saving enoughf toward me
            i know i dont know how he would
            be if you didint send me so much
            but i think i shouldent get along
            so well if i depended altogether
            on him) O walt i feel sometimes
            like the irish when you give em
            any thing they always say long may you live and
            be blessed) but i dont know as i ought
            to complain of george he dont know how
            much it takes to keep house he is very
            good to me so long as i dont interfere
                with his affairs) the house
            is getting along
            very well they are putting up the stairs now
            so you dident like your new place as well
            as the old one
            well a person will get attached
            to any place where they live a long time)</p>
