                    25, 1868. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter "spring of 1869," and Edwin
                    Haviland Miller dated the letter "summer" 1869 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:80, n. 11). Miller's summer 1869 date is impossible: Moses
                    Lane resigned the position of Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works on May
                    1, 1869, but this letter refers to the safety of George Washington Whitman's
                    position as a pipe inspector so long as Lane remained as the chief engineer
                    ("Moses Lane," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Proceedings of the American Society of Civil
                        Engineers</span> [February 1882], 58). Bucke's spring date is also impossible,
                    as Louisa herself refers to "summer" in this letter, and she had noted in April
                    1869 that Lane was expected to resign his position after a new water board was
                    seated (see her <a href="duk.00578">April 7, 1869</a> letter to Walt).
                    This letter dates to the previous year, and it followed Walt's <a href=" duk.00652">August 24, 1868</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman. This letter responds directly to four matters from Walt's letter: the
                    receipt of stamped envelopes, Walt's dissatisfaction with his boarding
                    situation, a requested update on George's house, and an acknowledgment that Walt
                    has set a date for his coming September leave. Walt dated his August 24 letter
                    "Monday forenoon," and Louisa dates this letter "tuesday evening." One day for
                    letters between Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn, New York, is common if the
                    letter was sent before noon, so this letter dates to August 25, 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00577_n13 note" id="duk.00577_n13"><span>Walt Whitman enclosed "some

                        visits from the Price family in his <a href="pml.00025">September 7,
                            1868</a> letter to Abby H. Price, in which he also asked if he could
                        board at the Price's residence during his leave, a request that she accepted

                    <p class="tei_p">Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
                        movements. Her husband Edmund operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the
                        couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
                        1852, at 2 years of age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially
                        her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa
                        Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's letters.
                        Helen's reminiscences of Whitman are included in Richard Maurice Bucke's
