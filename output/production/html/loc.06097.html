            <p class="tei_p"> Just a line any how, dear Mary, to follow up the good wishes &amp; invocations of my
                last, &amp; to try the new address upon an envelope—As I write I am sitting
                here by the open window in the little room down stairs—a fine bright cool
                noon—have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  quite a mail this forenoon—in it your good letter of Aug.
                28—(yesterday Alys's circular arrived to me, at last)— </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I do not go out much—the effect of the sunstroke shocks still lingering upon
                me, &amp; probably will continue ("the ground already too well prepared," the doctor
                says)—have not written any for two months or over—But I am afraid I am falling into an unnecessarily sombre vein—which I ought not to, for I
                don't feel it, &amp; there is nothing to warrant it— </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I shall be looking for Alys now before long—&amp; you, dear friend, must make
                it up in frequent letters— </p>

                <p class="tei_p"> I have sent the pictures for Toynbee Hall to Rev. Mr Barnett—Mrs.
                    Gilchrist's address is 12 Well Road, Hampstead—You might take this letter,
                    &amp; read her as the latest—As I finish, Mrs. D[avis] brings in (presents from
                    friends) a dish of grapes, &amp; a great bunch of radiant yellow flowers mingled
                    with "snow on the mountain"— </p>
