            <p class="tei_p"> Just a line any how, dear Mary, to follow up the good wishes &amp; invocations of my
                last, &amp; to try the new address upon an envelope—As I write I am sitting
                here by the open window in the little room down stairs—a fine bright cool
                noon—have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  quite a mail this forenoon—in it your good letter of Aug.
                28—(yesterday Alys's circular arrived to me, at last)— </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I do not go out much—the effect of the sunstroke shocks still lingering upon
                me, &amp; probably will continue ("the ground already too well prepared," the doctor
                says)—have not written any for two months or over—But I am afraid I am falling into an unnecessarily sombre vein—which I ought not to, for I
                don't feel it, &amp; there is nothing to warrant it— </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I shall be looking for Alys now before long—&amp; you, dear friend, must make
                it up in frequent letters— </p>

                    Gilchrist's address is 12 Well Road, Hampstead—You might take this letter,
                    &amp; read her as the latest—As I finish, Mrs. D[avis] brings in (presents from
                    friends) a dish of grapes, &amp; a great bunch of radiant yellow flowers mingled
                    with "snow on the mountain"— </p>

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
