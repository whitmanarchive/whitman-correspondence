                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">My feeling and attitude about a volume of selections from my Leaves by Mr. Rosetti, 
                for London publication, are simply passive ones—yet with decided satisfaction 
                that if the job is to be done, it is to be by such hands.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> Perhaps, too, 
                "good-natured," as you advise—certainly not ill-natured. I wish Mr. Rosetti 
                to know that I appreciate <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his</span> appreciation, realize his delicacy 
                &amp; honor, &amp; warmly thank him for his literary friendliness.</p>
                
            <p class="tei_p">I have no objection to his substituting other words—leaving it all to his own tact, 
                &amp;c.—for "onanist," "father-stuff" &amp;c.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Briefly, I hereby empower him, 
                (since that seems to be the pivotal affair, &amp; since he has the kindness 
                to shape his action so much by my wishes—&amp; since, indeed, the sovereignty 
                of the responsibility is not at all mine in the case,)—to make verbal changes 
                of that sort, wherever, for reasons sufficient to him, he decides that 
                they are indispensable. I would add that it is a question with me 
                whether the introductory essay or prose preface to the first edition is worth printing.</p>
            
                <p class="tei_p">"Calamus" is a common word here. It is the very large &amp; aromatic grass, 
                    or rush, growing about water-ponds in the valleys—[spears about three feet high—often called "sweet flag"—grows all over the Northern and Middle States—(see Webster's Large Dictionary—Calamus—definition 2).]<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> The recherché or ethereal 
                    sense of the term, as used in my book, arises probably from the actual Calamus 
                    presenting the biggest &amp; hardiest kind of spears of grass—and their fresh, aquatic, pungent bouquet.</p>
            
                <p class="tei_p">I write this to catch to-morrow's steamer from New York. 
                    It is almost certain I shall think of other things—moving me to write you further in a week or so.
                </p>

                    <p class="tei_p">On <a href="loc.01317">October 12, 1867</a>, Moncure D. Conway reported
                        to Walt Whitman that John Camden Hotten had "contracted with W. M. Rossetti
                        to prepare and edit a volume of selections from your Poems." William Michael
                        Rossetti received £25 and twelve copies of the book; see William Michael
                        Rossetti, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span> (New York: Charles
                        Scribner's Sons, 1903), 240. Conway noted as advantages of this new plan
                        that a volume of selections would prepare the public for the complete work,
                        and that it was better to have a well-known English critic introduce an
                        American poet to the British public than an unknown American author like
                        O'Connor; according to Whitman's <a href="uva.00350">July 24, 1867</a>
                        letter to Conway, O'Connor was originally named as the introduction's
                        author. The irony, of course, was that Walt Whitman had written the
                        Introduction.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Hotten (1832–1873) printed Swinburne's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems and
                            Ballads</span> when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a
                        furor. Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856,
                        Hotten introduced to an English audience such writers as Robert Lowell,
                        Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Bret Harte. After his death, his
                        business was purchased by Chatto and Windus. In his letter to Conway on
                        December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of
                        Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare
                        this" (Yale). </p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pri.00011_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pri.00011_n2"><span>In addition, Rossetti
                    requested permission to delete "venereal sores or discolorations" and "any
                    depravity of young men" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                    Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel,

                    Rossetti noted in his diary, on November 28, 1867, O'Connor's "distaste" for the
                    "concession to the outcry against W's indecencies" and his intimation that
                    "Whitman, though resigned, is not really pleased at the publication of a mere
                    selection from his poems" (William Michael Rossetti, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti
                        Papers</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1903], 244). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pri.00011_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pri.00011_n3"><span>The material in brackets
