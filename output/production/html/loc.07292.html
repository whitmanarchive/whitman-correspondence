            <p class="tei_p">A warm (almost hot) day—sun shining like June—birds singing all about the
                grounds—have been for a short drive and am going again soon for another and to
                post this.</p>  
             <p class="tei_p">I have looked up the Sarrazin article and I find (as
                expected) that Kennedy is quite right. S. says that "Hegel is
                (according to W.W.) the greatest of the philosophers."</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have been looking up the "Encyclopédie" question and I find it a bigger one
                than I expected. There have been many "Encyclopédies" pub<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> in France in the last 200 years and they are hard to untangle one from
                the other. However here are a few facts: 1, The great, celebrated, "Encyc'." edited
                by Diderot was in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">21 Vol</span>. It was pub<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> from July 1751 to 1765. 2, The big "Encyc." called "Encyclopédie
                Méthodique ou par ordre de matiéres" was edited by C.J. Panckoucke, then
                by H. Agasse, then by the widow of the latter and<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00564.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00564.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00564.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> was published—first vol. in Nov.
                1782—and the last in 1832 (just 50 years coming out). The text (letter press)
                of the book was in 166½ (I think 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">to</span> vols, and the
                plates in 51 parts, equal probably to 25½ vols—making 192 vols
                altogether. Your line (p. 120 "N.B.") to be correct ought to read say like this:
                "While the many (or while the ? two hundred) quarto volumes of the great french <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Encyclopédie</span> are being published at fits and
                intervals in Paris" It is not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">quite</span> correct to call the
                book the "Encyclopédie <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Française"</span>).</p> 
                <p class="tei_p">We are all well, I am hearty, very glad to get home
                again after my run in the East—though I enjoyed my stay in Philadelphia
                immensely. I feel pretty confident I shall be East again in the course of the
                summer. I hope you will stick to the baths and a moderate rubbing with the hand or
                towel after each—and change your under clothes very often (two or three times
                a week) they need not be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">washed</span> each time but hung up and
                aired—washing flannel so often soon spoils it and is unnecessary</p>
