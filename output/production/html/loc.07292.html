             <p class="tei_p">I have looked up the Sarrazin<a href="#n3115" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3115">1</a> article and I find (as
                expected) that Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">2</a> is quite right. S. says that "Hegel is

                1782—and the last in 1832 (just 50 years coming out). The text (letter press)
                of the book was in 166½ (I think 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">to</span> vols, and the
                plates in 51 parts, equal probably to 25½ vols—making 192 vols
                altogether. Your line (p. 120 "N.B.")<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> to be correct ought to read say like this:
                "While the many (or while the ? two hundred) quarto volumes of the great french <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Encyclopédie</span> are being published at fits and

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    English translation of Sarrazin's essay to reveal Sarrazin's understanding of
                    Whitman's thoughts on the philosopher Hegel: "Surely, I repeat, as regards
                    thought this pantheism is not new, and we have but to examine it a little closer
                    to recognize under the mystic tide of words the theory of the identity of
                    contradictions announced by Hegel, the greatest of philosophers according to
                    Walt Whitman, ('Specimen Days,' pp. 174–177)" (Gabriel Sarrazin, "Walt
                    Whitman," translated by Harrison S. Morris, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re Walt

                    Harned [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893], 163–164). In the essay, "Carlyle
                    from American Points of View," Whitman explains that, when it comes to "the
                    impalpable human mind and concrete Nature," Hegel's "fuller statement of the
                    matter [the relation between the 'Me' and the 'Not me', according to Lozynsky]
                    probably remains the last best word that has been said upon it, up to date" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> [Glasgow: Wilson and McCormick, 1883],
                    175). See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Letters of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt

                    philosophers' contributions (including Hegel's) are "indispensible to the
                    erudition of America's future," "there seems to be . . . something
                    lacking—something cold, a failure to satisfy the deepest emotions of the
