            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs rec'd this morning—letter f'm Rhys also—Kennedy has sent me a letter
                he receives from F. W. Wilson, Glasgow, to hurry up the
                copy for the book "W W the Poet of Humanity"—as he, Wilson, is ready (&amp;
                even in a hurry) to publish it—I have heard from Karl Knortz, N Y, that he sent word to a German scholar friend at
                Zurich, Switzerland, to look after the proofs of the translation book (printed there
                by J Schabelitz, pub'r)—I have not heard f'm
                    Rolleston, since he sent me word that he had rec'd the
                first proofs from Zurich—have rec'd a Springfield Republican with a long
                criticism of "Whittier, Whitman &amp; Emma Lazarus" evidently by Frank Sanborn—wh I will send you in a day
                or two—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am fairly—sitting here alone, as usual—dark, rainy, glum to-day, not
                at all cold—it is near noon—Mrs. Davis has been in
                for five minutes—I hear Ed down stairs somewhere
                practising on his fiddle—no doctor now this week yet—Tom Harned and Horace here last
                evn'g—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1889-01-17">P M—</span>So the day whiles on—no visitors—pass the hours I know not how,
                yet evenly &amp; sort o' comfortably. Have rec'd a notice in San Francisco Bulletin
                wh' I will forward you—Have you rec'd two German papers with something
                in?—Still cloudy, lowering, rainy—near sunset.</p>
