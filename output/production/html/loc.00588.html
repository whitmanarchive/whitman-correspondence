         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> fear you took me last night for a female privateer. It's true that I was sailing under <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">false colors</span>.—But the flag I assure you covered nothing piratical—although I would joyfully have made your heart a captive.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Women have an unequal chance in this world. Men are its monarchs, and "full many a rose is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness in the desert air."<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Such I was resolved should not be the fate of this fancy I had long nourished for you.—A gold mine may be found by the Divining Rod but there is no such instrument for detecting in the crowded streets of a great city the [unknown?] mine of latent affection a man may have unconsciously inspired in a woman's heart. I make these explanations in extenuation not by way of apology. My social position enjoins precaution &amp; mystery, and perhaps the enjoyment of my friend's society is heightened which in yielding to its fascination I preserve my incognito; yet mystery lends an ineffable charm to love and when a woman is bent upon the gratification of her inclinations—She is pardonable if she still spreads the veil of decorum over her actions. Hypocrisy is said to be "the homage which sin pays to virtue," and yet <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I</span> can see no vice in that generous sympathy with which we share our caprices with those who have inspired us with tenderness,—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I trust you will think well enough of me soon to renew the pleasure you afforded me last P.M., and I therefore write to remind you that there is a sensible head as well as a sympathetic heart, both of which would gladly evolve wit &amp; warmth for your direction &amp; comfort.—You have already my whereabouts &amp; my hours—It shall only depend upon you to make them yours and me the happiest of women.</p>

                    conman William Kinney's various pseudonyms. In 1862 Kinney managed to establish
                    a fraudulent medical practice on Broadway between 8th and 9th under the name
                    "Dr. B. Coffin." Running his scam as Dr. Coffin during the day, Kinney's
                    evenings were spent posing as "Mrs. Ellen Eyre." As Eyre, Kinney would send
                    letters to prominent men in New York; the men would agree to meet Eyre at the
                    time and place appointed by her in the letter. As Ted Genoways notes, "What
                    exactly transpired thereafter is veiled in niceties of the period, but the
                    letters from several suitors, published later in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday
                        Mercury</span>, are highly suggestive. One invited Eyre for some 'twilight
                    entertainment,' another thanked her for 'your "loving kindness" at our last
                    meeting.' One man, offended at being asked for money, wrote that he never
                    considered 'our tender relations in the light of a financial operation.'" Kinney
                    was eventually arrested after a sting operation exposed Ellen Eyre's true
                    identity: Kinney performing sexual favors dressed as a woman and later
                    blackmailing men to keep the affair discrete. For further discussion of Ellen
                    Eyre's identity and Kinney's interaction with Whitman consult Ted Genoways, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and the Civil War</span> (Berkeley: University of
