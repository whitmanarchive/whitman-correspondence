            <p class="tei_p">I got your postal of yesterday this morning<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> and was greatly gratified to hear from
                you. I have wanted badly to write to you for three weeks past, but have really felt
                too sad and anxious to do so, besides being quite crushed with the dead heat we have
                been having, and sick with obstinate bowel trouble and my enfeebling lameness. I
                have felt that you and I were brothers in misfortune—I hope in all other and
                better ways too.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Words cannot tell how badly I feel at your confinement to bed and to the house for so
                long, and I enter into the irksomeness of it, combined as it is with

                in you to resist and endure—it is about all there is for us in life after a
                certain age is reached. My belief in your getting better is invincible, for your
                stamina is indomitable. If you can only get through this hot weather! It is our
                common enemy, and the worst. Everyone appears to be affected by it badly; even the

                truth and will make his way after a little, especially as the mathematicians back

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse

                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
