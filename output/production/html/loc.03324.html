                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got your postal of yesterday this morning and was greatly gratified to hear from
                you. I have wanted badly to write to you for three weeks past, but have really felt
                too sad and anxious to do so, besides being quite crushed with the dead heat we have
                been having, and sick with obstinate bowel trouble and my enfeebling lameness. I
                have felt that you and I were brothers in misfortune—I hope in all other and
                better ways too.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Words cannot tell how badly I feel at your confinement to bed and to the house for so
                long, and I enter into the irksomeness of it, combined as it is with
                strengthlessness and general illness. But I hope <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03324.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03324.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03324.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the spirit will still surge strong
                in you to resist and endure—it is about all there is for us in life after a
                certain age is reached. My belief in your getting better is invincible, for your
                stamina is indomitable. If you can only get through this hot weather! It is our
                common enemy, and the worst. Everyone appears to be affected by it badly; even the 
                well, and how much more the ailing!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I had two previous cards from you, one of June 17, and one of June 23. The proofs
                were read with much pleasure, and despatched to Dr. Bucke, as
                you wished. I was sorry you left in the one about the Red Emperor, but find some
                consolation in the sweet assurance that he is finally damned, and <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03324.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03324.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03324.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> can trouble the
                earth no more! Many of the pieces are very beautiful, especially the one about the
                nirwana sunset. I think the title very fine.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">When you sent the proofs, you wrote that you had been better all day—relieved
                from the prostration, and added that there had been a thunder-storm. See what
                atmosphere does for one! I think another storm is brewing today, and hope so, for I
                know it will give you relief.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I heard from our all-good Bucke the last of June, and owe him a letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I heard recently from Donnelly at London. His book is much
                abused by the English press, as by ours, but in private circles, among <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03324.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03324.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03324.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> lettered and
                cultivated people, it gains great headway. Dr. Bucke is not convinced (no wonder
                since a part of the secret was withheld.) But I have no doubt that Donnelly has the
                truth and will make his way after a little, especially as the mathematicians back
                him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I don't hear of Kennedy, but hope his book has prospects.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Charles Eldridge appears to have won a big law-suit. I daily
                expect to hear from him, and to hear that he has got his fee—a large one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">No news here. An even tenor. Nelly is pretty well, though under
                the weather, and sends her love and hopes. Cheer up, Walt, and take all the ease you
                can! I trust you can get out soon, if only for a drive.</p>
