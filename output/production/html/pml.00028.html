        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Abby,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Here I am in the same office, at the same desk, writing to you again—though the
        interval I know has been too long—but I will try not to let so long a time elapse in
        future. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">There is not much difference with me, in any respect—I have been, &amp; am quite
        well, considering—though I have had trouble from a cold during the winter &amp;
        spring—My situation in the office continues the same—The new Attorney General,
        Mr. Hoar, treats me very kindly—He is from Concord, Mass.
        &amp; is personally intimate with Emerson. Washington has been swarming with
          office-seekers—about half of whom have
        left—thousands <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in disgust</span>—it is quite a curiosity to see
        them around the Departments, in the hotels, and at the White House &amp; Capitol—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The O'Connors are well as usual—William is still in the Treasury <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Department​ ">Dept</span>​ —I spent last Sunday evening with them, at their house—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still boarding at the same place—I expect to bring out the final edition of my
        book the ensuing summer—stereotyped—(<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">positively last appearance</span> for the season &amp;c) as the play bills
        say—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Abby, I have been waiting till I felt in the mood to write a long, good [inter]esting
        letter to you [all?]—but it's no use waiting—so I
        write this. Don't be mad at me because I have been so negligent—You all have my love
        &amp; "best respects" to boot—how I should like just to come in &amp; spend the
        afternoon &amp; evening with you—&amp; Helen &amp; Emily—&amp; then have a good bouncing argument with Mr. Arnold, about finances, patriotism, &amp;c &amp;c—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">What do you think of
          Grant</span>—his doings—especially some of his diplomatic
          appointments—Washburn, for instance? </p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Good bye, dear friends—Love to you all. </span>
