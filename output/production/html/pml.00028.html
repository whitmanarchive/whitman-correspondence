      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Here I am in the same office, at the same desk, writing to you again—though the

        future. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">There is not much difference with me, in any respect—I have been, &amp; am quite
        well, considering—though I have had trouble from a cold during the winter &amp;
        spring—My situation in the office continues the same—The new Attorney General,
        Mr. Hoar,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> treats me very kindly—He is from Concord, Mass.
        &amp; is personally intimate with Emerson. Washington has been swarming with

        left—thousands <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in disgust</span>—it is quite a curiosity to see
        them around the Departments, in the hotels, and at the White House &amp; Capitol—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The O'Connors<a href="#n0452" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0452">3</a> are well as usual—William is still in the Treasury <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Department​ ">Dept</span>​ —I spent last Sunday evening with them, at their house—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am still boarding at the same place—I expect to bring out the final edition of my

        say—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Abby, I have been waiting till I felt in the mood to write a long, good [inter]esting
        letter to you [all?]<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>—but it's no use waiting—so I
        write this. Don't be mad at me because I have been so negligent—You all have my love
        &amp; "best respects" to boot—how I should like just to come in &amp; spend the
        afternoon &amp; evening with you—&amp; Helen &amp; Emily<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">6</a>—&amp; then have a good bouncing argument with Mr. Arnold,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">7</a> about finances, patriotism, &amp;c &amp;c—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">What do you think of
          Grant</span>—his doings—especially some of his diplomatic
          appointments—Washburn,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">8</a> for instance? </p>

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
                    the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's Monthly</span> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
                    deeply." For more information on Whitman and Abby H.

                    was Attorney General from 1869 to 1870 and was later a member of the U.S. House
                    of Representatives. Evidently during the last month of Johnson's administration
                    Walt Whitman had some uncertain moments as to his future, for on <a href="duk.00640">February 17, 1869</a> his mother asked: "walt what is
                    it you alluded to that was disagreable in the office." In his additions to the second edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, As Poet and Person</span> (New York: J.
                    S. Redfield, 1871) John Burroughs wrote cryptically: "and afterward, (1869,) he
                    is subjected, in another Department, to trains of dastardly official insolence
                    by a dignitary of equal rank [to Harlan], from whom he narrowly escapes the same

                    Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>,
                    an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
                    assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he
                    went to Washington. O'Connor was one of Whitman's strongest defenders, most
                    notably in his 1866 pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" (a digital version of the
                    pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). The poet praised O'Connor in the
                    preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was born sample here in the
                    19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood.
                    Thrice blessed be his memory!" In 1872, while living in the O'Connors' home,
                    Whitman strongly disagreed with O'Connor over the Fifteenth Amendment, which
                    Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in
                    response William moved out. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r0452">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_pml.00028_n3 note" id="pml.00028_n3"><span>In a publicity blurb in the Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Chronicle</span> on May 9, 1869 (reprinted by Emory

                    Whitman spoke of his plans for the summer: a new edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, "the collection, revised, and including his new
