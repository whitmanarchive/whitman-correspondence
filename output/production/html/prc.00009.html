            <p class="tei_p">In response to your letter to William O'Connor, I send herewith the piece,

                for the Galaxy. I presume it will be in time for the September number. I wish, if
                acceptable, you would have it set up <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediately</span>, proved,
                read carefully by copy, carefully corrected, &amp; then a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good
                    proof</span> taken &amp; sent to me here. I would mail it back again the same day
                I get it, so you would receive it next day.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If practicable, I should like to have the piece commence on an odd-numbered page of
                the magazine—&amp; wish it could come the second article in the Number.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The "Carol" will make about five pages more or less.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Please acknowledge the receipt of this. Direct to me, Attorney General's Office.
