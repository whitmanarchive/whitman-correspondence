                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
                    York newspapers until he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army and Navy
                        Journal</span> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
                    he established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866. Financial control of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William
                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
                    Francis wrote for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> the unsigned piece

                        glorious harvest of 1867, sown &amp; reaped by the returned soldiers, ought
                        to be sung in verse.…Walt Whitman is the man to chaunt the song. Will
                        you not ask him to do it for The Galaxy?" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                        the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                        Washington, D.C.). The editors, in a letter to Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.01278">August 8, 1867</a>, considered "A Carol of Harvest,
                        for 1867" (later titled "The Return of the Heroes") "to rank with the very
                        best of your poems." For images and a transcription of "A Carol of Harvest,
