                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
                    and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter
                    of <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00762">February 6,
                        1863</a>, <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>, <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In this letter, Lane pledged $5 each month. In
                    an unpublished manuscript in the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New
                    York Public Library, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have
                    distributed quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble
                    persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer,
                    Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's
                    letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of
                    Whitman's personal welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>,
                    he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00884_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00884_n2"><span>Nicholas Wyckoff was the
                    president of the First National Bank of Brooklyn. Whitman sent a letter to
