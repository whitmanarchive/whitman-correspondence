            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling relieved of the worst distress in the head, now for the last two days—had it straight along bad enough the first three days in the week—but yesterday 
                &amp; to-day it has mostly let up—have been out to-day, &amp; over to Philadelphia—it is hard work, especially as I have no one to go with me—but I put a bold face on, 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">&amp; my best foot foremost</span>—Is Wash Milburn there in the store? or has he gone on his vacation 
                in the country?—answer me in your next—I think of writing a few lines to him—Hot weather here, but I don't suffer much from it—though I think it is bad for me, 
                &amp; I hope much more from the cool season, if I get through this—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete I too see quite a good deal of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Railroad</span>, &amp; hear more—some 70 rods off 
                is the great depot of the Camden &amp; Amboy, bells &amp; whistles &amp; trains rumbling continually, 
                night &amp; day, &amp; lots of RR men living near, around here—if I only felt just <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01746.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01746.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01746.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01746.002.jpg</span>

                to Cape May, or to Long Branch, &amp;c. to say nothing of the numerous fine jaunts 
                from Philadelphia by RR. or up or down the Delaware by steamboat—</p>

                tell me who you see, &amp; every thing,—I like such letters far better than the formal ones some send me—I had a visit from a good, kind-hearted, rather queer old fellow named Ingram,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> from Philadelphia—he said he see in the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil.</span>​  paper I was laid up very sick in Camden—so he came over, &amp; hunted for hours through the hot sun, found me at last—he evidently had thought I was keeled up, &amp; hard up, &amp; he came to offer help—he has been a great traveler, is English by birth—I found him good company, 
                &amp; was glad to see him—he has been twice—so you see there are good souls left—</p>

                &amp; in the mean time tell him I send him my love—also my love to Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash 
                the next time you go there—so good by for the present my darling son, 
                &amp; you must keep good heart, for I do, though it is pretty glum around &amp; over me sometimes</p>

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    store in Philadelphia. To Horace Traubel, Whitman observed: "He is a man of the

                    desire to alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings

                    Columbia. He presided at the trial of John H. Surratt, which Whitman described
