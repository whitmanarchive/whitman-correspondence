            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter is rec'd to-day, and enclosed I send you $20—I want you to write soon—as I shall want to know if it reached you safe.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling relieved of the worst distress in the head, now for the last two days—had it straight along bad enough the first three days in the week—but yesterday 
                &amp; to-day it has mostly let up—have been out to-day, &amp; over to Philadelphia—it is hard work, especially as I have no one to go with me—but I put a bold face on, 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">&amp; my best foot foremost</span>—Is Wash Milburn there in the store? or has he gone on his vacation 
                in the country?—answer me in your next—I think of writing a few lines to him—Hot weather here, but I don't suffer much from it—though I think it is bad for me, 
                &amp; I hope much more from the cool season, if I get through this—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete I too see quite a good deal of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Railroad</span>, &amp; hear more—some 70 rods off 
                is the great depot of the Camden &amp; Amboy, bells &amp; whistles &amp; trains rumbling continually, 
                night &amp; day, &amp; lots of RR men living near, around here—if I only felt just <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01746.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01746.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01746.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                
                a little better, 
                I should get acquainted with many of the men, which I could very easily do if I would
                I should like much to go on the trips so handy &amp; cheap, right as you might say from my door, 
                to Cape May, or to Long Branch, &amp;c. to say nothing of the numerous fine jaunts 
                from Philadelphia by RR. or up or down the Delaware by steamboat—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—If you was only here to convoy me—but I suppose no one is to have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">every thing</span> wanting—(Pete, dear son, there was $89 coming to you, of the money you put in my charge, 
                &amp; now there will be $69 yet due you from me—your own soap)—As I write, 
                it is 4½ o'clock Friday afternoon—I am sitting here alone, in the 2<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span> story front room—every thing quiet here—I rec'd the other letter, &amp; Sunday Chronicle—when you write, 
                tell me who you see, &amp; every thing,—I like such letters far better than the formal ones some send me—I had a visit from a good, kind-hearted, rather queer old fellow named Ingram, from Philadelphia—he said he see in the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil.</span>​  paper I was laid up very sick in Camden—so he came over, &amp; hunted for hours through the hot sun, found me at last—he evidently had thought I was keeled up, &amp; hard up, &amp; he came to offer help—he has been a great traveler, is English by birth—I found him good company, 
                &amp; was glad to see him—he has been twice—so you see there are good souls left—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete when you see Judge Fisher tell him I shall yet be back all right one of these days, 
                &amp; in the mean time tell him I send him my love—also my love to Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash 
                the next time you go there—so good by for the present my darling son, 
                &amp; you must keep good heart, for I do, though it is pretty glum around &amp; over me sometimes</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Pete you must read this over Sunday, as a ten minutes' talk like, about all sorts of odds &amp; ends</p>
