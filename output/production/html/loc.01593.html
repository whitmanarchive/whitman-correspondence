                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Charley,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">If the next <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Morning Chronicle</span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> contains a "personal" about me, would you do me the favor to get
                half a dozen copies, &amp; keep for me? I shall doubtless return about the
                26th—as my leave expires that day. (I wished to stay to vote, but have paired
                off with a vehement Seymourite, an old friend of mine.) I suppose Nelly received a
                letter I sent her yesterday, to your care.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am writing this in my room at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis's. I came here yesterday, after
                three most agreeable days with Dr. Channing &amp; Jeannie. As I write, we are
                expecting a call from William O'C. as he promised yesterday to come over &amp; see
                Mrs. D. and myself, &amp; spend an hour or two. This afternoon, after dinner, Mr.
                Davis whom I like, &amp; get along with first rate, is going to take me out to ride,
                down to the Point, as I wish to see more of the harbor &amp; bay. I am treated on
                all sides with the greatest hospitality &amp; courtesy—&amp; yet left just as
                free as I wish to be. It is beautiful fall weather to-day. I go back to New York
                &amp; Brooklyn on Thursday next.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am profoundly impressed with Providence, not only for its charming locality &amp;
                features, but for its proof &amp; expression of fine relations, as a city, to
                average human comfort, life, &amp; family &amp; individual independence &amp;
                thrift—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">After all, New England for ever!</span>—(with
                perhaps just one or two little reservations)—With love to you,
                Charley—&amp; repeated again to dear Nelly. </p>

                <span class="tei_salute">Yours truly</span>

                    here—staid to dinner—We had quite a gay time—indeed quite a

                                    <span class="tei_p">"After an absence of some weeks, Walt Whitman, the poet, is
                                        just returning, we hear, to his residence and employment in
                                        this city. Besides visiting his mother at Brooklyn, and
                                        recuperating down Long Island and at Providence and Newport,
                                        he has spent quite a while 'loafing at his ease' in New
                                        York, among the streets, docks, throngs on Broadway, and
                                        upon the waters adjacent to that great metropolis,
                                        abandoning himself to one of his favorite spells of studying
                                        and enjoying the life and scenes there, not for pleasure
                                        alone, but to give color to his characteristic poetry. Mr.
                                        Whitman, however, we may say in passing, it is understood
                                        among his friends, has been for some time and is now
                                        principally engaged on a poem, or a series of poems,
                                        intended to touch the religious and spiritual wants of
                                        humanity, with which he proposes to round off and finish his
                                        celebrated 'Leaves of Grass.' He has also, we hear,
                                        completed several magazine pieces for publishers in London,
                                        a quarter where his productions appear to be in demand. A
                                        small prose book by him, 'Democratic Vistas,' will probably
                                        appear the ensuing winter. As we understand, Mr. Whitman
                                        returns to Washington all the more robust and healthy from
                                        his vacation, and with the prospect and purpose, in the
                                        leisurely way usual for him, of considerable literary work
                                        in the future."</span>
