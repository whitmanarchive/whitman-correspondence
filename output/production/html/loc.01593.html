                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Charley,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">If the next <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Morning Chronicle</span> contains a "personal" about me, would you do me the favor to get
                half a dozen copies, &amp; keep for me? I shall doubtless return about the
                26th—as my leave expires that day. (I wished to stay to vote, but have paired
                off with a vehement Seymourite, an old friend of mine.) I suppose Nelly received a
                letter I sent her yesterday, to your care.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am writing this in my room at Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis's. I came here yesterday, after
                three most agreeable days with Dr. Channing &amp; Jeannie. As I write, we are
                expecting a call from William O'C. as he promised yesterday to come over &amp; see
                Mrs. D. and myself, &amp; spend an hour or two. This afternoon, after dinner, Mr.
                Davis whom I like, &amp; get along with first rate, is going to take me out to ride,
                down to the Point, as I wish to see more of the harbor &amp; bay. I am treated on
                all sides with the greatest hospitality &amp; courtesy—&amp; yet left just as
                free as I wish to be. It is beautiful fall weather to-day. I go back to New York
                &amp; Brooklyn on Thursday next.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am profoundly impressed with Providence, not only for its charming locality &amp;
                features, but for its proof &amp; expression of fine relations, as a city, to
                average human comfort, life, &amp; family &amp; individual independence &amp;
                thrift—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">After all, New England for ever!</span>—(with
                perhaps just one or two little reservations)—With love to you,
                Charley—&amp; repeated again to dear Nelly. </p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours truly</span>
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt.</span>
            </span>

            
                <p class="tei_p">P.S.—Later—2 o'clock—William &amp; Dr. Channing have been over
                    here—staid to dinner—We had quite a gay time—indeed quite a
                    little dinner party—William &amp; Doctor, Mr &amp; Mrs. Davis, Nora
                        Perry, George Davis,
                    Katy Hinds, &amp; illustrious self—We are
                    just through—Doctor has gone home, not wishing to leave Jeannie too
                    long—William still remaining—I go presently on the drive with Mr.
                    D.—and also to deposite this letter in P. O.</p>
