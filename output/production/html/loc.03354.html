                <p class="tei_p">You will require a little explanation respecting some parts of the note. When I wrote and told him the book had come, I also told him that you had been dismissed from office in Washington, and that the American publishers will not publish your works. This intense stupidity of the publishers is, I think, the 'frightful' fact of all. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> was amazed when I read of the fact.

He is the most eminent judge of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Scripture</span> and painting in Europe, and his stamp upon any work is regarded as being as infallible as the 'Goldsmith's Hall' stamp on British gold ware.<a href="#n3014" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3014">3</a></p>
