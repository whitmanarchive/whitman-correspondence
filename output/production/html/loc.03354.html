            <p class="tei_p">Today I have had a note from Ruskin. This is a copy:—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Riley</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter was sent on here. I am very glad to know that I can give some pleasure to such a man. I will write to him directly. Send the book to Brantwood' [His residence in the 'lake district'] 'All you tell me is more frightful than I care to write of.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">You will require a little explanation respecting some parts of the note. When I wrote and told him the book had come, I also told him that you had been dismissed from office in Washington, and that the American publishers will not publish your works. This intense stupidity of the publishers is, I think, the 'frightful' fact of all. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">I</span> was amazed when I read of the fact. The 'pleasure'

                    I think is the greeting he can give you. He is the most eminent judge of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Scripture</span> and painting in Europe, and his stamp upon any work is regarded as being as infallible as the 'Goldsmith's Hall' stamp on British gold ware.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">He has no 'publisher,' though he could choose among the whole lot in England. His works are published by an old servant, and the price of his books is

                the same to a 'retail' as to a 'wholesale' buyer—I mean that there is no discount.</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">(I am writing very hastily, as I must go out and dig again as soon as possible, as the weather is favourable, and the 'season' is late.)</p>
                
                <p class="tei_p">I can do little, but something <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> be done, whilst you are living, to increase the knowledge of your works.</p>
