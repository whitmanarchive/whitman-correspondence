            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I suppose you have the hot weather too—it has been very hot here for the last four or five days, but I have got along very well—I think of you every day, with the work &amp; the heat, &amp;c.—I believe you said that it was good air around there in Pacific st., well I should think that was one great advantage over Portland av. any how. Mother, I rec'd your letter of last week—I do not go much to the hospital this hot weather—I think I feel better than usual now for a couple of weeks past—if I can only get through the summer as well as I am, I shall be satisfied—Mrs. Grayson gives me plenty of good vegetables, peas, string beans, squash &amp; new potatoes, with fruit now &amp; then, which is better than too much meat—Old Mrs. Mix<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> is well as usual—the house is very pleasant this weather—as cool as it can be any where—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I should like to hear from Han,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> but I suppose she is getting along in the same old way—As I am writing this letter at my table, the celebrated Mrs. Cobb<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> has just come in, to see about some rebel pardon, some profitable job for her, I suppose—she is a great piece—she is what most people would call a very pretty little woman—dresses gay, &amp;c—but she has too brazen &amp; silly a way, ever to be taken for a lady by any one that knows—she has got lots of pardons, &amp; probably made a fortune—is half the time at the President's—is not a good character. This Washington is a great place—you see how funny the world is governed—&amp; lots of queer doings that outsiders never dream of—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, my new shirts are done, half a dozen, very satisfactory—I havn't bought any new clothes this summer except a new hat, a big brim, light drab—makes me look like a southern planter, but is very light &amp; comfortable—Mother, I wish you could sit here by the window I have so often mentioned, &amp; have the cool breeze blow on you, as it is now, &amp; the trees &amp; river &amp; hills beyond, so pleasant—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear mother, you must try to take things moderate—because folks that worry &amp; overdo are apt to get the cholera, you know—I hope brother Jeff feels all right again<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—how I should like to see him, &amp; all of you.</p>
