                    Second U.S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.00596">September 17, 1863</a>, from the U.S. General Hospital
                    at Carlisle, Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
                    He expected, he explained on <a href="loc.00598">September 28, 1863</a>,
                    to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
                    on <a href="loc.00889">October 13, 1863</a>. He wrote on <a href="loc.00601">December 16, 1863</a>, from Culpeper, Virginia, that he
                    was doing provost duty, and on <a href="loc.00602">February 28, 1864</a>,
                    he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry
                    hard." He was wounded again on June 11 (so his parents reported to Whitman on
                        <a href="loc.00603">August 29, 1864</a>), was transported to
                    Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to
                    Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30, 1864</a>, he
                    wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have drempt of you
                    often &amp; thought of you oftener still." When his parents communicated with
                    Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.00605">January 26, 1865</a>, Bethuel was well
                    enough to perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom
                    Whitman wrote ten years later; see Whitman's letter to Bethuel Smith, December
                    1874 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, 6
