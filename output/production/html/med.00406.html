            <p class="tei_p">Your affectionate letter of March 30 has reached me, and has given me much
                comfort—for our acquaintance in this city at the last of the war, &amp; our
                being with each other so closely those two or three days &amp; nights before you
                went away, have left a loving remembrance of you which will never be effaced. I am
                well as usual—still work in this office—still board at the same house
                in M Street—&amp; I suppose hold my own generally about the same as when we
                were together—I suppose you have progressed a good deal &amp; I want to hear
                all about it—everything about you &amp; your fortunes will be
                interesting—&amp; the sight of you, dear friend, &amp; to have you with me
                again, would be more welcome than all. I will not write a long letter this
                time—but send you my love—&amp; charge you to write more regularly in
                future.</p>

                    <p class="tei_p">Walt Whitman began his correspondence with soldier Byron Sutherland on <a href="sjs.00001">August 26, 1865</a>.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Sutherland was now teaching at Jamestown, N. Y. In reply to Walt Whitman's
                        request for further information about his life, the former soldier observed
                        on <a href="loc.01954">April 8, 1870</a>: "You remember me in 1865 a
                        green vain (?) lad of Eighteen—without, even, an imperfect knowledge
                        of the rudimentary English branches, I came home from Washington and applied
                        myself, as soon as possible, to school and to study…My life since we
                        parted that July day upon the Treasury steps, has been one of hard work and
                        little recreation—I find on looking back to that time, that I am not
                        so pure or trusting—that the world isnt quite so fair and beautiful as
                        it seemed then—That the world is not precisely a green pasture for unsophistocated human lambs to skip in—That I like dreaming less, and work
                        or excitement better—That I have lost a great deal of Ambition, and
                        gained a like quantity of stupidity—That I dont know nearly so much as
                        I once supposed I did."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
