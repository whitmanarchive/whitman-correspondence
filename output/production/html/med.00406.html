            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your affectionate letter of March 30 has reached me, and has given me much
                comfort—for our acquaintance in this city at the last of the war, &amp; our
                being with each other so closely those two or three days &amp; nights before you
                went away, have left a loving remembrance of you which will never be effaced. I am
                well as usual—still work in this office—still board at the same house
                in M Street—&amp; I suppose hold my own generally about the same as when we
                were together—I suppose you have progressed a good deal &amp; I want to hear
                all about it—everything about you &amp; your fortunes will be
                interesting—&amp; the sight of you, dear friend, &amp; to have you with me
                again, would be more welcome than all. I will not write a long letter this
                time—but send you my love—&amp; charge you to write more regularly in
                future.</p>
