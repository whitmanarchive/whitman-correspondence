            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I think you would like to see Robert Sharland's letter so I enclose it. I have just got Bucke's 'Moral Nature'—at least Mrs. Gilchrist lent me a copy some time ago, but I have bought two copies now. It is very interesting, I think—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01236.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01236.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01236.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>it seems to explain to me the relation of animals to man,—the smallness of their <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">brains</span> does not really constitute a gap—even physiologically....I was going to ask you a question about the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">soul</span>, but the more I think about it the less can I make out what it was I was going to ask! It was something about whether the sympathetic comes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">next</span> to it, or whether it is inside it or outside it, or behind it or before it: or what? or is it 
                It?—but<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01236.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01236.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01236.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I fear such conversation is unprofitable.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is so jolly living in this farmyard. Our landlord is a farmer and our little cottage is only divided from it by a low wall over which the cows come &amp; put their noses, and there are the fowls and a pig and an old horse, and cats &amp; ducks &amp; things. The other side of the yard is an orchard, cherry apple &amp; pear, with the farm house. We are high here, I daresay 800 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="feet​ ">ft</span>​  above the

He is about 35, unmarried, a great reader (or has been so), but so quiet, homely, clodhopping like that few people suspect him

He is very anxious to travel but a good deal tied down at present. The farm, about 30 acres, belongs to him; and I suppose he represents a class of small proprietors, farmers, that used to be common in these parts, but there are not so many now. Everything is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rented</span> now in this country.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Our</span> household consists of Albert Fearnehough, his wife, and Annie a bright girl of 13. There is also a boy George who is apprenticed to a joiner in Sheffield. He

Now my lectures are over I am spending the summer helping in the garden and any odd jobs about the place—and am doing also a good deal of writing. I pretty well live out in the open air &amp; don't feel as if I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">sh<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span></span>​  ever manage indoor life again.

            <p class="tei_p">These friends that I have here and my more natural open air life seem to have made a difference to me. I feel as if I had touched the bottom at last, and had something firm to go upon—after floundering about so long. Thanks for all that also to you.</p>
