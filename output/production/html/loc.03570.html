                understand that a publisher's mere <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">opinion</span> would weigh with me, for it would not. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Now as to progress made—I have met with difficulties more serious than I expected. The
                work is ready, &amp; could go to the printer any day. But the printer is not equally
                ready for the work. I offered it to four publishers before I left Germany, agreeing

                expenses myself, &amp; all refused to take it up. I sent with my <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="manuscript​ ">M.S.</span>​  a copy of
                Freiligrath's article,<a href="#n0248" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0248">2</a> &amp; did all I could to secure a favourable hearing, but in
                vain. I am told there would probably be difficulties with the police, who in Germany
                exercise a most despotic power. Then other publishers I thought of trying are, I have
                been informed, rogues; and others again are dependent in various ways on court or
                official patronage—others would'nt touch it with it the end of a poker. So finally I
                came to a resolution a good deal <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03570.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03570.004_large.jpg</span> confirmed by what you said of the probable circle of readers of
                the first <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="edition​ ">ed<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">n</span></span>​ —namely, to let the book appear in America, &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">thence</span> make its way into German circulation. Once in print
                &amp; fairly before the public it will of course weather every storm, but the thing
                is to get it fairly started. Had I been living in Germany longer I should have tried
                selling the book myself—but that I can't do from here. Now in America, where
                your position is assured, I suppose some German publisher would take it up readily
                enough. 
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03570.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03570.005_large.jpg</span>
            I am going then to ask you to take what steps can be taken toward finding a willing
                publisher with some German connection. No doubt D<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span> Karl Knortz<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> would a useful person to
                apply to. (If you know him, &amp; could get him to glance through my proof sheets I
                don't doubt that the work would be considerably improved.) </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> As to terms, of course if any enterprising
                publisher would give me 100 dollars or so for the book I would let him have it (it
                being understood that you &amp; I should have our way about the form of the book,
                English version, &amp;c). But I would <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03570.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03570.006_large.jpg</span> be willing also to bear the expenses &amp; keep the copyright, if the
                former were not out of the way large—I suppose it would cost a good deal more in
                America than in Germany, where everything is very cheap, &amp; I have not much ready
                money to spare now. But I think I can rely on my father's helping me to the extent
                needed. If the book is printed in America you will be able to oversee technical
                matters connected with the printing to your own satisfaction. </p>

                The people are much more congenial to me than Germans, though these latter are more
                so than English. I was born in this house &amp; know every field &amp; nearly every tree since my
                childhood, it is wonderfully beautiful to me—a rich, undulating wooded
                land—deep grass &amp; crops, blue mountains of Slieve Bloom on the horizon,
                &amp; the stateliest trees, mostly ash &amp; beech, I ever saw. I have a great love
                for ash trees—such sinewy strength, &amp; a free, powerful method of branching,
                showing through the light foliage. What a country <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf005r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.009_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03570.009_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.009_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03570.009_large.jpg</span> this is! or would be but for

                evil, &amp; will be of more, unless some miracle should turn them into human
                sympathetic Irishmen. There was a time when I thought that Ireland could never be
                set free from English rule because the Catholic Church would instantly become
                dominant and inaugurate a system of religious tyranny which would crush liberties
                more important than <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">national</span> liberties. Now I begin to see
                that this would not be so for long. The Irish are much less Catholic than they were—dogmatic religion is loosening its hold
                upon them in a very remarkable way, &amp; hatred for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf005v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.010_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03570.010_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03570.010_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03570.010_large.jpg</span> Protestant England as Irelands ruler is a most potent cause at

                cultivated &amp; farseeing of the clergy, who consequently oppose the national
                movement as far as they dare. I have no doubt that in a free Ireland the Church would
                persecute as naturally as a 
                    wasp stings, but I am equally certain that a revulsion of feeling would come which (though attended
                perhaps with terrible struggles) would mark a real moral &amp; intellectual advance

                    poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In his <a href="rlc.00001">January 16, 1872</a> letter to Rudolf Schmidt, Whitman
                    wrote that Freiligrath "translates &amp; commends my poems." Freiligrath's review in the
                    Augsburg <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Allgemeinen Zeitung</span> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted
                    in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gesammelte Dichtungen</span> [Stuttgart: G. J.
                    Göschen, 1871], 4:86–89), was among the first notices of Whitman's
                    poetry on the continent. A translation of the article appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Eclectic Magazine</span>, 2 (July 1868), 325–329; see
                    also Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Abroad</span> (Syracuse:
                    Syracuse University Press, 1955), 3–7. A digital version is available in
                    Walter Grünzweig's "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/german/introduction.html">Whitman in the German-Speaking Countries</a>," which collects numerous
                    examples of German reception of Whitman's poetry. Freiligrath had promised his
                    readers "some translated specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete
                    translation. A sympathetic article on Whitman in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sonntagsblatt</span> of November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration
                    for the American poet. A translation of this article, which Whitman had a
                    Washington friend prepare, is now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. </span></span> [<a href="#r0248">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_uva.00476_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="uva.00476_n1"><span>Karl Knortz
