                    (1857–1911) was a Methodist minister, educator, lecturer, and collector of
                    rare books. In 1901, a special facility to house his large collection was built
                    at National Park Seminary, a girl's school in Forest Glen, Maryland. The Miller
                    Library was later auctioned off when the school closed, and the United States
                    Army converted the campus into a medical facility. Syracuse University currently
                    houses the Dewitt Miller Correspondence, a collection of thirty letters written
                    between 1881 and 1907. For more information, see Leon H. Vincent, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dewitt Miller, A Biographical Sketch</span> (Cambridge,

                    speech, well responded to by the audience," and the speech itself was published
                    in New York by the Truth Seeker Company in 1890 (Whitman's Commonplace Book
