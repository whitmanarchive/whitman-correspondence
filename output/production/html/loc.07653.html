            <p class="tei_p">A mark'd &amp; good &amp; welcome change of temperature the first thing in the
                morning—a merino undershirt &amp; socks—&amp; a coat—it is just
                right to-day &amp; it helps me—now past for nine days uninterrupted hot &amp;
                sweltering—frequent rains (evn'gs or nights) but not the least
                relief—(good they say for the corn crop)—I have been the last hour and
                over with the proof of "Elias Hicks," the concluding paper in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Boughs</span>—Shall have to wait &amp; slowly subside into some verdict
                (literary &amp; personal) for myself about it all—am not certain whether I am
                satisfied or no—Have just sent the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> (at their
                request) a short poem for Sheridan's burial—I
                expect it will be in H. 12th—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-08-11">Saturday—toward noon—Aug. 11.—</span>
                Delightful day—am sitting here ab't as usual—had my breakfast ab't
                9—(get my dinner ab't 4 or ½ past)—nothing very notable—rec'd
                a letter from Mrs. Costelloe—nothing very
                special—but I enclose it as you might care to hear—I also send proof
                pages 119 to 127—part of "Elias Hicks"—In a few days shall send 118
                &amp; all the rest—I send my best remembrances &amp; respects to Mr
                Harkness—I believe Herbert Gilchrist is coming soon back to America—quiet day here—</p>
