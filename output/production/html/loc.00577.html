               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt.</span>
            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Your letter came duly to hand, we have not answered previously because we have had nothing particular to say, nor indeed have we now any further than that the English periodicals appear to be waking up—that notice in the Saturday Review is quite a pungent one. The praise in regard to the mechanical execution of the book is great, from that source. It is more apparent however every day that a less, pretentious Edition to sell at $1.00 must be the one to be universally sold—we approve heartily of your idea in regard to a change in this respect—the fine Ed must be put up to 1.50 more would be sold at that price than 125 we believe, because when you make a difference in price people all at once see a difference in quality which they were blind <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00577.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00577.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00577.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>to before. If you make a book too good for the money—you ask for it, you degrade it at once. People <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">do</span> like to pay the cost of what they buy.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Still it is very evident that it was the best policy to insure the fine editions in the style in which they have appeared. It has commanded an attention and respect which we otherwise should not have obtained in certain quarters.  Have you seen the notice in the Literary Gazette—it is regular "out and outer." As I write I am informed that the Spectator has noticed it but I have not seen it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As soon as we get any thing worth while we will report it as an advertisement in the N.Y. papers.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">About Fall we should make an extensive push in the advertisement way. We are now receiving 300 applications a day for Imprints but the orders by mail do not seem to come in much yet—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00577.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.00577.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00577.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>probably owing to the season of the year which is more adopted to haying than reading. We shall probably dispose of all the second Edition before the close of next month and we think that we had better point it cheaper for the next Edition, with a small Edition of the other style with the addition at 1.50.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Let us hear from you further on this point—we do not think favorably of paper covers for a dollar book—nor paper covers for any kind—Let it be flexible cloth or cloth with boards.</p>
