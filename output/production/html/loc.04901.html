                   It is proposed to hold a Burnsiana Exhibition in Glasgow where a Meeting of those 
                   favourable to the proposal will be convened during next month. The promoters 
                   have in view a Loan Exhibition embracing Mss. of the Poet, the best editions of his works, painted 
                   &amp; engraved portraits of the Poet, as well as some of his friends and biographers, painted and 
                   engraved illustration of his works and of the scenes associated with his name; also the best books, 
                   magazines of early date &amp;c that in any direct way relate to Burns. We hope also to gather some 
                   items that formed part of the personal belongings of Burns &amp; his family.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Such an Exhibition in Glasgow—the capital of the West of Scotland—where Burnsiana property 
                    is largely held will be most appropriate in itself, and could not fail to excercise a healthy influence 
                    on all classes of the community.</p>

                    as Scotland's national poet. An early Romantic poet who wrote in both Scots and
                    English (often though not exclusively inflected by Scottish dialect), Burns is
                    perhaps best known for his poems "Auld Lang Syne," "Tam o' Shanter" and "To a
                    Mouse" (from which the title of John Steinbeck's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Of Mice and
                        Men</span> is derived). Of Burns, Whitman wrote in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
                        Boughs</span>: "Though so much is to be said in the way of fault-finding,
                    drawing black marks, and doubtless severe literary criticism . . . after full
                    retrospect of his works and life, the aforesaid 'odd-kind chiel' remains to my
                    heart and brain as almost the tenderest, manliest, and (even if contradictory)
                    dearest flesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone
                    poets." For Whitman's full opinion of Burns as it appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span>, see "Robert Burns as Poet and Person," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1888),
