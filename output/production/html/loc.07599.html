                <p class="tei_p">With yr welcome card<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">19</a> came to-night a letter fr. Gardner of Paisley,<a href="#n4318" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4318">20</a> accepting my MS. "Walt Whitman the Poet of Humanity." He is
                    going to pub. in 2 vols. Is evidently enthusiastic. The poltroon, however,(!) wants me to cut
                    out the censor's list of objectionable passages. I don't really know that they are
                    essential,—guess
                    I'd better let him. I suppose his idea is that people will buy L. of G. more if they
                    are not given the passages in question in my book. He bites hard—says "it wd
                    be a vast pity if the book were to fall through," owing to my obstinacy I suppose he
                    means. I shall satisfy him. Have written him to leave those out.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">We are having house painted. Do hope you will get over that cold, dear Walt. Thank

                    is little trouble, &amp; you can throw them on the floor when you get sick of em. Remembrances to

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
