                </span>
                <p class="tei_p">With yr welcome card came to-night a letter fr. Gardner of Paisley, accepting my MS. "Walt Whitman the Poet of Humanity." He is
                    going to pub. in 2 vols. Is evidently enthusiastic. The poltroon, however,(!) wants me to cut
                    out the censor's list of objectionable passages. I don't really know that they are
                    essential,—guess
                    I'd better let him. I suppose his idea is that people will buy L. of G. more if they
                    are not given the passages in question in my book. He bites hard—says "it wd
                    be a vast pity if the book were to fall through," owing to my obstinacy I suppose he
                    means. I shall satisfy him. Have written him to leave those out.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I too have a terrific cold in head. Am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">deaf</span> in one ear
                    temporarily, through sitting by open window (necessarily) where I work. But it is
                    nothing. Wax in ear only.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">We are having house painted. Do hope you will get over that cold, dear Walt. Thank
                    you for the news fr. O'C. the Transcripts are so thin I am ashamed to send 'em half the time. But it
                    is little trouble, &amp; you can throw them on the floor when you get sick of em. Remembrances to
                    Traubel &amp;c. It does one good to think of Dr. Bucke.
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">One</span> well man at least, ha, ha, thank God for 'em those hearty
                    "fellers." I take great delight in dogs for same reason.</p>
