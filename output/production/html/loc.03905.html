                winter—I busy myself writing some &amp; reading a little—am doing quite
                well with my books, &amp; have been all winter—when the weather permits I try
                to get out, but my strength soon fails me—has been so now five or six weeks
                &amp; gets no better, but I am in hopes things will take a turn—</p>

                could put in the whole day down at G—but I think of coming down next Friday to
                stay two or three days at any rate—a friend of mine here about my age, died
                suddenly yesterday, Judge Woodhall—I thought him the best man in

                months? &amp; is not over it yet—I got a long letter from her last

            <p class="tei_p">Susan I suppose you got the letter I sent you about
                twelve days ago—I also sent one to Harry about a week ago which he has not

                will go out &amp; put this miserable letter in the box, &amp; then take a few
                minutes walk around, &amp; see if it makes me feel any livelier—How is George
