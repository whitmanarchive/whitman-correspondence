            <p class="tei_p">The days go along with me pretty much after the old sort, though I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​

                winter—I busy myself writing some &amp; reading a little—am doing quite
                well with my books, &amp; have been all winter—when the weather permits I try
                to get out, but my strength soon fails me—has been so now five or six weeks
                &amp; gets no better, but I am in hopes things will take a turn—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Has been a pleasant Sunday here, coolish but sunny and calm—O how I wished I
                could put in the whole day down at G—but I think of coming down next Friday to
                stay two or three days at any rate—a friend of mine here about my age, died
                suddenly yesterday, Judge Woodhall—I thought him the best man in
                Camden—do you know Mrs Gilchrist has been very sick indeed, five or six
                months? &amp; is not over it yet—I got a long letter from her last
                week—Susan I am afraid this is not a very lively letter—I have just had
                my supper, &amp; feel as <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00503_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00503_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00503_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>well as usual, &amp; have no trouble particular to worry me, but I
                am sitting here up in my room alone, &amp; have been all day, &amp; feel kind of
                dull &amp; companionless—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Susan I suppose you got the letter I sent you about
                twelve days ago—I also sent one to Harry about a week ago which he has not
                yet acknowledged—Well it is ½ past 8, &amp; the moon is shining, &amp; I
                will go out &amp; put this miserable letter in the box, &amp; then take a few
                minutes walk around, &amp; see if it makes me feel any livelier—How is George
                getting along?—Harry told me he <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00504_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00504_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00504_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>was having a pretty good
                winter—has he drunk up the little bottle of Whiskey? Well there wasn't more
                than two or three good drinks any how—I shall be down next Friday in the
                4½ afternoon train to Kirkwood, if it don't storm pretty bad</p>
