                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Harry,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter rec'd to-day,—I am sorry you didn't go in &amp; read the piece your
                own self—it has got to be done, speaking in public, &amp; the more you hang
                back &amp; dread it, the worse it grows—after trying it on once or twice, you
                find it is nothing to be afraid of—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been busy all the forenoon fixing one of my little pieces <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"How I get around at 60 and take notes"</span> for the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​  paper, the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Critic</span>—they give me $10 a piece for them, &amp; want
                several more—I make use of my notes—at Timber Creek and Glendale and
                every where—I shall use them in a book at a future time—Hank, dear boy,
                I hope you are all right again by the time this reaches you—It is now noon
                &amp; I must get out a bit<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00200_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00200_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00200_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>—I went out &amp; took a
                short stroll, but my knees gave out &amp; I had to turn back—beautiful day
                here—I saw, had 10 minutes talk with the young lady lives next door but one
                above us in Stevens street, (I have spoken to you about) a great friend of mine,
                lived here ever since we have—I think she is the handsomest woman &amp;
                pleasantest ways for young, I ever knew—full figure, blonde, good hair, teeth,
                complexion, ab't 19, a worker too, cooks &amp; scrubs, but when she dresses up, she
                takes the shine off of all—(O that I was young again)—always feel better
                the whole day, when I can see &amp; talk with her</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">8½ Evening</span>—after supper, I will finish—Have
                been over in Phila—went out a ways on Market st cars—nothing to write
                about particular—Shall be down Friday in the 4½ p.m. train, to
                Kirkwood—So long, dear son—</p>
