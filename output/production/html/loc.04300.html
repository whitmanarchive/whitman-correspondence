                to do, and every succeeding hour and day it becomes easier to follow the same plan,

                interest in the success of Leaves of Grass. I was thinking yesterday of the

            <p class="tei_p">I received a letter yesterday from a friend who stated that he had just received a
                letter from Worcester, in which the writer says, that Mr Alcot<a href="#n0741" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0741">5</a>
                says, Walter Whitman is about to publish another edition of Leaves of Grass, leaving
                out all the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">objectionable</span> parts, my friend in reply said

            <p class="tei_p">He that receives the inspiration knows the best, but I with all my ultra radicalism
                would be delighted if some of the expressions were left out, the pictures are too <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">vived​ </span></span> in some instances. where it seems to me that common instinct seeks
                privacy, at the same time the entire nakedness of the intercourse is rather
                calculated to increase libidinousness in weak minds which Heaven knows is

                look upon an unnecessary expose of any personal enjoyment, whilst I would have the
                freest social intercourse, men and women associating humanly in all the true
                brotherly relations of life, insensably imparting the magnetism of humanity to each

                ground you have gone over hundreds of times, and I ought to have taken a hint from

                    impression on Tyndale. Whitman wrote to his mother that Tyndale "has been to see me
