            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I received yours of the 29th last evening and hasten to comply with your request. a
                friend in the City will send you a check today for fifty Dollars Hector would be very glad to do it, but he left the City last
                monday.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will help to pray for the good time which you evidently think is in reserve for
                you, I am quite sure it is—we all have times of groping in the dark but there
                is always enough light to find the true way, one thing has never failed me, that is
                to do <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this</span> moment whatever my best judgment says I ought
                to do, and every succeeding hour and day it becomes easier to follow the same plan,
                in that way I have been <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00696_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00696_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00696_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> enabled to overcome difficulties which many many times looked to
                be quite impassable. I never put off for tomorrow what ought to be done to day.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am I writing a homily? I did not intend it. I know you will excuse me for apparently <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">medling​ </span><span class="tei_corr">meddling​
        
      </span></span> with your business I can not help it perhaps as I feel so great an
                interest in the success of Leaves of Grass. I was thinking yesterday of the
                difficulty you must have in having the work published, it is so ultra
                the publishers and it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">occured​ </span><span class="tei_corr">occurred​
        
      </span></span> to me that it was quite possible that Mr Arnold or Mr Verner (I believe they have a press) could do it. With
                this hint I leave the subject to your better judgment</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mrs Walton has some means and I think would be willing to assist
                in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">geting​ </span><span class="tei_corr">getting​

            <p class="tei_p">I received a letter yesterday from a friend who stated that he had just received a
                letter from Worcester, in which the writer says, that Mr Alcot
                says, Walter Whitman is about to publish another edition of Leaves of Grass, leaving
                out all the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">objectionable</span> parts, my friend in reply said
                he had understood that you intended no such thing. but intended to leave out every
                thing but your own poems.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">He that receives the inspiration knows the best, but I with all my ultra radicalism
                would be delighted if some of the expressions were left out, the pictures are too <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">vived​ </span><span class="tei_corr">vivid​
        
      </span></span> in some instances. where it seems to me that common instinct seeks
                privacy, at the same time the entire nakedness of the intercourse is rather
                calculated to increase libidinousness in weak minds which Heaven knows is
                frightfully rampant, I feel constrained to treat all subjects of thought equally <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00698_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00698_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00698_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> free and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dispationately​ </span><span class="tei_corr">dispassionately​

      </span></span> upon the indulgence of any of the appetites I detest drinking songs,&amp;

      </span></span> food, and always consider their notaries as mean sensualists so too do I
                look upon an unnecessary expose of any personal enjoyment, whilst I would have the
                freest social intercourse, men and women associating humanly in all the true
                brotherly relations of life, insensably imparting the magnetism of humanity to each
                other, which would rectify the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">morbed​ </span><span class="tei_corr">morbid​
        
      </span></span> condition of society on the great subject of procreation, however this is
                ground you have gone over hundreds of times, and I ought to have taken a hint from
                your brief note, brevity is not generally a womans fort.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Please write me when you receive this, kind regards to your mother</p>
