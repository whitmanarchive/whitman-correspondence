            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I enclose the letters from Riley and Bathgate you sent me long ago, and which should have been returned earlier, and would have
                been but for the maelstrom confusion in which I have lived the sad year past. All
                the letters you told me to forward to Bucke went on to him
                except one, which was overlooked, and has been sent lately.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I was very much touched with what Ruskin wrote, which seemed to
                me to be very strongly on your side. You appear to <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03295.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03295.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03295.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> have a different impression, judging by
                some remarks you make in a letter of last October, and perhaps have some other
                information. It seems a great thing to say, as Ruskin does, that your book "is
                deadly true—in the sense of rifles—against our deadliest social
                sins"—and also that its fruit is "ungatherable save by loving and gleaning
                hands, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">and by the blessed ones of the poor</span>." I understand
                this as a high endorsement, coupled with a bitter indictment of English society. But
                maybe mine is a misreading.</p>

                Macaulay's article on you in the "Nineteenth Century."
                It is certainly very fine, and I greatly enjoyed it. His reservations were
                completely oversloughed by his eulogy.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Do you hear any more of Rolleston's German translation?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nation</span> this week (I have just seen it) does not print
                my reply, which may have come too late, and perhaps will appear next week.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Your postal card of the 14th came. What a good time you
                must have. Well I know that delightful <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03295.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03295.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03295.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Germantown landscape, and the unmatched
                Wissahikon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed about the Nirvana is good. I never believed that the Buddhist meant
                annihilation.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent Tucker one of Bucke's books, in souvenir of the
                gallant stand he made for you against the authorities. Did you send Mrs. Ritter one? I want to avoid sending to anyone who may have
                received the book already. You have probably sent one to Mrs. Gilchrist.</p>
