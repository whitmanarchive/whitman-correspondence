            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> was very glad to hear of the receipt of the check I sent you &amp; to know that it had already begun to do some good. I like very much your plan of aiding chiefly those frequent cases of suffering among the poor &amp; unfriended young men of whom I have myself seen so many in the hospitals—I am sure you must be doing infinite good to the bodies &amp; souls of these poor youths so far away from all other sympathies &amp; friendships, &amp; who now just seek a friend &amp; comforter as few are to them. The hospitals are too cold—too regardless of human feeling,—treating our brave volunteers too much like more professional fighters not mere like thinking &amp; suffering men.</p> 
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex.00167.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex.00167.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex.00167.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">tex.00167.002.jpg</span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is bad policy, as well as inhumanity, to treat them so. The effects of the iron will of our hospitals is discouraging to the hearts of our men, &amp; I fear it does more to prevent volunteer enlistments than all other causes—The difficulty of getting discharges &amp; furloughs, even in cases clearly demanding such indulgence, is very great &amp; seems to increase rather than to diminish—I wish some more humane rules could be established. I have tried to prevail upon those in authority to ameliorate the system, but without effect—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have received twenty dollars here to be forwarded to you, ($10 cash from my friends Henry Lewis of Boston, &amp; Benj. H Silsbee<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> of Salem,) but I retain it for a few days hoping to add more to it—Meanwhile<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex.00167.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Ftex.00167.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Ftex.00167.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">tex.00167.003.jpg</span> I have sent your letter to our friend Miss Hannah E.
