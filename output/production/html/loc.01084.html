                    author and friend of the art critic John Ruskin. His essay "Ouida" was
                    advertised in the 1881 Trübner &amp; Co. reprint of Whitman's preface to
                    his first edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman commented
                    on Bathgate later in life: "Bathgate writes genuinely, considerately: he has no
                    affectations" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.8.html">Monday, January 28, 1889</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r3019">back</a>]</li><li id="n3013">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3013 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3013"><span>John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
                    one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
                    via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
                    of <a href="loc.04038">March 18, 1879</a>). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
                    expressed "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">worry</span>...[that] <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> is...<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">too personal</span>, too emotional,
                    launched from the fires of...spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
                    letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of <a href="nyp.00445">October 7,
                        1882</a>). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
                    Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
                    of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
                        Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>, 17). </span></span> [<a href="#r3013">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01084_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01084_n1"><span>The letter is cut off
                    here but a transcription of the letter by William Douglas O'Connor shows that
                    Bathgate went on to quote a recent communication from Ruskin: "The reason
                    neither he (yourself) nor Emerson are read in England is first—that they
                    are deadly true—in the sense of rifles—against all our deadliest
                    sins. The second that this truth is asserted with an especial colour of American
                    egotism which good English scholars cannot, and bad ones will not endure. This
                    is the particular poison and tare by which the Devil has rendered their fruit
                    ungatherable but by gleaning and loving hands, or the blessed ones of the poor"
                    (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, New
                    York Public Library). For Ruskin's January 29 letter to Bathgate, see William
                    Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> (London:
                    Alexander Gardner, 1896), 84. See also the letter from Whitman to William
                    Harrison Riley of <a href="loc.04038">March 18, 1879</a>. On February 16,
                    Whitman received from Ruskin £10 for five sets of books through Bathgate,
                    to whom the books were sent on February 19 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles
                    E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
                    of Congress, Washington, D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
