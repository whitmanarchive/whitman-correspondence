Schmidt later altered his opinion
                    of Björnson, writing at some length on <a href="loc.01909">February 28,
                        1874</a>: "His poetry comes from the source that is throbbing in the
                    people's own heart. He has been the spoiled darling of the whole Danish public.
                    But he is a living test of the hideous and venomous serpent, that hides his ugly
                    head among the flowers of the pantheistic poetry. You have in your 'vistas'
                    spoken proud words of the flame of conscience, the moral force as the greatest
                    lack of the present democracy. You have, without knowing it, named the lack of
                    Björnson at the same time! Björnson owes Denmark gratitude. He has
                    shown it in the form of deep and bloody offences, that make every honest Danish
                    heart burn with rage and indignation." </span></span> [<a href="#r0088">back</a>]</li><li id="n0239">6. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0239 note" id="n0239"><span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">For Idé og Virkelighed</span>

                    from this time on—Schmidt became more and more intimately associated: I have always felt peculiarly
                    appealed to by him: his Danish renderings are, I am told, done with rare genius. Schmidt has had a
