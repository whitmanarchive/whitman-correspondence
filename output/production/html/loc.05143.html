                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have this morning received from you the large copy of Specimen days,<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">1</a> as also the
                1882 photograph, besides two postcards both of 9<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span></span> inst.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think you know that the present of the
                (largesize) book will be (is) appreciated by me—I am also very much pleased to
                have the photo, both to tell me how you look now and for my collection. The other
                copy of S.D. from Rees Welsh and Co. arrived on Mondy, I have been pretty well over it but so far have noticed no typographical
                errors, I shall go over it more leisurely after a little &amp; will look out then.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Rudolph Schmidt sent me a copy of his book containing his article
                on Walt Whitman I have put it in the hands of some Danish friends who are to
                translate it for me. Now my dear Walt I don't want to hurry you or worry you but now that you have L. &amp; G. and S.D. both off your hands and all settled I hope you will soon fix
                definitely about your visit here that we may get the "study" in shape for
                publication. I have scarcely touched it for months now but I do not lose interest in
                it or its subject. The appearance of S.D. will make a good many minor changes necessary 
                but as far as I see it does not make the issue of the "Study"
                any less desirable—I hope S.D. will sell and that Rees Welsh &amp; Co. will
                feel disposed to take hold of my book.</p> <p class="tei_p">O'Connor has never sent me
                that "Modern Thought" I will write him a card and stir him up.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">As to S.D. it is a
                suitable finish up to your work, it is what we (those who know something of you)
                have been wanting for a long time and what the future will want still more and will
                prize far more even than we can prize it now—it is all on a low key (as it
                ought to be) no fine writing but plain prose giving the <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_1 tei_gap_extent_word">[illegible]</span>
                just the insight that we wanted into your common every day life, and
                your ordinary every day manner of looking at things—I think you may now say
                that your work is done, I do not see any more for you to do at all events <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_ss tei_unclear_cert_medium">though</span>
                perhaps you will see something, when you have had time to look about again a bit.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An
