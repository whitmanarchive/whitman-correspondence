                    To Traubel the poet observed: "These gems, extracts, specimens, tid-bits,
                    brilliants, sparkles, chippings—oh, they are all wearisome: they might go
                    with some books: yes, they fit with some books—some books fit with them:
                    but Leaves of Grass is different—yields nothing to the seeker for
