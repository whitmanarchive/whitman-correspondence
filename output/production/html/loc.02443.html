                    delightful afternoon with J.W.W. in charming Rivington—a rural district
                    close to Anderton full of delights for Nature-lovers. It has been a splendid
                    September afternoon—a veritable halcyon day such as we have had many this
                    month—the sun shining with tempered power, a fine fresh breeze blowing in
                    our faces &amp; swaying the great arms of the autumn-tinted, majestic trees,
                    swallows darting &amp; screaming overhead, wagtails running across our path,
                    songsters twittering in the hedgerows. We walked together through the fields
                    &amp; along the highroad round by the bottom of the grass clad Pike—a
                    high-ish hill with a tower on top—skirting the edge of the lake whose
                    purple waters were dappled &amp; ridged &amp; scalloped by the wind, &amp; as we
                    wandered on beneath the azure canopy with its rose tinged cumulus clouds JWW

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
