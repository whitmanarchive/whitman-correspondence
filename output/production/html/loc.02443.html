            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Truly this has been a "red letter day for me! This morning's post brought a letter
                from Dr Bucke &amp; the noon post a post card &amp; newspaper from you &amp; a book packet from the
                good doctor containing a copy of "Man's Moral Nature" a
                newspaper with a story by Dr B. &amp; two pamphlets also by him! Also a copy of the
                original preface to "L of G" 1855.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">First let me thank you most cordially for your kindness &amp; for your kind words of
                approval of the photo's. I am glad you like them and
                since you thus encourage me I shall take the liberty of sending you a few more
                before long which I think will interest you
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02443.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02443.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02443.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            I feel very highly honoured by your wish to utilize my copy of the 1890 photo in your
                forthcoming annex. I shall send you the "plate" or
                negative probably by next mail &amp; you may keep it &amp; use it as you think best.
                It is not on glass but on the new substitute celluloid which has the advantage of
                being flexible while retaining its transparency, but it is used exactly in the same
                way as an ordinary glass negative &amp; any photographer can print from it by
                inserting it behind a sheet of clean glass in the printing frame</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By the way I noticed that Mr Wallace's large photo is
                "Copyrighted" by the photographer. I don't know how this will

            affect your reproducing my copy of it but you will know best. Pardon my mentioning
                it.</p>    
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to hear that you are keeping "well" from wh' I conclude that you have
                recovered from your attack of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Grippe</span> &amp; I
                sincerely hope that your health may continue to improve. May the coming Winter treat
                you kindly &amp; may naught but good be yours.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a visit the other day from Captain Nowell of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">S</span>.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">S</span>. "British Prince" with whom
                I went to Philadelphia. He was present, along with Herbert Gilchrist, at your Birthday Banquet 1889
                &amp; was introduced to you

            He sails again on Wed Sept 24<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> (due Phila. about Oct 6th) &amp; will probably call
                upon you on account of Mr Wallace &amp; myself, if it will not be troubling you too
                much to see him for a few minutes. He is a downright
                good fellow—and a handsome fellow into the bargain!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I hope "Warry" received the book on "Massage" all
                    right</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you please kindly put me down as a subscriber for your new book &amp; I will forward the cash as soon as I know the
                price?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am extremely pleased with Dr Bucke's most kind letter. He gives me some details of
                poor W.D. O'Connor's illness &amp; death which have a sad
                interest. His death must have been a great blow to you &amp; a loss to all who knew

                His (O'C's) intellect must have been of an exceptionally high order—J.B. said
                it was "like a Damascus blade, so keen, incisive &amp; penetrating"—&amp; he must
                have been an altogether unique man upon whose like we shall not soon gaze again.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to hear that "Warry" &amp; Mrs Davis like the
                photographs &amp; that they are both well.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">P.P.S. Since writing this letter I have been over to Anderton and have spent a
                    delightful afternoon with J.W.W. in charming Rivington—a rural district
                    close to Anderton full of delights for Nature-lovers. It has been a splendid
                    September afternoon—a veritable halcyon day such as we have had many this
                    month—the sun shining with tempered power, a fine fresh breeze blowing in
                    our faces &amp; swaying the great arms of the autumn-tinted, majestic trees,
                    swallows darting &amp; screaming overhead, wagtails running across our path,
                    songsters twittering in the hedgerows. We walked together through the fields
                    &amp; along the highroad round by the bottom of the grass clad Pike—a
                    high-ish hill with a tower on top—skirting the edge of the lake whose
                    purple waters were dappled &amp; ridged &amp; scalloped by the wind, &amp; as we
                    wandered on beneath the azure canopy with its rose tinged cumulus clouds JWW
                    read aloud your "Song for Occupations." Much did I enjoy listening to his valved
                    voice speaking your soul-animating words &amp; their precious message.</p>
