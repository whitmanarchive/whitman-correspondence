      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, it's over at last with dear Matty—I got a dispatch of her death 
        on the evening of the 19th—I suppose you have too, of course—It must have been 
        a relief from very great suffering, as Jeff's letters of late described it—
        poor dear sister, she has many <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">real mourners</span>—I have just written to Han about it—
        I am about the same—rather better—
