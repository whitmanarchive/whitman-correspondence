      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, it's over at last with dear Matty—I got a dispatch of her death 
        on the evening of the 19th—I suppose you have too, of course—It must have been 
        a relief from very great suffering, as Jeff's letters of late described it—
        poor dear sister, she has many <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">real mourners</span>—I have just written to Han about it—
        I am about the same—rather better<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—

                        Jeff's daughter Mannahatta, almost thirteen years old, wrote to her
                        grandmother about her mother's death: "when I got home from school the buggy
                        was out side of the door and papa said he would take Mama out riding as it
                        was such a pleasant day and Mama wanted to go so much. so papa lifted her
                        out and put her in the buggy and then went to take the reins and while he
                        [was] taking them Mama fell over in the buggy and when papa turned around he
                        did not know what had happened so he lifted her in the house and just then I
                        came home from school and found that Mama was dying but she seemed to know
                        me though she could not speak. I felt so bad that I did not know what to do"
                        (The Library of Congress).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Jeff on the following day wrote of Martha's death to his mother: "The
                        circumstances attending her death are quite impressive. Over two weeks
                        before it the Dr told me that I might expect her death at any
                        moment—that her lungs were in immediate liability to rupture and that
                        each breath she drew was a risk, that I must not leave her alone a moment.
                        On Tuesday she seemed to feel a little more like her old self—though
                        suffering much pain from the fact that the right lung had been pierced by
                        the gathering and the air in breathing would gather between the ports and
                        remain—her right side and breast were very much enlarged from this
                        cause—the pain was intense from the cancer and a few days before her
                        death the old spinal trouble came back to her—yet with all this, dear
                        Mother, did she keep up to the last—not a murmur escaped her—she
                        was cheerful to a degree and at noon of the day she died sat up in her chair
                        and directed how my lunch should be prepared" (Charles E. Feinberg
                        Collection).</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
