            <p class="tei_p">Am quite well with the exception of the abcess on my neck, it has come again. Dr.
                B—<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> lanced it few days ago but it dont appear to get much better.
                Recieved the papers and am glad to get them for it is the only way I can get posted.
                Most of my friends appear to have forgotten me or think me of too little importance
                to drop a line.
            Will leave here the first of next month and start for Detroit where I will put
                in a month or so if I can find bread and butter. Please send me a letter of
                introduction to someone there if you know any body it will make it much better for me
                and I will not feel entirely alone. I think perhaps Dr. B can give me a letter to
                some of his friends there as he is going to give a lecture there Wednesday evening.
                Don't get the blues worth a dam and dont expect to. Will close for the present.</p>

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    staying with Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician and
                    psychiatrist. Bucke grew close to Whitman after reading (and later memorizing)
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 and meeting the poet in
                    Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke claimed in 1872 that a
                    reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him to experience "cosmic
                    consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany. Bucke became the poet's
                    first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David
                    McKay, 1883), and he later served as one of his medical advisors and literary
                    executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson,
