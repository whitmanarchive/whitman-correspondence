            </span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I was very much delighted some weeks ago to receive a copy of the New Republic with a little memorandum 
                in your handwriting. Time does not diminish my reverential admiration for your work, nor do the 
                unintelligent remarks of the English press deter me from giving expression to the same in print. 
                I hope soon to have an opportunity of explaining at large, in a new series of critical studies of
                the Greek Poets, what I meant in the little note alluded to by the reviewer of the Quarterly, 
                &amp; to show how it is only by adopting an attitude of mind similar 
                to yours that we can in this age be in true unity with whatever great &amp; natural &amp; human
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00298_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00298_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00298_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_vm.00298_large.jpg</span> 
                has been handed to us from the past.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was the more pleased to have this communication from you, because I feared that the last time I wrote
                to you I might perhaps have spoken something amiss. I then—it was about three years ago, I 
                think,—sent you a poem called "Callicrates"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> &amp; asked you 
                questions about "Calamus."<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> Pray believe me that I only refer to this 
                circumstance now in order to explain the reason why since that time I have kept silence from a fear
                I might have been importunate or ill-advised in what I wrote. 
                There was really no reason why you should have noticed that communication; &amp; it gives me great

                satisfaction to feel that your friendly remembrance of me is not diminished.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now, though late, I may express the deep sorrow with which I heard of your illness.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> 
                How Whitman must have borne such a trial, no one knows better than one who like myself has learned to 
                have absolute faith in his manliness and vigour of Soul. Yet it is not the less sad to think that he
                who could enjoy life so fully, has met with this impediment.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I look forward with a keen foretaste of delight to your new volume announced.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a></p>
