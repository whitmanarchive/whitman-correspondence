            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I went round last evening to call on Mrs Rogers, &amp; thought perhaps I might find
                you there, but the house was shut up &amp; nobody home—the lady opposite told
                me Mrs R was down to Bridgeton to her brother's—told me Jane was up Thursday
                or Friday to get some things—Jane said Mrs R was getting along pretty well,
                &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w'd</span>​  be home in Camden very shortly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—And how are you? &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">how's all</span>? (as they say down south) I got a long nice
                letter from Harry yesterday—he is well &amp; hearty &amp; seems to be having
                good times—I shall write to him to-day—Well the work on my new book "Specimen
                Days" is finished, &amp; I feel as if a troublesome job was off my hands
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00026_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            The enclosed <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="advertisement​ ">adv't</span>​  will give you some idea of it—a great part of it was written
                down at the pond, the first three summers '76, '77 and '78 I was down there at your house—We could not get my
                brother Eddy boarded at the place I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="wished​ ">wish'd</span>​ —he is out temporarily at a place a
                few miles from Philadelphia—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">(While I am writing this it is a very pleasant quiet Sunday—as I sit here by my
                open window, a lady nearly opposite is playing on the piano and singing some good
                old hymns—"Old Hundred" and
                such—Keeps it up a long while—sounds first rate.)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am well as usual—Keep
                about on the same old round here day after
                    day—read or write two or three hours, &amp; then go out &amp; over
                the ferry to Philadelphia—I don't know what I should do without the ferry,
                &amp; river, &amp; crossing, day &amp; night—I believe my best times are
                nights—sometimes appear to have the river &amp; boat all to myself—</p>
