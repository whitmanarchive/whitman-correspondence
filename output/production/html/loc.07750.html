            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Sunny, cold, dry, very seasonable day, I continue on much the same—get out a
                little in wheel chair (but doubtful to-day—pretty sharp cold)—have quite
                rousing oak fire, &amp; great wolf skin fur on my big-limb'd ratan
                chair—Alys was here Sunday, &amp; I rec'd
                yesterday a nice letter f'm Logan—a day or two before the "Spectator" f'm thy
                father—(so I am not neglected or
                forgotten)—Give my best thanks &amp; love to all—am writing a little
                (enclosed I fancy will be in Feb: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>)—three slips, one for thy father—one for
                 Logan—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Probably every thing in our great United States (now 42 of them) goes on well all in
                a monotonous &amp; matter of fact way—"blessed is that country that has <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no</span> history"—we have an unprecedently humdrum
                President &amp; big men, but down in the myriad inner
                popular currents the moral &amp; literary &amp; pecuniary &amp; even political flow
                &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good flow</span> are grand—we can console our hearts
                with that—on a great democratic scale the present &amp; here are probably
                ahead &amp; better than all time past, or any other land—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">&amp; thats what America is for</span>—&amp; that satisfies
                me—that general unmistakable certain trend does—I dont mind little
                bothers &amp; exceptions &amp; some hoggishness—</p>
