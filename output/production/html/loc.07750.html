                little in wheel chair (but doubtful to-day—pretty sharp cold)—have quite
                rousing oak fire, &amp; great wolf skin fur on my big-limb'd ratan

            <p class="tei_p">Probably every thing in our great United States (now 42 of them) goes on well all in
                a monotonous &amp; matter of fact way—"blessed is that country that has <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">no</span> history"—we have an unprecedently humdrum

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
