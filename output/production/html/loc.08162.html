                It was a fine day and I went around the town with D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J. while he made his daily visits.
                Sat in the carriage while he went in the houses.  We went to a hotel to dinner—then 8 of us went for 
                a 20 mile drive through as picturesque a country as I have seen any where—had tea 8 miles from here with
                another Whitman friend (Rev. Thompson<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a>) then he came to Bolton with us. By this time it was after 8 o'clock
                and on reaching Johnston's house we found half a room full of men waiting for us—from then to midnight
                was constant talk, songs, recitation, supper, and good fellowship generally. You are right to say that the Bolton
                friends are true and tender—they are that and if there are any stronger words you may use them!
                Most of the evening I laughed<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00529.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00529.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00529.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_zs.00529.jpg</span> and the rest of it I could have cried their warmhearted

                set to music and which the whole room sang together in the middle of the evening—of course I made a speech
                of thanks and two other quite long speeches in the course of the evening—and I really spoke quite decently!
                a wonderful thing for me.

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Bolton, England, landing at Philadelphia on September 8, 1891 (Horace Traubel,

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).

                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,

                    apparently suggested that the poet give it to the Bolton group. Bucke duly took

                    me." On August 3 he wrote to Mrs. Davis: "I need not to tell you how deeply I
                    prize it. It is a very precious &amp; affecting souvenir of Mr. Whitman—of
                    his lonely room, his thoughts &amp; memories, &amp; the cheer received from the
                    canary's (also caged imprisoned) joyous warblings. It connects itself with
