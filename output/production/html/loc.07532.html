                    O'C[onnor]'s letter to me describing the situation wh' you
                must have rec'd—My poor dear friend Wm O'C—my
                brother in affliction—I have been out &amp; had a thorough bath in the tub,
                (with Ed's assistance,) &amp; complete clothe change, specially
                under—</p>

                shall tackle my breakfast presently, had a fair night—sent big books off, (by
                express) to Boston yesterday afternoon to Kennedy, Baxter, Mrs. Fairchild, Harland &amp; Frank Sanborn, (for Christmas
                presents)—yours of 20th rec'd this morning—</p>

                decided—(first in four days)—my brother George
                comes every day—bro't from Lou a good quilted lap robe to
                go over my knees &amp; feet as I sit, very useful &amp; acceptable—</p>

                nearest approximation for a tolerable day for six months and more—I am
                fearfully weak yet but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the feeling</span> &amp; the comparative ease
                are like something toward sanity—I may fall back—but O that I can keep
                up the standard of to-day, moderate as it is—had my mutton-broth &amp; couple
                of good raw oysters for my supper, 4¾ (no dinner)—as it is I am sitting
                by the wood fire—comfortable—Ed is snoozing on the couch—every
                thing is quiet—Christmas is near at hand &amp; seems to be made extra much of
                here—Hope it will be a merry one with you all—</p>
