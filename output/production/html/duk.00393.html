                    Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
                    treatment of Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder,

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
