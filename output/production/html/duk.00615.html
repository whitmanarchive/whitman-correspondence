    <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00615_n1 note" id="duk.00615_n1"><span>This letter dates to May 5
                    or May 6, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1873. This
                    letter is probably the "short letter of yesterday" that Walt Whitman mentioned
                    in his <a href="yal.00416">May 7, 1873</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman. In addition, this letter acknowledged Louisa's receipt Saturday of
                    $5 that Walt had sent on Thursday or Friday. Although Walt's letter sending
                    the $5 is not extant, in his <a href="yal.00415">April 30, 1873</a>
                    letter he had promised to enclose the money in "my next [letter]." Walt in his
                    reply to this letter worried about his mother's condition, a concern elicited by
                    the shortness of this letter, the deficiency of her handwriting, and her report
                    of "a trembling in my whole system" (see Walt's <a href="yal.00416">May 7,
                        1873</a>). If Louisa received Walt's Thursday or Friday letter on
                    Saturday, May 3, and she had received another letter ("one to today") from Walt,
                    this letter—the "short letter" that elicited Walt's worried May 7
                    response—dates to May 5 or May 6, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
                    spring 1871, and they were soon living at 322 Stevens Street in Camden, New
                    Jersey. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
                    with George and Lou in the Stevens Street house in August 1872, with Walt
                    Whitman responsible for Edward's board. Her health in decline, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman was displeased with the living arrangement and confided many
                    frustrations, often directed at Lou, in her letters to Walt. She never developed
                    the close companionship with Lou that she had with Jeff's wife Martha Mitchell
                    "Mattie" Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00615_n7 note" id="duk.00615_n7"><span>The "aunt" who was engaged

                    Whitman described Lou's aunt as English, and Louisa was not fond of the aunt's
