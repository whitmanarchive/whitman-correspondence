        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter came with the sad news of good Mr. Dille's death—I had seen it in the paper—I have thought much of it, 
        through the interesting account you gave—Indeed death has been much in my quiet thoughts &amp; musings now for many months.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, there is nothing very new to write you—I have not been so well the past week—but feel better this evening. I still have spells of great distress in the head—though they pass over—Walking no better—but 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">general strength</span> seems to steadily though very slowly improve—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am writing some war memoranda in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Weekly N. Y. Graphic</span> first number just out—ask Charley to get it for you—In my next—anent of Bull Run—I mention Mrs. Johnson &amp; her sister, (though not by name)—will be out next Thursday—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I am scratching this off at the Mercantile Library in 10th st. Philadelphia (though I date 
        home in Camden) &amp; will have to close to get it in the box in time for the carrier.
      </p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, dear, dear Nelly—</span>
