It was a proper thing for you to do &amp; it became you well The more one reads &amp; knows of Carlyle the more one loves &amp; reverences him. He was worth all other Britains put together to me. What have we to do with his opinions? He was a towering &amp; god like man &amp; that was enough. He is to be judged as a poet &amp; prophet, &amp; not as a molder of opinion.

I do not think his trip hammer with the Aeolian attachment figure conceived in the highest spirit. It is so preposterous &amp; impossible that it spoils it for me, but it raps
