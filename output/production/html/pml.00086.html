                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">
                Yesterday was indeed a day, for almost every post brought me despatches in your familiar hand which it always gives me a thrill to see.
                First came the two postcards, then the copy of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Specimen Days</span> &amp; the Camden paper, last the letter which I found waiting on returning at midnight 
                from a journalistic excursion to Fleet Street—where I completed an account of a great fire which has been raging just opposite here in a timber wharf
                for two days &amp; nights,—a most lurid spectacle, with the old Thames as reflector!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                I must not decide off-hand about the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Specimen Days</span>,—that is, whether to make two vols. as you suggest, or to try
                &amp; get the whole into one. In the latter case, the book would be rather crowded. We put much less into most of the 'Camelots,' than there is in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">
                King Arthur</span>, &amp; give them much larger print, &amp; I want to have you shewn as brightly &amp; impressively as possible in point of typography, &amp;c.
                On the other hand the publishers might not be willing to issue the 2nd vol., supposing we divide, very soon. I will consult with Gordon<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> to-day, &amp; you shall hear
                at once when the matter is settled.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                I do hope that by this you have decided to send off the extra words of introduction! They would give the book an added "send" into the midst of our readers &amp; do a deal of good so. But I know how things
                are with you, &amp; do not want to give you more trouble than can be helped. For the two addtional photos, many, may thanks! I will see what Gordon says about putting
                the portrait in at p. 122. In such a cheap series we have to be careful about first cost &amp; this hampers us very much.—
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
               No! I would not think of putting the copy of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Specimen Days</span> with your corrections into the printer's hands and will get copies 
                from Wilson of Glasow<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>, carefully following all your deletions &amp; so on. It is one of the greatest prizes I possess, &amp; someday a sense of its value will
               inspire me, I'm afraid, to beg you to send me a copy of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span> too with your name in it, (&amp; mine, as proof of ownership) &amp; 
                some further inscription as well. You see what it is to give the inch; now I am coolly asking the ell. Most of all
                though, I feel very powerfully impelled to come over to the States this year, for myself. Dr. Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">3</a> pressed me to do so again last week, &amp; things have been working in that direction
                for some time now. W. S. Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">4</a> has asked me to stay with him too, &amp; there are other friends. If I came, I should have to send letters to the papers here, &amp; 
                perhaps lecture too, to pay my way; for you know the usual straits of a young scribe! I come to my last halfpenny indeed almost every week, &amp; am getting quite 
                used to the condition at last. It educates one's faculties &amp; sympathies tremendously.
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
             I expect Gordon will send off the ten guineas at once. I ask him to do so to-day. They shall be sent by P. O. order as you direct to 328 Mickle St.
            </p>

                    education, the Scottish editor soon became a driving force in the company's
                    success, creating some of its most well-known editions, such as the Canterbury
                    Poets Series, the Camelot Classics Series, the Great Writers Series, and the
                    Contemporary Science Series. Whitman's 1886 English edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Scott and advertised by Rhys as

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
