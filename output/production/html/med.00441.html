        <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I send you a piece printed here to give a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">true</span> statement of the situation—&amp; which I should be 
        well satisfied to have printed in Britain. I ought to have written you before. I have read your "Shakspere"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; ought to have thanked you for it. I find it full of vitality &amp; suggestiveness, on themes that 
        might be supposed exhausted years ago—but are not at all exhausted.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">As I write I am feeling pretty comfortable—much the same as for last two years—no worse.
        John Burroughs was here with me last week. He is well. …<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">M D Conway has called upon us. He is a good &amp; intellectual man, but I don't think I either got hold of him, 
        nor he of me, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">at all</span>. My friend, I must still put off for another letter some things I have had in my mind 
        for months to say to you. Your letters past—what John Burroughs told me—(and your Shakspere book)—have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grafted</span> you more on my good will &amp; memory than you perhaps know. I write in haste.

                    <p class="tei_p">This letter must have been written about the same time as the one to William
                        Michael Rossetti (dated <a href="prc.00033">January 26, 1876</a>), for
                        the following reasons: Whitman referred to the article in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">West Jersey Press</span>, to Burroughs' visit in the middle
                        of January, and to Conway's recent interview. Dowden apparently replied to
                        this letter on <a href="loc.01496">February 16, 1876</a>. However,
                        Dowden's letter on <a href="loc.01495">February 6, 1876</a>, also
                        noted receipt of a communication referring to his book on Shakespeare.</p>

                    for the first eighty pages but only sporadically after that, although there are
                    underlined passages throughout the entire volume. The underscoring in various
                    kinds of pencils and comments dated in the 1880s indicate that Whitman examined
                    Dowden's study several times. Whitman had praised the book's opening chapters in
                    his <a href="med.00437">May 2, 1875</a> letter to John Burroughs. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00441_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="med.00441_n3"><span>Probably at this point
