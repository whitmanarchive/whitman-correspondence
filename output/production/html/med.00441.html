        <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I send you a piece printed here to give a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">true</span> statement of the situation—&amp; which I should be 
        well satisfied to have printed in Britain. I ought to have written you before. I have read your "Shakspere" &amp; ought to have thanked you for it. I find it full of vitality &amp; suggestiveness, on themes that 
        might be supposed exhausted years ago—but are not at all exhausted.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">As I write I am feeling pretty comfortable—much the same as for last two years—no worse.
        John Burroughs was here with me last week. He is well. …
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">M D Conway has called upon us. He is a good &amp; intellectual man, but I don't think I either got hold of him, 
        nor he of me, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">at all</span>. My friend, I must still put off for another letter some things I have had in my mind 
        for months to say to you. Your letters past—what John Burroughs told me—(and your Shakspere book)—have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grafted</span> you more on my good will &amp; memory than you perhaps know. I write in haste.
      </p>
