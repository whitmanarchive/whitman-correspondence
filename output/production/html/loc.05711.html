                <span class="tei_salute"> My Dearest Friend:
                </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> Those few words of yours to Herby "tasted good" to us—few, but enough, seeing that we can fill out
                between the lines with what you have given us of yourself forever &amp; always in
                your books—&amp; that is how I comfort myself for having so few letters. But I
                turn many wistful thoughts toward America, and were not I &amp; mine bound here by
                unseverable ties, did we not seem to grow &amp; belong here as by a kind of natural
                destiny that has to be fulfilled very cheerfully, could I make America my home for
                the sake of being near you in body as I am in heart &amp; soul—but Time has
                good things in store for us sooner or later, I doubt not. I could hardly express to
                you how welcome is the thought of death to me—not in the sense of any
                discontent with life—but as life with fresh energies &amp; wider horizon &amp;
                hand in hand again with those that are gone on first. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Herby found the little bit of gray cloth very useful—but one day <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">save him an
                old suit</span>. Your figure in the picture is, I think, a fair suggestion of one aspect of
                you; but not, could not of course be, an adequate portrait. He will never rest till
                he has done his best to achieve that. As soon as he can afford it (for it is a very
                slow business indeed for a young artist to make money in England, though when he
                does begin he is better paid than in America) he means to run over to see you. He
                says he should like always to spend his winters in New York. I say how very highly I
                prize that last slip you sent me, "A backward glance on my own road"? It both corroborates &amp; explains much that I feel
                very deeply.—If you are seeing Mrs. Whitman, please say
                her letter was a pleasure &amp; that I shall write again before very long. I feel as
                if this letter would never find you—be sure &amp; let us know your
                whereabouts. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Remembrance &amp; love. </p>
