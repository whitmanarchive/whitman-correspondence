                    Louis was in political turmoil. Under the new state constitution of August 1875,
                    St. Louis adopted a city charter on August 22, 1876, which abolished the
                    independent state Board of Water Commissioners and replaced it with a city Board
                    of Public Improvements, a change similar to that made in Brooklyn in 1872 (see
                    the letter from Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on <a href="loc.00457">December 8, 1872</a>). Because of a series of legal
                    challenges, the charter did not go into effect until April 1877, and the new
                    Board was not appointed until August. The discredited political appointees of
                    1875 were apparently striking a final vindictive blow against Jeff before they
                    were replaced under the new law. Nonetheless, the city council appointed Jeff as
                    water commissioner on August 21 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Journal of the City

                    Estimate of Walt Whitman" (1870), left her home in England in 1876 to offer
                    herself, body and soul, to the man she had envisioned from reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. In the poetry the Whitman persona spoke
                    boldly of begetting "far more arrogant republics" ("Song of Myself"), but in
                    dealing with Mrs. Gilchrist's passion Whitman was timid and evasive. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00475_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00475_n5"><span>Whitman's letter of
                    about July 21 is not extant. The poet undoubtedly informed Jeff that Louisa's
