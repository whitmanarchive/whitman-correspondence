               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I am here at the bedside of your friend Babbitt in the Mason Hospital.  I read him your letter; and he wishes me to say to you that he would be glad to answer your letters to him if he was able.  He is in about the same condition he has been in for three months.  He wishes to go home to his friends in Barre, and could get his discharge, but Dr. Bliss, of the Armory Square Hospital, neglects to send on his descriptive list, although the surgeon here has written to him for it.  No doubt you can see to having it sent.  Mr. Babbitt's father, who has been out with the 53rd, is going out again, and he is anxious to get his son home before he leaves.  The descriptive list is the only thing necessary now to procure his discharge.  Your friend wishes you to see Dr. Bliss, and write to him what he says about it.  I shall come and see him whenever I come to town.  What he needs is sympathizing friends around him.  He is very lonesome lying here with no Walt Whitman to cheer him up.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been to see about getting together a package of books for you, but the booksellers are so busy it will be several days before I can get them packed and sent.  Let me hear from you.  I write in haste with numb fingersâ€”it is bitter cold here today.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer tei_closer_rend_right">
               <span class="tei_salute">Yours</span>
               <span class="tei_signed">J. T. Trowbridge</span>
