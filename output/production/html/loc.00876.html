            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> am here at the bedside of your friend Babbitt<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in the Mason Hospital.  I read him your letter; and he wishes me to say to you that he would be glad to answer your letters to him if he was able.  He is in about the same condition he has been in for three months.  He wishes to go home to his friends in Barre, and could get his discharge, but Dr. Bliss,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> of the Armory Square Hospital, neglects to send on his descriptive list, although the surgeon here has written to him for it.  No doubt you can see to having it sent.  Mr. Babbitt's father, who has been out with the 53rd, is going out again, and he is anxious to get his son home before he leaves.  The descriptive list is the only thing necessary now to procure his discharge.  Your friend wishes you to see Dr. Bliss, and write to him what he says about it.  I shall come and see him whenever I come to town.  What he needs is sympathizing friends around him.  He is very lonesome lying here with no Walt Whitman to cheer him up.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been to see about getting together a package of books for you, but the booksellers are so busy it will be several days before I can get them packed and sent.  Let me hear from you.  I write in haste with numb fingers—it is bitter cold here today.</p>

                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
                    gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry Boy and the
                        Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
                    had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the <a href="nar.00002">January 10,
                    1863</a>. Though
                    Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every
                    year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and
                    greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A.
                    Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>,
                    23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman

                    stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
                    D. O'Connor. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00876_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00876_n2"><span>As Whitman informed Mrs.
                    Curtis in a letter from <a href="loc.00801">October 28, 1863</a>, Caleb
                    Babbitt suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square
                    Hospital. According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library),
                    Babbitt had been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left
                    Washington on furlough. On <a href="nyp.00143">August 18, 1863</a>,
                    Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre,
                    Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary
                    acknowledged Whitman's letter on <a href="nyp.00145">September 6,
                    1863</a>, and wrote that Caleb was "not quite as well as when I wrote you
                    before…he wishes me to tell you to keep writing…for your letters do him more
                    good than a great deal of medicine." On <a href="nyp.00146">September 18,
                        1863</a>, at the expiration of his forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong
                    enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to imagine you talking
                    with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well to think about, but
                    it is nothing compared with the original." On <a href="nyp.00148">October
                        18, 1863</a>, Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in
                    my pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he
                    mentioned his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On <a href="nyp.00150">October 26, 1863</a>, S. H. Childs wrote for Caleb from
                    the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He Is unable to set up &amp;
                    suffers considerable pain In his
                    head."

                    (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
                    was in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to

                    Washington after the war; see the letter from Whitman to Hiram Sholes of <a href="loc.01565">May 30, 1867</a>. When a pension for Whitman was
                    proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was quoted: "I am of
                    opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during the war
                    accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr. Whitman"
