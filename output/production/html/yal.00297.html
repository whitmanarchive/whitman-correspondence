                    familiar poems in the foreign tongue I have so long been reading. I seemed to

                    &amp; I also imagined this as but the beginning of a long pilgrimage you are to

                    yourself much of the time. Do come &amp; stay two weeks if you can. We have no
                    girl (servant) to bore us. I am a little nobody, but I reverence you, &amp; that
                    sheds a little borrowed greatness on me.</p>

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
