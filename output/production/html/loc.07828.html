                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
                    the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the

                    is most likely the famous <a href="loc.04201">August 3, 1890</a>, letter
                    from Symonds, to which Whitman probably responded on <a href="loc.02142">August 19, 1890</a>, though only a draft of the poet's letter survives.
                    However, Whitman also promised to pass along "an older letter" from Symonds in
                    his <a href="loc.07831">August 24, 1890</a>, letter to Bucke. The older
                    letter would probably be Symonds' passionate letter of <a href="loc.04191">December 9, 1889</a>, which prefigured Symonds's August 3rd letter.
                    Whitman mentioned this older letter in his <a href="loc.07741">December
                        25–26 1889</a>, letter to Bucke. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
