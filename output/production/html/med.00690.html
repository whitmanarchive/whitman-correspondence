            <p class="tei_p">Yours rec'd with the good 10—God bless you—I half-moped along all through
                February, but am coming round, same as before—I go down three or four days at
                a time to my friends the Staffords, &amp; get out in the woods a great deal—It
                is only half an hour's journey—go again Friday if it dont storm<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—Should have come up there with you
                a month ago, but was hardly able—I got a bad chill six weeks ago, struck
                in—(was quite well up to that time)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">don't contain</span> the slip about the Emerson business
                you allude to<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—The just published Carlyle <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences</span> so well &amp; strongly praised in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> &amp; every where,
                don't confirm or add to my estimation of C—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Much the

            <p class="tei_p">Kennedey comes here quite often &amp; is
                disposed to be friendly—I guess he is a pretty good man, but has <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the fever called literature</span> &amp; I shouldn't wonder if he
                was in for it, for life<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—Lathrop<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> has visited me—very pleasant—Shall be glad

                    Nathaniel Hawthorne. Whitman received a letter from Lathrop on March 23 (lost)
                    inviting him to come to Boston to give his lecture on Lincoln (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book). According to Kennedy, Lathrop was in Philadelphia on March 8
                    in order to arrange for Whitman's lecture (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of

                    the poet for the first time on <a href="loc.03230">April 20, 1878</a>. On
                    March 31, 1885, he urged Whitman to give a reading from his own poetry in order
                    to raise funds in aid of international copyright laws (Charles E. Feinberg
