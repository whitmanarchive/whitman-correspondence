            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours rec'd with the good 10—God bless you—I half-moped along all through
                February, but am coming round, same as before—I go down three or four days at
                a time to my friends the Staffords, &amp; get out in the woods a great deal—It
                is only half an hour's journey—go again Friday if it dont storm—Should have come up there with you
                a month ago, but was hardly able—I got a bad chill six weeks ago, struck
                in—(was quite well up to that time)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">don't contain</span> the slip about the Emerson business
                you allude to—The just published Carlyle <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences</span> so well &amp; strongly praised in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> &amp; every where,
                don't confirm or add to my estimation of C—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Much the
                        contrary</span>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Kennedey comes here quite often &amp; is
                disposed to be friendly—I guess he is a pretty good man, but has <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the fever called literature</span> &amp; I shouldn't wonder if he
                was in for it, for life—Lathrop has visited me—very pleasant—Shall be glad
                to supply you with a set of books of course—I have plenty yet—</p>
