            <p class="tei_p">A glorious day outside—Han is resting quietly on the sofa, Lou
                had so nicely had repaired. She had a serious time yesterday—on the floor with pain. I 
                obtained a nurse, for my time was occupied in procuring remedies—all day—until 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">allmost​ </span><span class="tei_corr">almost​
        
      </span></span> night. I was on the run, without food sufficient 
                to sustain me. I was quite broken down—famished and most irritable—completely 
                prostrated myself. Han must have her mattress made over. The woman who attemped to make up 
                her bed—could not succeed satisfactorially. It will cost but 
                5.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">50</span>—will be called for at 9 o'clock

                and returned at 5 as good as new. It cost me 20 dollars cash, in Myrtle Av, Brooklyn.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I'm not selling any paintings yet I have some fine ones, could I but get away them—to 
                Adirondack, but that is impossible—Han says you will, or can make it all right. You must not criticise me, Walt—Mother Whitman 
                had great faith, sympathy, and respect—for me. I have improved this property more than 
                1000$—by my personal industry.</p>
