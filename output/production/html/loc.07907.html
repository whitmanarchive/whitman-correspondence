                to hand last ev'g. I was, and am, much concerned to hear such poor accounts of your health
                but a good deal relieved to find that the worst symptoms had passed off for the 
                present—hope they will stay away

                brought against me for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slander</span> by a discharged employee 
                (a young woman) the case has gone against
                me—verdict is: "For Plantiff—Damages $500." Remains to be seen what stand 
                the government will take—whether
                they will support me and how far—there <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">may be</span> also 
                question of appeal. What I did &amp; said was done
                and said entirely as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Med. Supt.</span> and my judgement and conscienece 
                still tell me (as they told me all

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    and writer of historical fiction; the young Mitchell looked in on Whitman when
                    his regular physician, William Osler, was unavailable. Whitman was not overly
                    impressed with the Mitchells: "The young man Mitchell did not take me by
                    storm—he did not impress me. I start off with a prejudice against doctors
                    anyway. I know J. K.'s father somewhat—Weir: he is of the intellectual
                    type—a scholar, writer, and all that: very good—an adept: very
                    important in his sphere—a little bitter I should say—a little
                    bitter—touched just a touch by the frosts of culture, society,
