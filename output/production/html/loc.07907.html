            <p class="tei_p">Your postcard of the 13<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> came 
                to hand last ev'g. I was, and am, much concerned to hear such poor accounts of your health
                but a good deal relieved to find that the worst symptoms had passed off for the 
                present—hope they will stay away
                for awhile. Shall look out for Feb. N.A. Review.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have some bad news to tell you. I have been in court the last two days (all Wednesday 
                and Thursday)—an action was
                brought against me for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slander</span> by a discharged employee 
                (a young woman) the case has gone against
                me—verdict is: "For Plantiff—Damages $500." Remains to be seen what stand 
                the government will take—whether
                they will support me and how far—there <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">may be</span> also 
                question of appeal. What I did &amp; said was done
                and said entirely as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Med. Supt.</span> and my judgement and conscienece 
                still tell me (as they told me all
                along) that my action has been what it should have been
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00233.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00233.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00233.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must have been</span> under all the
                circumstances—this being so I am comparatively indifferent 
                as to what
                happens as consequence. Show this to Horace, I 
                shall send you the newspapers in the case and show them to Horace too. We are 
                all well—my arm (shoulder) no longer gives me
                any pain or much annoyance. Am comfortable, have a good appetite and feel 
                hearty—all well at house—all goes well with meter—I am
                not uneasy but that every thing will turn out well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt—if this bladder trouble returns and is bad will you not send for 
                young Mitchell (D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>) and take such steps for relief as
                he advises? I wish you would—I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> his advice 
                will be good and that you will obtain relief by following it</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">With much love</span>
