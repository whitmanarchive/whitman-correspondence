            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">After ascertaining from Frederick Locker-L. that
                    Tennyson was still staying at Haslemere, I posted your
                portrait to him last Monday and received an acknowledgement from Hallam this morning with a letter for you, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wch</span>​  I direct and forward with this.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I received your welcome letter of October the 22<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">nd</span>—I rejoice that you and my friends at Glendale
                continue in such excellent health—I should indeed have enjoyed the drive with
                you that you suggest in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr</span>​  letter—quite pleasant to think of. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Poor Frederick Locker-Lampson is suffering from "an
                obstinate attack of rheumatism," he is at Bath; but his daughter M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span> Lionel Tennyson tells me
                that he is coming to London soon. I posted your present to M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span>. Tennyson (as bade me to) last Monday and I have heard of its safe
                arrival since: L said in a letter to me "how kind of Walt Whitman to give me his
                poems" or some such remark: this rather languid swell has grown very friendly to you
                and I may add myself!—as we say here in school-boy fashion <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Locker-Lampson​ ">Locker-L</span>​  is a "very decent chap"! and a distinct success from his own "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">West-end</span>" point of view.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is foggy, smoky and dark this morning at the a.m. o.c. and I am scribbling this
                instead of painting—oh, how often I think of American "air full of sheen &amp;
                oxygen" as compared to this groggy London fog, alas. What a wonder it is that we are
                a great people and that there are Englishmen with good tempers!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Ernest Rhys must I should fear be having a rough time of
                it on the Atlantic he sailed last Saturday—I have given him M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span>. Paul's address where I expect he will stay.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose my portrait and one for Morse. I like it because I
                look in it as if I meant to paint or do my best in that direction!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my regards to all enquiring friends especially Tom Harnard and also to M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span> Davies.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> A stream of people continue to call on Sunday afternoon to see your
                portrait—and general approbation is continued to </p>
