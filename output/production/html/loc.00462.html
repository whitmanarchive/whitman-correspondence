            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote you a few days since about Mattie</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The next day I saw in one of the papers here that you were confined to your room with sickness—is this true? I have written mother again this morning—there is no particular change in Mattie—I have been able to take her out for about an hour's drive for the last three days—this helps her more than anything else</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In writing you I spoke to you about coming on—I also mentioned it to Mother—since then I have wondered if—supposing you to feel pretty good—you could'nt come by way of Philadelphia and bring Mother with you  Mat seems to want to see you two so very very much</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will write or telegraph you if any change occurs before I hear from you</p>
