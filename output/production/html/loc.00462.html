                    tersely noted, "Walt Whitman is ill with paralysis." Walt Whitman's sad letter
                    of February 8 made clear both his affection for Mattie and the serious nature of
                    his illness: "Dear, dear, dear, sister Matty—O how I have been thinking of
                    you, &amp; shall all day—I have not now the use of my limbs to move from
                    one room to the other—or else I should come on immediately to St.
                    Louis...Your unhappy, sorrowful, loving brother" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed.,
