            <p class="tei_p">It is a perfect Spring day. Bright and not too warm. I have been out about the garden
                and grounds nearly all day a good part of the day your old friend Norman
                    Mackenzie was with me (he is spending the Sunday
                here—is on his way home from Toronto—been there for his "2<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> intermediate" law examination—which he
                passed—he has now studied law 3 years and has 2 more to study). Norman and I
                had a good deal to talk about you Norman says he remembers you and all you did and
                said (when he knew you in '80—he being then 12 years old) as well as if it was
                only a week <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00582.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00582.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00582.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>ago. He remarked that there must be something extraordinary about you to cause
                you to be remembered in this persistent manner. He is a very fine boy and greatly liked.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Your card of 9<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> came to hand yesterday—I hope you
                will send me word (as you get it) about O'C., poor fellow I
                fear he is very sick. I hope he is not suffering much.
                We must make up our minds to lose him, I do trust however he will not have much pain
                or suffering to bear. I hope you have been out in your chair. If you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">could</span> only get out once or twice a day for a short time
                surely it would be a wonderful relief to you from the dreadful monotony of your life
                the last eleven months. Be sure and let me know how you get on with the chair.</p>
