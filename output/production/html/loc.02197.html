                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt;</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is a long time since I have heard from you or word of you: though I have had one
                short note from Ernest Rhys, it is true, who spoke of you; &amp; of your being
                somewhat under the weather.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We all liked your brief letter about the President—&amp; our Friend—Mr.
                    Forman spoke of it the other evening as "very nice."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It seemed to me to eminate from someone who felt pretty brisk.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You find E. Rhys a good fellow—I am heartily glad
                he is getting on so well in the States—at least he seems to be entering into
                the fun of a winter there.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last Friday evening I created a chalk &amp; charcoal portrait of Buxton Forman: he
                was delightful with it &amp; so was his wife, for whom it was a birthday present. He
                has a good characteristic head and I enjoyed making it very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Once a week H.B. Forman is Clerk-in-Waiting at the General Post Office &amp; on those
                evenings in comfortable office lit with electric light I made the portrait.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am in the evening now planning out this large reception w 33 friends to see your
                portrait, that I spoke of in my last letter.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If any names &amp; addresses of friends occur to you, that you would like me to ask,
                send them in your next. I have already got a good many of your friends' addresses
                but the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">last batch</span> of subscribers through the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pall Mall Gazette</span> I have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span>
                got. Mrs. Rosamund Powell (a friend of L. Morgan Brown's) sends
                (£3) through me in this letter her annual subscription (free will offering) to
                you. Let me know if you get this all-right?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Give my kind rememberances to Morse, when you are writing, I expect to show his bust
                along with my others works at this reception in April.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Carpenter is well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mont S. has been very ill as you must have heard.</p>
