            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is a long time since I have heard from you or word of you: though I have had one
                short note from Ernest Rhys, it is true, who spoke of you; &amp; of your being
                somewhat under the weather.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We all liked your brief letter about the President—&amp; our Friend—Mr.
                    Forman<a href="#n0240" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0240">1</a> spoke of it the other evening as "very nice."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It seemed to me to eminate from someone who felt pretty brisk.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You find E. Rhys<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> a good fellow—I am heartily glad
                he is getting on so well in the States—at least he seems to be entering into
                the fun of a winter there.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last Friday evening I created a chalk &amp; charcoal portrait of Buxton Forman: he
                was delightful with it &amp; so was his wife, for whom it was a birthday present. He
                has a good characteristic head and I enjoyed making it very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Once a week H.B. Forman is Clerk-in-Waiting at the General Post Office &amp; on those
                evenings in comfortable office lit with electric light I made the portrait.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am in the evening now planning out this large reception w 33 friends to see your
                portrait, that I spoke of in my last letter.</p>

                    Harry Buxton Forman, was most notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley
                    and John Keats. On <a href="loc.01619">February 21, 1872</a>, Buxton sent
                    a copy of R. H. Horne's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Great Peace-Maker: A Sub-marine
                        Dialogue</span> (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying
                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
