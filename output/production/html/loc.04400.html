                pleasant &amp; grateful to me. He sits alongside the table as I write reading a

                to have an opportunity of seeing you shortly. (Have asked him to come to Camden with

            <p class="tei_p">Have had a splendid day for my sail down the Hudson, &amp; have enjoyed it from
                beginning to end.—The beautiful &amp; luxuriously fitted steamboat was itself
                extremely interesting to begin with—Then the noble river with its beautiful
                banks on each side, of continually varying interest &amp; beauty during the whole
                sail. The clear blue sky, the light clouds on the horizon shadowing the hills, the
                cool delicious air, were all stimulating &amp; enjoyable. I struck up quite a
                friendship too with a young Massachusetts Doctor,<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">4</a> &amp; we "chummed" together as far

            <p class="tei_p">Finally the arrival at New York. (Desbrosses St.) I doubt if anyone ever entered New
                York under more favourable &amp; beautiful circumstances—The long, beautiful
                sail approaching it, culminating at the moment of arrival at our first stopping
                place—22nd Street—with a sunset of the most delicate loveliness, &amp;
                wide-arching amplitude—the sky flecked with cirrus clouds glowing warm golden
                on the underside, delicate pearl above—the reflections in the river,—the
                rapidly moving &amp; multitudinous boat ferries &amp;c,—the cities on each
                bank—the wharves &amp; steamers—all made up a living picture I shall

                the distance.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then in the Annex boat to Brooklyn in the dusk, the Bridge lit along its whole course
                with lamps—Landing,—the Vanderbilt Avenue car, stopping about a block
                from here,—&amp; arrival here, Mr Rome looking out for me at the gate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A good letter from Traubel<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">5</a> awaiting me tells me that

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
