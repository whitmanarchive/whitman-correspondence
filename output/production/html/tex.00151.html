            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got a letter last Saturday as well as the previous Wednesday—I am better than I was last week—not as well as I would like to be, but well enough to keep on with my work, &amp;c. just the same as ever—I feel real well, sometimes, for a day—but then comes the trouble in the head again—Did you get the "Galaxy" of Dec. 1st? I think it a very good piece. Every thing here in the office goes on as usual. I got your letter, mother. I wrote to Han last week. It is beautiful weather here to-day—I have got my new trowsers—$20!!—only think of that!—it is lucky I wear my clothes a long while—</p>
