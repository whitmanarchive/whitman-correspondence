         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> am in great trouble again and of course must write to you about it.  I was in Washington the 2nd and I went to No 34 4 ½ Street and pawned my Watch a good American Lever, for $22.07 which I was to pay within a month but I was robbed of my pocket Book which contained a receipt which he gave me for the wach  now I want you to go there if you will and see the man (I dont know his name) and if the thief has not already been there and got the wach I want you to tell him not to let any one have it on that receipt.  I will soon be there myself and redeem it for I am going to be discharged within a few days when I will come and see you.  You will confer a great favor on me by going at once to see about it.  I would like to have the fellow arrested if he should bring the ticket for the Wach for I had another Stole from me at the same time.  Write to me as soon as you find out about the Wach for I am very anxious about it.  I dont want to loose both Waches  I have written this in a great hurry.  write to me soon from your good friend</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is No 34 4 ½ St.</p>

                    Whitman on June 1, 1889: "Do you remember the young man of the 5th U S Cavalary
                    who you used to visit in Armory Square Hospital and the many times you used to
                    take me into a Restaurant and give me a good square meal. I suppose you done
                    that to so many you would hardly remember me by that. for all Soldiers know[n]
                    to you looked upon you as their friend, for you ever wore your heart on your
                    sleeve to Old Soldier boys. You used to call me Cody then. . . . In the years
                    gone by I have often passed through Camden, and had I have known it was your
                    home I should surely have stopped to see you, that I might once more have
                    grasped you by the hand and looked into that kindly face and fought over our
                    battles (once again) in Washington" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection, the Library
                    of Congress). Walt Whitman's reply of June 9, 1889 is lost. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
