            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">My brother does not get on quite as well as I had anticipated.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a>  Yet I still hold to the judgment in my previous letter. He has been, &amp; is, very sick—has had improved spells, &amp; then goes down again. To-day he is in the latter condition.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">William, I received the letter, with Ramsdells note.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> 
                Also Allen's. (Also the first letter soon after my arrival here.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As to Allen,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> refusing &amp;c. giving his views, reasons, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
                it is perhaps one of those services to a thing, (precious, rare 
                &amp; precious, in philosophy, &amp; life too,) rendered by showing not only how that 
                thing appears from the point of view of intensest vermin &amp; filth, exclusively, 
                but of vermin &amp; filth diluted with shallowness to the last degree that life will bear.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">If my brother does not get worse, &amp; no crisis takes place, 
                I think, (as at present intending) I shall leave for Washington Wednesday morning next.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is well, (considering). All the rest are first rate. 
                Jeff is in St. Louis. Nelly, I send you my true love, my darling.

                    Whitman wrote that his brother George was ill with "malignant erysipelas, with
                    great swelling, sores, &amp; for a while complete blindness." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00264_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00264_n4"><span>H. J. Ramsdell was a
                    clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E. Huntington Library, San Marino, California), Walt
                    Whitman called him "chief clerk." In the 1869 Directory, he was listed as a
                    correspondent. On <a href="loc.01829">May 8, 1867</a>, Ramsdell reported
                    the high praise that George Townsend, the journalist (1841–1914), accorded
                    to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius," "the song of a God." In his <a href="loc.01830">July 17, 1867</a> letter, he asked Walt Whitman to do
                    whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho, against whom charges had
                    been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward D. Holbrook
                    (1836–1870). Actually, on July 12, 1867, Walt Whitman had submitted to the
                    Attorney General a "Report on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Charges</span> submitted by
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. E. D. Holbrook</span>, Del[egate] from Idaho
                    Terr[itory], <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">against</span>
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. Milton Kelly</span>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
                    Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
                    in Walt Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by Stanbery but
                    written by Walt Whitman, dated July 20, 1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding
                    Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp; ordered to stand as the decision of this
                    Office in the Case, so far as now presented." On <a href="loc.01832">July
                        22, 1867</a>, Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness." (Ramsdell's
                    letters are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) Judge Kelly wrote to
                    Walt Whitman on June (?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on <a href="yal.00125">August 9, 1867</a>. On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell,
                    among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow (1832–1896), Secretary of the
                    Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be appointed to a position in the Treasury
                    Department" (National Archives). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00264_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00264_n5"><span>On May 9, O'Connor wrote:
                    "I enclose a letter I got from that child of a burnt father, Allen…It is
                    truly Pecksniffian, and seems to have been written on all-fours. You will see
                    that it ends the matter of publishing the book, and he doesn't say a word about
                    John Burroughs' book…I think, on the whole, it is probably altogether best
                    that Carleton should have nothing to do with 'Leaves of Grass,' though I would
                    well enough like to have him publish the 'Notes' " (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.; Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.73.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996],
                    3:521–522). George W. Carleton was a New York publisher, and Henry Stanley
                    Allen was evidently associated with him, since the 1867 Directory listed them at
                    the same business address. In 1864 O'Connor had suggested Carleton as the
                    publisher of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>; see Trowbridge's <a href="loc.00875">February 12, 1864</a> letter to Walt Whitman. In 1865
                    O'Connor proposed to George William Curtis (1824–1892) the editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Weekly</span>, that he write to Carleton about the
                    publication of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span>; see Horace Traubel,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.33.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> (1906–1996), 1:86. Since
                    O'Connor was not successful in either attempt, it is surprising that he once
                    again sought to interest Carleton in publication schemes. See also Miller, ed.,
