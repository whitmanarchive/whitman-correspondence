                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">My brother does not get on quite as well as I had anticipated.  Yet I still hold to the judgment in my previous letter. He has been, &amp; is, very sick—has had improved spells, &amp; then goes down again. To-day he is in the latter condition.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">William, I received the letter, with Ramsdells note. 
                Also Allen's. (Also the first letter soon after my arrival here.)</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As to Allen, refusing &amp;c. giving his views, reasons, &amp;c. &amp;c. 
                it is perhaps one of those services to a thing, (precious, rare 
                &amp; precious, in philosophy, &amp; life too,) rendered by showing not only how that 
                thing appears from the point of view of intensest vermin &amp; filth, exclusively, 
                but of vermin &amp; filth diluted with shallowness to the last degree that life will bear.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">If my brother does not get worse, &amp; no crisis takes place, 
                I think, (as at present intending) I shall leave for Washington Wednesday morning next.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother is well, (considering). All the rest are first rate. 
                Jeff is in St. Louis. Nelly, I send you my true love, my darling.
            </p>
