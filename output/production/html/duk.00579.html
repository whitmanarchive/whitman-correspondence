            <p class="tei_p">your letter has come
            to day all right i looked some for it yester<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">day</span>
            but its just as well to day) i havent had
            any letter from jeff nor matty since i wrote
            last to you but as you have had one from
            Jeffy i suppose they are about the same)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeffy was to send a draft to George the first
            of the month for two hundred dollars
            but it has
            not come to my kno<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">w</span>legee
                without mr Lane has sent it on to George i expect him
            home to morrow or next day i hope he will
            come as the doors of the house is not got
            yet smith
                works but seemes to depend
            wholly on George his loan was to be
            got to morrow on his house i dont know whether
            he will wait till george comes or not
            George said before he went away smith
            wouldent have got the money if he george
                hadent applied) they say quite a good many
                buildings in brooklyn has had to stop
            on account of not getting money on them
            i think ours will be so we can move about
            the first of may the walls are all done
            and the stairs up George wanted smith
            to get some more help to finish up he has
            but one man so far but if george comes
            he will see to it i suppose)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">well walter dear i went down to the post
                office and got the money
                and i have got lots
                of things for myself i thought now was my time
                well i have a new bonnet making not quite
                
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00579.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00579.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00579.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                
            so fashionable as the eagle advertises the
            new bonnets one was a love of a bonnet consisting
            of two yards of ribbon and a rosebud)
            well i think the hats is awful)
            well when i went to the post
            office it was in the forenoon i was some lame
            but i thought i would ride down to sand st
                and call and see mrs Brown i dident
            think it was quite so far but i found it
            and she was very glad indeed to see me
            got a nice dinner and made me stay
            i beleive its the first meal i have eaten
            away from home since i come from
            Burlington
            
            if Jeff and matt knew i had
            been to see mrs Brown they would cross
            me off their books
            so you mustent let on
                so i have had a letter from Charley hey<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">de</span>
            full as moderate as usuall rather more
                so he deplores his fate as usual says han
            is pretty well can use her two fore fingers
            some that she has very many drsses to make
            but wears nothing but ragged dresses
            i wish han had more exertion about hers<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">elf</span>
            i sent the money george gave me for her to
            get her things made if she couldent make them 
            herself) he says the doctor orders her to take
            salts every morning fore her blood as she is
            flushed in her face) he says she has commenced
            a letter to me maybee i shall get it some time
                i see by the paper exmayor Booth is to be the
                post master of Brooklyn) i make out a letter
            walter dear) mrs steers does remarkably well here
                she thinks she was fortunate to get this place)
            i am pretty well trying to favor myself for the
            coming 1 of may

i congratulate mrs Oconer
                for not having to move so you can go there and have tea
