                    2:367). April 14 fell on Wednesday in 1869, and the calendar date 14 and the day
                    of the week Wednesday are in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Neither Louisa's
                    most recent letter to Walt Whitman nor the letter she received from Walt, his
                    April 13?, 1869 letter, is extant. But her son George Washington Whitman's
                    receipt of a $200 bank draft from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman is
                    consistent with Jeff's expectation earlier that month that he would send the
                    draft on about April 5, 1869. See Jeff's <a href="loc.00454">April 5,
                        1869</a> letter to Walt. The year 1869 is also consistent with new
                    fashions in bonnets and the appointment of postmaster Samuel Booth, both of
                    which are reported by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> in spring

                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in

                    were smaller sizes with low crowns and narrow rims: feathers were out, lace and
                    flowers and ribbons were in, and the height of fashion for trimmings was striped

                    Whitman. Though Louisa too expressed annoyance with the Browns, she seems to
                    have achieved more cordial relations with the family after the departure of
                    Jeff, Mattie, and family to St. Louis in 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r17">back</a>]</li><li id="n12">12. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00575_n12 note" id="duk.00575_n12"><span>Hannah Louisa (Whitman)

                    lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
                    pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
