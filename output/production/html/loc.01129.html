                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's
                        Monthly</span> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Century</span>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
                    Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
                    Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Tribune</span>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
                    one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
                    delirium" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mountain County Herald</span> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
                    as correspondent of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York World</span> from 1860 to 1862.
                    In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
                    until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
                    next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
                    and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poets of America</span>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,

                    (1828–1885), widow to Alexander Gilchrist, and her four children Beatrice,
                    Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
                    pieces of criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "A Woman's

                    Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
                    love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
                    visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
                    a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
