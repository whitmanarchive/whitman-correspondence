                    23, 1870. The date "march 23" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, but
                    Richard Maurice Bucke marked the letter with a speculative month of May and the
                    year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with the month in Louisa's hand and
                    dated the letter March 23?, 1870 (see Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 2:367).
                    Bucke's date is incorrect, and his error originated in a misreading of Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman's March 18, 1870 letter to Louisa (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth
                    M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas
                        Jefferson Whitman</span> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984],
                    143). Jeff's month is hurried and trails off after the letters "Ma," so Bucke
                    misread Jeff's date as "Ma[y?]." Berthold and Price date Jeff's letter March and
                    transcribe his month "Mar" (143). This letter from Louisa is written on the
                    reverse of her son Jeff's letter. The month March is correct and is consistent
                    both with Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's return to St. Louis and with a
                    recent storm in Brooklyn. Mattie departed Brooklyn on March 14, 1870, and she
                    arrived in St. Louis on March 16 (see Louisa's <a href="hyb.00002">March 16,
                        1870</a> letter to Walt and Jeff's <a href="duk.00594">March 18,

                    (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
                    children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa

                    preceding Monday is unlikely to be from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman: if
                    such a letter existed, it is not extant. A March 14 letter from Mattie is
                    impossible as an enclosure because she departed Brooklyn for St. Louis on that
                    date (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="hyb.00002">March 16,
                        1870</a> letter to Walt Whitman). The more probable case is that the
                    phrase "within letter" refers to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's brief letter
                    on Mattie's arrival in St. Louis. Louisa's letter is written on the reverse of
                    Jeff's letter (see Jeff's <a href="duk.00594">March 18, 1870</a> letter to
                    Louisa). If Jeff's letter was mailed on March 18, it probably arrived in
                    Brooklyn on March 21, 1873 (Monday). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00593_n7 note" id="duk.00593_n7"><span>Martha Mitchell Whitman

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie had visited Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Brooklyn for

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    boarding in the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn in April
                    1860. The relationship between the Browns and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
                    family was often strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house
                    for five years. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman maintained a cordial relationship with
                    the Browns after Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman departed for
                    St. Louis. Years later Louisa called on Mrs. Brown and remarked to Walt Whitman,
                    "if Jeff and matt knew i had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their
                    books" (see her <a href="duk.00579">April 14, 1869</a> letter). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">10. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00593_n13 note" id="duk.00593_n13"><span>The man named Willie is

                    Brown's son Willie was married (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00514">February
