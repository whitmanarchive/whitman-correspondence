            <p class="tei_p">I was expecting to visit New York early this month, and intended to call and thank you for your beautiful 
                and valued gift of Hesperia—but finding I shall not go now for two or three weeks, I write to acknowledge the receipt of the poem and to say that when I come on, I shall personally call and pay my respects.</p>

                    with Cora Tappan (then Cora Hatch) in 1857. He mentioned her in his June 20,
                    1857 letter to Sarah Tyndale; see Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> (New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–1977), 1:42–44. Tappan, born in 1840 in Cuba, New York, was a
                    medium. At age ten, as she sat with slate and pencil in hand, "she lost external
                    consciousness, and on awaking she found her slate covered with writing." At
                    fourteen she was a public speaker, and at sixteen married Dr. B. F. Hatch, who
                    published and wrote an introduction to her <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Discourses on
                        Religion, Morals, Philosophy, and Metaphysics</span> (1858). In 1871, now Cora
                    Tappan, she published a collection of poems entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hesperia</span>; the section "Laus Natura" was dedicated to "Walt Whitman,
                    the Poet of Nature." See also Emma Hardinge, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Modern American
