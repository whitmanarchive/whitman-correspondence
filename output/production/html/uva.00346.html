            <p class="tei_p">I have been improving for the last two days, &amp; think I shall be up &amp; around soon, as well as ever—I have had the services of a good physician, who has allowed me to get well quite naturally—he decided that the only thing needing serious watching was the throat, &amp; had prepared if the disease there went beyond a certain point to call in a skilful New York doctor, for consultation, but fortunately we were saved the trouble—I felt a good deal like myself the most of yesterday, &amp; the same to-day—so I don't think I am hurrahing before I am out of the woods.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have a letter from my brother George, down to 18th inst. he was all safe.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> My mother &amp; folks are all well—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I rece'd the letter enveloped to me 25th—I sent a line to Wm O'Connor, 25th, which I suppose he rec'd—has Nelly gone yet? I shall write to her next time—remember me to Ashton<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> with friendship—also to Arnold Johnson<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> with sincere thanks &amp; tell him I am getting well—&amp; give my best respects &amp; thanks to Major Hapgood.</p>
