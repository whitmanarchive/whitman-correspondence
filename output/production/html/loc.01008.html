                    (2). The complete text reads: <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>
                    <span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> "One of the most beloved and tender hearted of the visitors at the
                    hospitals in Washington, is Walt. Whitman, author of Leaves of Grass. However
                    his "barbaric yawp" may sound over other roofs, it sends sweet music into the
                    sick wards of the Capital. A gentleman who accompanied him on several of his
                    visits, relates that his coming was greeted by the soldiers with unvarying
                    pleasure, and that he soothed the homesick boys so often seen there, with a
                    tenderness that no woman could excel. His friends say that he cured one or two
                    young soldiers who were dying of homesickness, by his sympathy and
                    loving-kindness. Dying of homesickness is no figure of speech, but a reality of
                    weekly occurrence in our army. To such invalids the religious tract, or the
                    mechanical consolations of theology, give no relief; not musty manna from the
                    church wilderness, but living waters of sympathy from the warm heart of man who
                    loves them is what they need to save them. And this they get from the rough
                    singer of Brooklyn. Walt. like other poets, is not excessively rich, and
                    therefore may not stay in Washington much longer; but as long as he can afford
                    to remain he means to keep at his self-elected and unpaid post, doing good to
                    the sick and wounded. What a pity that when so many thousands of dollars are
                    spent to but little purpose for this work that a hundred or two could not be
                    devoted to retain this efficient volunteer." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
