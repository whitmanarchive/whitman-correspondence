                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Harry</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours rec'd—I am just starting off a few miles out from Phila—probably a
                day or two only—will look up the book you require
                (if I can find one) soon as I come back—&amp; send you—I am ab't as
                usual—nothing very new—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Hank if I'd known you was coming home last Sunday would have come down Saturday
                &amp; staid till Monday any way—You say you wrote a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blue
                    letter</span> but didn't send it to me—dear boy the only way is to dash
                ahead and "whistle dull cares away"—after all <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">its​ </span><span class="tei_corr">it's​
        
      </span></span> mostly in one's self one
                gets blue &amp; not from outside—life is like the weather—you've got to
                take what comes, &amp; you

                     can make it all go pretty well if only think so (&amp; provide in
                reason for rain &amp; snow)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I wish it was so you could all your life come in &amp; see me often for an hour or
                two—You see I think I understand you better than any one—(&amp; like you
                more too)—(You may not fancy so, but it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">is</span>
                so)—&amp; I believe Hank there are many things, confidences, questions,

                yet broached—me the same—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—Have you read about Oscar Wilde?—He has been to see me &amp; spent an
                afternoon—He is a fine large handsome youngster—had the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good sense</span> to take a great fancy to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">me</span>!—I was invited to receptions in Phila. am'g
                the big bugs &amp; a grand dinner to him by Mr &amp; Mrs Childs—but did not go
                to any—Awful cold here, this is now the third day,—but you know all about <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that</span>—(you say you know you are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a great fool</span>—don't you know every 'cute fellow secretly knows that
                about himself—I do)—God bless you my darling boy—Keep a brave
