            <p class="tei_p">The American Mail has not come in yet—delayed probably by the
                gales we are having. We look forward anxiously to its arrival,
                hoping that it will bring tidings of continued improvement &amp; increasing strength.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The wind is blowing "great guns" as I write, yesterday &amp; today having been
                very stormy, with showers of
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02024_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02024_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02024_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                hail and rain.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Geo Humphreys came
                here on Saturday afternoon &amp; spent the afternoon &amp; evening with me. 
                We spent most of the time reading &amp; talking
                about you. I never had a more appreciative auditor. 
                I read quite a lot aloud, including nearly all the Preface to the 1855 edition,
                &amp; he seemed quite entranced, &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">thrilled</span> as if he were
                receiving a succession of electric shocks.—I happened to have a reprint of the Preface
                (given me by Dr Bucke) which I gave him.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02025_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02025_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02025_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I met a work mate of his the other week who told me
                what a powerful influence Humphreys has on his mates.
                "He has made new men of us" he said. He has gathered
                quite a large group round him—nicknamed "the School"—with 
                whom he talks on social questions &amp; incites to read—Carlyle
                for instance. He is the chief founder of what they call the 
                ["]Co-operative Commonwealth" in Bolton—socialistic in theory 
                &amp; aims—which began a few years
                ago with a capital of 10s/- &amp; &amp; is now prospering wonderfully. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.02026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.02026_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                Fifteen persons are regularly employed—weaving &amp;c—including 
                a few women—&amp; they are just purchasing new premises for which
                they are paying £1900!</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Humphreys is a very likeable fellow indeed—earnest
                &amp; active with a winning sympathy &amp; kindliness of manner
                very attractive to me. He is well read &amp; thoughtful
                &amp; is a man I am heartily glad to be friends with.
                I am sure that he will prove to be (as he has been in
                the past) a centre of beneficial influence to many others. And
                he is wonderfully advanced

                in his appreciation of L of G &amp; his love for their author.
                And he is "as proud as a dog with two tails" of the
                copy you sent him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a brief letter from Carpenter yesterday.
                He is at York just now &amp; very busy. He talks
                of coming here some time before long.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was at Johnston's last night for a short time.
                He was quite well after a busy day. The rest of
                the friends are all well &amp; moving along as usual.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is a great joy to me to write to you again
