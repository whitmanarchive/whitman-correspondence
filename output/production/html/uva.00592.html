            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Y'r note &amp; German paper rec'd—Thanks—I wrote you (same address as
                this) some ten weeks ago, that Rolleston, Ireland, had rec'd
                first proofs of the translation of L of G. from Switzerland, &amp; wished you to see
                them—I wrote to you to write &amp; confer with him (R)—but have no word f'm you—Did you receive my
                letter? or have you heard from R or from the proofs, or printer?—I fancy the
                trans: must be out, printed, by this time—I have nothing from R. now for a
                long, long while (with that exception)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am laid up in my sick room—essentially the sixth recurrence of my war
                paralysis—&amp; have been (two or three spells serious) for over seven
                months—but am now some easier &amp; freer. I am sitting up days most of the 
                time—diet on mutton-broth &amp; milk &amp; toast bread—am very feeble,
                cannot get across the room without assistance—have a nurse, a good, strong Canadian young man—my mentality ab't the same as
                hitherto—have mean time bro't out "November Boughs," 140 pages, &amp; a big
                Vol. 900 pages, my "Complete Works," every thing poems &amp; prose—both Vols:
                at your service—Best wishes &amp; thanks—(I believe you have my Mrs:
                    Gilchrist book)—</p>
