                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Friend,</span>
            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">Your most kind letter of May 23<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rd</span> 
                duly received &amp; welcomed. Thank you from my heart.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It grieves me very much to note that at the time of writing there was no improvement
                in your condition—"the same continued." It is at once affecting &amp;
                inspiring that you should have written at all under such circumstances, &amp; that
                your letter should breathe such<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01208_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01208_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01208_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> unbroken cheer &amp; playful humour—as of robust &amp;
                undisturbed health—the "little spark of soul" shining serene &amp; unobscured
                in unwavering good cheer &amp; love—"master of all terror &amp; all pain"</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I at once made a careful facsimile copy &amp; sent it to Johnston.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I need not say that we shall be delighted to receive the "audacious" photo. you 
                promise us—which will have the additional
                interest of being the most recent portrait of you. I quite long to see it.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01209_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01209_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01209_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">It reminds me of an old intention of mine. I have several times wondered if the "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Portraits from Life</span>" advertised @ $3
                include portraits which I have not seen. And now I will enclose money order for 13s/-
                &amp; ask you to send me a set.—Provided, that is, that you are well enough
                &amp; that it will not trouble you too much.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The weather here is dull &amp; showery—with cool east winds. But we have just
                had a gorgeous sunset—rich &amp; warm.<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01210_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01210_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01210_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I hope that the weather is better
                with you &amp; more favourable to you—Here, there is quite an excessive amount
                of sickness—influenza mainly—&amp; the Drs (our friend Johnston amongst
                them) are very heavily worked.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very impatient of these slow mails. I long to know how you are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">now</span>, &amp; I am anxiously waiting for better news.—I
                cannot emulate your serene acceptance of whatever comes. Too much of warm personal
                love is wrapped up in you for that. And yet, my loved friend &amp; master, I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">know</span> in my heart of hearts that all is well, that "Love
                like the light silently wraps us all," &amp; that death
                itself cannot sever the love between us.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">God's blessing upon you, &amp; my tenderest love—</span>
