                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    J. McKee, wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.03270">April 7, 1888</a>: "I
                    received your letter but had been looking into the matter for some days
                    previously, Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke and Mr. Johnston having spoken to me about
                    your claim against Worthington. The difficulty I find is this that R.
                    Worthington failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own
                    name, and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of
                    which Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time
                    within which to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run
                    out and we are therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I
                    am therefore quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the
                    'Worthington Co.' has been doing with reference to your book. The Company is of
                    some responsibility and undoubtedly have possession of the plates. As soon as I
                    have facts sufficient to base a sure claim I will get the injunction and money.
