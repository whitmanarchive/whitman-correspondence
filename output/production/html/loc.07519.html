                probably with a bad cold the last three or four days—but beginning on the mend
                to day (I think)—Sent three little poems, one to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>, one to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's</span> &amp; one to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cosmopolitan</span> four

                will be resumed &amp; carried on (March has been paid for)—the weather here dark wet &amp; heavy—I am feeling fairly as I sit
