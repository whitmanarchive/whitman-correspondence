                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your good letter some days since, &amp; would like indeed to be down with you
                &amp; George &amp; all—but the bitter cold continues so I think I'd better
                stay close here for the present—but it won't be long before I shall be with
                you all—I suppose you &amp; the rest are reading Herbert's books from time to
                time—though they are very queer in the story of Blake's life and works, there
                is a deal that is interesting &amp; good to chew on—then they are such
                beautiful specimens of paper &amp; printing, it is a pleasure to read them</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a nice visit from Harry and Mont—there is nothing new or interesting to
                write you—it is now ½ past 2, after dinner, &amp; I have been writing
                &amp; fixing up a composition alone in my room, since breakfast—it is a
                cloudy, cold raw day here, rather lonesome, but still I make out—(but I could
                make out better if I have the rest of the day on a visit to Glendale, &amp; a good
                strong cup of tea with you &amp; Ruth, to cheer me up)—I am still feeling
                pretty well so far this winter, bless the Lord—I send Debbie a book "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the Old Curiosity Shop</span>"—love to her and Joe—have
                you had any more <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hog-killings</span>—which is the most fun?
                them or the Glendale church?</p>
