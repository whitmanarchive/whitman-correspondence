                    or May 14, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter early 1873. Edwin
                    Haviland Miller dated it about May 17, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:220, n. 85). Miller's date is more accurate than Bucke's, but a slightly
                    earlier date (May 13 or May 14) can be inferred from Walt Whitman's letter in
                    response and from Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman's report on Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's condition. Walt's mother had described "a trembling in my whole
                    system" in her <a href="duk.00615">May 5–6</a> letter, and he was
                    alarmed by his mother's letter (see his <a href="yal.00416">May 7,
                        1873</a> reply). Louisa's next brief letter, which instructed Walt "don't
                    send any more papers," was hardly reassuring (see her <a href="duk.00631">May 6 or 7, 1873</a> to Walt). Then her almost daily letters to Walt
                    stopped. Louisa was apparently unable to write Walt for several days, and this
                    letter is the next one he received. Walt acknowledged a letter, probably this
                    one, the following week as "your letter yesterday (Thursday)" (see his <a href="uva.00366">May 11, 1873</a>, <a href="nyp.00318">May 13,
                        1873</a>, and <a href="yal.00417">May 16, 1873</a> letters to
                    Louisa). Louisa Orr Whitman's report on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's condition,
                    that she "feel[s] better this morning," is in accord with Walt's description in
                    his May 16, 1873 letter. To be consistent both with the extended absence of
                    letters after Louisa's May 6 or 7, 1873 letter to Walt and with her reported
                    improvement in Louisa Orr's <a href="tex.00349">May 16, 1873</a> letter to
                    Walt, this letter is the one that Walt received on Thursday, May 15. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Walt Whitman). Based on the deterioration of her handwriting in that letter and
                    the absence of letters for several days, she may have suffered a second and more
                    incapacitating event. This letter is the first that she sent after the event,
                    though Walt had inquired anxiously for news for several days. On May 11 he wrote
                    that he would "feel anxious until I hear from you"; two days later he asked his
                    mother to "try to write a line soon after you get this" (see Walt's <a href="uva.00366">May 11, 1873</a> and <a href="nyp.00318">May 13,

                    from Sister Lou written Thursday morning, which gives me great relief, as it
                    says that Sunday was your worst day, &amp; that you have got relief now" (see

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
                    reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see

                    Walt prompted this fantasy by suggesting the same a few weeks earlier: "if you

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
                    care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
