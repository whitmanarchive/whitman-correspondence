                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For

                    Vermont. Charles Heyde often claimed to have been born in France, and he was
                    infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
                    Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in

                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office.

                    called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
                    mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death
                    in 1873. During his mother's final illness, George Whitman and his wife Louisa
                    Orr Haslam Whitman took over Eddy's care, with financial support from Walt
                    Whitman. In 1888, Eddy was moved to an asylum at Blackwood, New Jersey. For more
