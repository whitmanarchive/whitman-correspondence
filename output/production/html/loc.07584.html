            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Noon</span>—Feeling pretty well—dark &amp; rainy (the
                third day)—News not favorable from O'C[onnor] as you will
                see by enc'd card—I write a few lines every day to
                him &amp; send Mrs. O'C the Boston paper. The "process" plate
                (considerably reduced) of that ¾ pict: McK[ay] got in N Y.
                is good, &amp; I shall use it in book before long—Shall send it you (probably
                several impressions) soon as I have them printed nicely—definite bowel action
                this forenoon—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sat: Review</span> (March 2) has either gone
                to you, or will soon go (A rather curious notice)—I haven't seen Lawyer
                    Harned since you went—Horace was in this forenoon—faithful &amp;
                invaluable as ever—Mrs: Davis has come in for a few
                moments to see if I am "all right"—Ed has been making up
                the bed.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Toward sunset</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Had a good thorough bath this afternoon, hot water—my "cold" has not altogether
                withdrawn—I feel it in the head perceptibly enough an hour or two now and
                then—heavy sloppy muddy day—I almost envy your having such lots to do,
                responsibilities &amp; strong &amp; well &amp; energetic to do 'em—My <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">lassitude</span> is one of the worst points in my
                condition—but whether Sidney Morse's man's answer (when
                reproach'd for drunkenness) "Suppose 'twas so intended to be," was right or
                no—Mrs: Davis's woman's remark is "So it really <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">is</span> any
                how"—&amp; answers all philosophy &amp; argument (up to a certain line you
                probably say)—Well I will adjust myself for dinner, &amp; hope you &amp; Mrs
                    B &amp; all are having good times—&amp; send my love
                to all—</p>
