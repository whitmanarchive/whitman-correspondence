                as able to be out occasionally enjoying these June days. The world has not been so
                beautiful to me for a long time as this spring: probably because I have been at work
                like an honest man. I had, in my years of loafing, forgotten how sweet toil was. I
                suppose those generations of farmers back of me have had something to do with it.
                They all seem to have come to life again in me &amp; are happy since I have taken to
                the hoe &amp; the crow-bar. I had quite

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
