We are not to be universalists in painting &amp; sculpture are we (I guess not) &amp; revive the idiotic sculptures of India, Aegypt &amp; Palenque, or the old wood paintings of the Pre-Giottesque painters? Things grow obsolete—worn out. Yet Stedman welcomes heartily, he says, the idea of a new &amp; grander style in poetry. But I'm sure

                I don't know why I dwell on him: A lady had his volume here in the house yesterday, &amp; I re-read part of what he says on you. It seems to me not only insulting but terribly small &amp; boomerangish in its tendency, self-condemning, utterly inadequate, not touching the real heart of the matter at all—a dwarf walking round a giant, a pigmy measuring a god. </p>

                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
