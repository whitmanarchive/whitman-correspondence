                    Second U.S. Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He expected, he explained on <a href="loc.00598">September 28, 1863</a>, to rejoin his regiment shortly,
                    and was stationed near Washington when he wrote on <a href="loc.00889">October 13, 1863</a>. He wrote on <a href="loc.00601">December 16,
                        1863</a>, from Culpeper, Virginia, that he was doing provost duty, and on
                        <a href="loc.00602">February 28, 1864</a>, he was in a camp near
                    Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry hard." He was wounded again
                    on June 11 (so his parents reported to Whitman on <a href="loc.00603">August
                        29, 1864</a>), was transported to Washington, and went home on furlough on
                    July 1. He returned on August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30, 1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman: "I would like
                    to see you verry much, I have drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener
                    still." He expected to leave the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered
                    out, and on <a href="loc.00882">October 22, 1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman
                    from Queensbury, New York. When his parents communicated with Walt Whitman on
                        <a href="loc.00605">January 26, 1865</a>, Bethuel was well enough to
                    perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote
                    ten years later; see Whitman's letter to Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (Edwin
