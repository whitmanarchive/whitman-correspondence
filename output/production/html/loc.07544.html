            <p class="tei_p">Fair yesterday—a little dull &amp; tedious cribb'd up here so long, but got
                along—quite decided bowel action in the forenoon, &amp; a good thorough
                hot-water bath (tub) in the afternoon—my diet continues the same, mutton broth
                (plenty of rice in it,) dry toast, and a cup of milk (or two, during the day) with
                some ice cream (wh' tastes good &amp; welcome) ab't 1½ p m—I fancy I am
                growing very, very slowly to have more strength—but sit here pretty much the
                same—(I thoroughly believe in your diagnosis in letter of 24th)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This morning comes the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> of Jan: 3d with a
                splendid, nearly two-column criticism &amp; setting forth of the big book, from
                Sylvester Baxter—wh' I think even you will applaud &amp;
                be satisfied with—I will send the paper, but first wish to know if you have
                rec'd one from S B himself—(as I find I send sometimes what you have
                before)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">To-day opens dark &amp; wet &amp; lowering enough—no severe cold yet—I
                still have signs of my "cold in the head" (not violent) yet—a letter from
                    Kennedy—affectionate &amp; devoted—sit here in
                the big chair three quarters idling—no emphasized physical
                uncomfortableness—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1889-01-06"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Jan 6</span></span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">Lowering weather continued. A nice 20 minutes' call from Johnston &amp; Dick Hinton—also f'm Tom Harned—am ab't the same—comfortable enough—as
                I sit Ed is making up the bed—&amp; I am just going out
                to the wash-room—got in a cord of cut oak wood yesterday (ready therefore for
                a cold spell)—bowel action—Horace has just
                call'd—good luck to the meter—</p>
