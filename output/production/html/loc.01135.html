                    from Ruskin: "The reason neither he (yourself) nor Emerson are read in England
                    is first—that they are deadly true—in the sense of
                    rifles—against all our deadliest sins. The second that this truth is
                    asserted with an especial colour of American egotism which good English scholars
                    cannot, and bad ones will not endure. This is the particular poison and tare by
                    which the Devil has rendered their fruit ungatherable but by gleaning and loving
                    hands, or the blessed ones of the poor." The first sentence of this letter was

                    for "a sketch of your interior life—especially in relation to the
                    conception and elaboration of 'Leaves of Grass.'" On <a href="man.00003">February 3</a> he acknowledged receipt of articles about the poet by
                    O'Connor, Burroughs, and Gilchrist, and again requested more "inward and
                    outward" facts about the poet's life. On <a href="man.00004">February

                    arrangements for the sale of his works, a subject to which he again referred in

                    Bucke wrote: "I am myself fully satisfied that WALT WHITMAN is one of the
