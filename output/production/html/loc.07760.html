            <p class="tei_p">Sun shining brightly &amp; gayly as I write—The grip has seized me at
                last—bad case of aggravated <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cold in the head</span> &amp;c.
                &amp;c. with chest, throat, joints &amp;c: badly affected—bad enough, this is
                the fourth or fifth day, but if it passes off at these (wh' I think it will) will
                think myself lucky—As one thing I wish to speak the "Death of Abraham Lincoln"
                once more April 15—(probably the last time, ab't the 12th or 13th)—They
                are thinking of a sort of dinner in Phila May 31 in compliment of my beginning on my
                72d year, but we will see. Every thing is going on much the same—am sitting
                here as usual by the fire—weather mostly unpleasant and dark &amp;
                stormy—I get out at intervals in wheel chair—appetite &amp; sleep not
                even as well as before—but I hardly call them real bad yet—good bowel
                action day before yesterday—eye sight failing, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bad</span>

                15, prints an article (mark'd "in French") ab't me—I don't know whether it is the old article we know or a new one—the
                May <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> coming is to have a little poemet of mine—I
                will send you a couple of printed impressions on slips—Harry Stafford has
                given up his telegraphing &amp; RR job and moved to a nice (hired) farm with his
                wife &amp; two childer—he is poorly—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">mind-clouding</span> was temporary—(the worst of course is the eligibility
                of returning &amp; worse)—¼ to 2—I have had my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">massage</span>—y'rs of 30th comes &amp; is welcome—the April <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> comes—the pretty deep snow of yesterday
