                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                        not to be kicked out of all the celebration days of our New World, and

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    poems you ever wrote and so far from its being done off-hand it seems to me
