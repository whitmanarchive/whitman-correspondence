        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest friend,<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">1</a></span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">To your good &amp; comforting letter of Feb. 25th<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> I at once
        answer, at least with a few lines. I have already to–day written (answering one just rec'd from him) a pretty long letter to Mr Rossetti<a href="#n0522" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0522">3</a>, &amp; requested him to loan it to
        you for perusal. In that I have described my situation fully &amp; candidly.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My new edition is printed &amp; ready. On receipt of your letter I have mailed you a set,
        two vols., which you ought to have rec'd by this time. I wish you to send me word soon as they arrive.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My health I am encouraged to think is perhaps a shade better—certainly as well as any
        time of late. I even already vaguely contemplate plans, (they may never be fulfilled, but
        yet again they may,) of changes, journeys—even of coming to London, of seeing you, of
        visiting my friends, &amp;c. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My dearest friend, I do not approve your American trans–settlement<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a>—I see so many things here, you have yet no idea of—the
        American social &amp; almost every other kind of crudeness, meagreness, (at least in
        appearance)—Don't do any thing toward such a move, nor resolve on it, nor indeed make
        any move at all in it, without further advice from me. If I should get well enough to
        voyage, we will talk about it yet in London—You must not be uneasy about me—dear
        friend, I get along much better than you suppose. As to my literary situation here, my
        rejection by the coteries—&amp; my poverty, (which is the least of my
        troubles)—I am not sure but I enjoy them all. Besides, as to the latter, I am not in
        want. Best love to you, &amp; to your children. </p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Walt Whitman wanted her (and her passion) three thousand miles away. On <a href="loc.02886">January 18, 1876</a>, she informed him that she was
                    sailing for America on August 30, 1876. On <a href="loc.02887">February 25,
                        1876</a>, she was ecstatic: "Soon, very soon I come, my darling. . . .
                    this is the last spring we shall be assunder—O I passionately believe
                    there are years in store for us— . . . Hold out but a little longer for
                    me, my Walt." Gilchrist wrote again, on <a href="loc.02888">March 11,
                        1876</a>, after she had seen some of Whitman's poems in the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily News</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n0522">3. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0522 note" id="n0522"><span>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    exactly obey that, for it has been my settled steady purpose (resting on a deep
                    strong faith) ever since 1869." After reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two
                        Rivulets</span>, she could not curb her ardor, writing on <a href="loc.02890">April 21, 1876</a>: "sweetest deepest greatest
                    experience of my life—what I was made for, surely I was made as the soil
                    in which the precious seed of your thoughts &amp; emotions should be
                    planted—they to fulfil themselves in me, that I might by &amp; bye blossom
                    into beauty &amp; bring forth rich fruits—immortal fruits." Gilchrist sent
                    birthday greetings on <a href="loc.02891">May 18, 1876</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
