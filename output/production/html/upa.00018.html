        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">To your good &amp; comforting letter of Feb. 25th I at once
        answer, at least with a few lines. I have already to–day written (answering one just rec'd from him) a pretty long letter to Mr Rossetti, &amp; requested him to loan it to
        you for perusal. In that I have described my situation fully &amp; candidly.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My new edition is printed &amp; ready. On receipt of your letter I have mailed you a set,
        two vols., which you ought to have rec'd by this time. I wish you to send me word soon as they arrive.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">My health I am encouraged to think is perhaps a shade better—certainly as well as any
        time of late. I even already vaguely contemplate plans, (they may never be fulfilled, but
        yet again they may,) of changes, journeys—even of coming to London, of seeing you, of
        visiting my friends, &amp;c. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My dearest friend, I do not approve your American trans–settlement—I see so many things here, you have yet no idea of—the
        American social &amp; almost every other kind of crudeness, meagreness, (at least in
        appearance)—Don't do any thing toward such a move, nor resolve on it, nor indeed make
        any move at all in it, without further advice from me. If I should get well enough to
        voyage, we will talk about it yet in London—You must not be uneasy about me—dear
        friend, I get along much better than you suppose. As to my literary situation here, my
        rejection by the coteries—&amp; my poverty, (which is the least of my
        troubles)—I am not sure but I enjoy them all. Besides, as to the latter, I am not in
        want. Best love to you, &amp; to your children. </p>
