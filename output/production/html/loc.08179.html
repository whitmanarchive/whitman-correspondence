            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 24<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> to hand and welcomed. Seems to me, 
                dear old friend, that you hold your own pretty well tho' I realize that you are far from well and have 
                (mostly) a bad time. Have just received from England "Francis Bacon Poet, Prophet, Philosopher 
                VS. Phantom Capt. W<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">m</span> Shakespeare" by W.F.C. Wigston—Have
                not had a chance to look much into this book yet but it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">looks</span> interesting. In
                a preface he quotes a letter f'm Donnelly as follows: "I am still at work, in all
                leisure moments, upon the Cipher, and am working out the complete and perfect story, and hope to publish 
                something before long that will settle the controversity." I am quite full of this B.S. business and would 
                like to give a little time to it but that same time is a mighty scarce article with me at present. 
                We are all well here—Mrs B. has had a bad cold but is better again—I 
                guess Horace considers you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">well</span> as he has about quit 
                writing—I do not hear much from Wallace either—Weather here beginning
                to look and feel wintry—I like it.
