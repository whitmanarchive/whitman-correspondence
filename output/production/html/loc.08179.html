                dear old friend, that you hold your own pretty well tho' I realize that you are far from well and have 
                (mostly) a bad time. Have just received from England "Francis Bacon<a href="#n4261" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4261">2</a> Poet, Prophet, Philosopher 
                VS. Phantom Capt. W<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">m</span> Shakespeare" by W.F.C. Wigston<a href="#n2b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2b">3</a>—Have
                not had a chance to look much into this book yet but it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">looks</span> interesting. In
                a preface he quotes a letter f'm Donnelly<a href="#n4108" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4108">4</a> as follows: "I am still at work, in all
                leisure moments, upon the Cipher, and am working out the complete and perfect story, and hope to publish 
                something before long that will settle the controversity." I am quite full of this B.S. business and would 
                like to give a little time to it but that same time is a mighty scarce article with me at present. 
                We are all well here—Mrs B.<a href="#n4273" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4273">5</a> has had a bad cold but is better again—I 
                guess Horace<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">6</a> considers you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">well</span> as he has about quit 
                writing—I do not hear much from Wallace<a href="#n6121" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6121">7</a> either—Weather here beginning
                to look and feel wintry—I like it.

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
