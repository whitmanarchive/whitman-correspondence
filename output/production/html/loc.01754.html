            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 8th came this morning—You did perfectly right—I believe you are the greatest comfort I have &amp; if I get well, 
                our love &amp; attachment will be closer than ever. As I write it is about noon, 
                &amp; I am sitting up in my room, with a window open &amp; the bright sun streaming in. 
                I have confused spells of the head, &amp; have just had one, lasting about 20 minutes—they are not so bad &amp; prostrating as those of last week—I have to just sit still 
                &amp; wait till they pass over. I eat my breakfast with relish this morning, salmon, 
                Graham bread, coffee, &amp;c. But did not rest well last night. John Burroughs has been 
                to see me—staid a day &amp; night—he has settled up &amp; sold out in Washington, &amp; left—He is building a home on the Hudson river, 75 miles from N.Y.—has 10 acres 
                of land on west side of river. I am feeling quite bad to-day about a 13 year old boy[—]Rob Evans[—]I know here, next door but one—he has had his eye very badly hurt, 
                I fear it is put out, the doctor has given it up—by an arrow yesterday, the boys playing—I thought quite a good deal of him, he would do any thing for me—his father was French, 
                &amp; is dead—the boy suffers very much—&amp; the misfortune is a very, very sad one—</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01754.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01754.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01754.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is now ¼ after 12—&amp; every thing looks so sunny &amp; inviting out, I am going to try 
                to get out on the walk for a few minutes—but I don't navigate 
                as well as I did before I left <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington.​ ">Wn.</span>​

                <p class="tei_p">Another beautiful day—I enjoy it, but cannot go around in it—I went out yesterday[—]not far[—]but was badly overcome before I got back. At present my head cannot stand 
                any thing. Still, to-day I am feeling rather better than usual. I have eat my dinner—beef steak &amp; <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">potatos​ </span><span class="tei_corr">potatoes​
        
      </span></span>, with pumpkin pie &amp; a cup of tea—I eat very moderately, 
                but with quite a relish. Dear Pete, serious as these spells are, (&amp; seems as if 
                they <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">will</span> continue to come on,) I still have abiding hopes &amp; trust of my recovery yet—though I don't want to be too confident, &amp; wanted you to be prepared for whatever might happen. 
                I shall write a line to-day to Charles Eldridge—I am glad you have got some 
                acquainted with him—I know him thoroughly—he is a thoroughly good &amp; true man—has some ways &amp; notions of his own, but the main things are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">as solid</span> as the hills—Hinton too is a real good, kind man—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Now dear son dont worry about me—I think in all probability we shall yet be together—&amp; that I shall come round to be wholly or partially better—but whichever way it goes 
                with me, it will be all right—your latest two letters have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">been first rate</span>—I read the one before the last, many times,—it is very dear to me.
