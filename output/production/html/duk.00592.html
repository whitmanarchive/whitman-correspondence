                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman received a
                    letter from Walt Whitman "today the 13t" (not extant), and she had received a
                    letter from her daughter Mary Van Nostrand, to whom she had written about the
                    death of Jesse Whitman. The letter also refers to Thomas Jefferson Whitman's
                    departure from St. Louis as "last thursday a week ago tomorrow," which would
                    mean that Louisa wrote on a Wednesday. Louisa had anticipated a possible visit
                    by Jeff in her <a href="duk.00591">April 5, 1870</a> letter to Walt.
                    Because a letter from Mary Van Nostrand after her brother Jesse's death would be
                    expected, because Jeff's visit is consistent with her earlier letter, and
                    because April 13 fell on Wednesday, this letter dates to April 13, 1870. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00592_n11 note" id="duk.00592_n11"><span>Walt Whitman's April 11?,

                        at Kings County Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Jesse had suffered from
                        mental illness that included threats of violence for several years before he
