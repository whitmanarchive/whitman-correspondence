                    April 1, 1865, Whitman signed a contract with Eckler to stereotype 500 copies
                    for $254.00: "The workmanship is to be first class in every respect &amp; to
                    be completed, &amp; the printed sheets delivered within one month from this
                    date" (F. DeWolfe Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> [Gainesville,
                    FL: Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1959], xxxv). The contract called for
                    "one hundred &amp; twenty pages," but since the book contained only 72 pages,
                    Eckler submitted on <a href="loc.00853">April 22</a> a bill for
                    $192.85, of which $138.00 had been paid. According to Whitman's
                    notations on the statement, he paid $20.00 on April 26 and again on May 2,
                    perhaps with this letter. Whitman sent another letter on <a href="loc.00841">May 3</a> in answer to Eckler's request of May 1 that the balance be
                    paid. On <a href="loc.00855">May 4</a>, Eckler issued a receipt for
                    $34.85, and included a receipt from Coridon A. Alvord, printer, for the
                    stereotype plates, which he had placed in his vault. On <a href="loc.00880">April 26</a>, Eckler had informed Whitman that the book was "now to
                    press" and would "be ready for the Binders next Monday morning." For details on
