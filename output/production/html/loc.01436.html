                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I posted to you the other day a copy of the London "Inquirer", containing a notice of
                your "Specimen Days &amp; Collect," which I wrote some little time ago. Since then I have been very glad to learn that the book
                is already republished in England, &amp; that a new edition of "Leaves of Grass" is
                to follow.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hope you will not consider it an impertinence in quite a young man to write as I
                have done, but I have found so much refreshment &amp; real delight in your books,
                that I was anxious to do what I could to extend the good gift to others.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If you have time &amp; patience to read my review I should be extremely obliged if
                you would tell me whether <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01436.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01436.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01436.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>there are any mistakes in the statement of facts as to your life.
                It is so easy to be led into inaccuracies, which ought to be corrected.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have the "Leaves of Grass" constantly by me, &amp; in the intervals of other work
                am trying to make a study of the book. It seems to me distinctly one of the
                prophetic messages of our day—a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">real</span> voice of our
                best manhood, absolutely free from anything conventional, such as we need to make us
                feel the true grandeur &amp; infinite capabilities of our life, &amp; the divine
                beauty of the universe.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am not sure that I altogether understand your message yet, especially with regard
                to the present evil in the world. It seems to me that in the degradation of women,
                &amp; the brutal selfishness of so many men, we have a form <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01436.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01436.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01436.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> of evil that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ought not</span> to be suffered with patience, or hidden under the soothing light
                of Hegelian Pantheism. On the contrary I feel that it is a
                part of our life where the exercise of human freedom must come in, &amp; feeling
                that this is evil for which we are personally responsible, determine to be rid of it
                as far as we are concerned, &amp; to do what we can to uphold the right principle of
                life, honour for women, continence for men, &amp; the home the centre of all good &amp; sacred
                influence. This I think is essential to the growth of a strong &amp; healthy life,
                morally as well as physically, &amp; to the full enjoyment of all that is good &amp;
                beautiful in the world.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall not be surprised if you have just the same feeling—but, as I say, I do
                not think I have quite understood the whole of your message yet, &amp; sometimes it
                has seemed to me as though <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01436.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01436.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01436.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> you were too well satisfied with the present condition of our
                life, in such a way as to leave the poisonous canker of vice slowly eating its way
                through society, content to enjoy the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">picturesque</span> side of
                even the lowest form of life, instead of rousing men in the strength of their moral
                capacity really to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">be</span> men, &amp; to set right whatever is
                wrong through their fault.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am afraid you may be much troubled by unknown correspondents, but you have spoken
                to me so much as a friend through your poems, that I feel almost inclined to claim
                the right of friendship in saying what I have—&amp; I trust that I shall not
                have caused you any annoyance.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If you can give me any help with regard to the above question, I shall esteem it a
                great kindness; &amp; in any case I assure you of my lasting gratitude for all we
                have received at your hands.</p>
