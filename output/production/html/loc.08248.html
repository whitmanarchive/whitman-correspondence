            <p class="tei_p">Sitting here alone in my den—rather a bad day—this grip on me
                heavily—sweating a little the last hour &amp; rather better—y'r good
                letter of 26th came at sundown mail &amp; has somehow
                cheer'd me—had my supper &amp; relish'd it—oysters,—havn't rec'd
                "Old Poets" yet but I believe it is in 
                the Nov. N A <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Review</span>—you will see how (intentionally) gossipy it is—I wonder
                whether I had better adhere to that way &amp; style wh' is very easy to my fingers
                &amp; rather pleasant as work to my mind—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Have been putting the last hour in a leisurely <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">body
                bath</span>—&amp; shall have a good massage in a short hour f'm now, as I get to
                bed—Give my love to dear boy Pardee, &amp; tell him I
                remember him well, &amp; hope to see him yet—the
                Boston <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Trans</span> gives an item to the Lafayette evening lunch
                &amp; copies the "Midnight Visitor" wonderfully
                correctly as recited by me—the Ing: affair seems to be
                largely newspaperially commented on pro &amp; con, &amp; reported
                everywhere—shoals of vermin enemies of W W are roused too with their strange
                shocking slanders ("at wh' innocence itself is confounded" as O'C 
                used to say)</p>  

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1890-10-29">29th Oct: am</span>—dark wet forenoon—good bowel
                action—Wm Ingram here this mn'g—nothing
                new—ab't as usual with me—my love to you Horace—Tom is in the midst of the (local) political
                whirl—I finish as I sit here alone by the stove</p>
