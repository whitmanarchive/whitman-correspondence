                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Jessie. He would receive his M.D. from the Univeristy of Western Ontario in 1897

                    poem called "The Midnight Visitor" by French writer Henri Murger
                    (1822–1861). Whitman was known to have recited the poem to great effect.
                    Thomas B. Harned notes in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoirs</span> that, while Whitman
                    "never recited his own poems at the table," he did have a "fine clear voice and
                    was a good elocutionist. He had a version of 'The Midnight Visitor' by Berger
                        [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>]" (Hartford: Transcendental Books, 1972, p. 34).
                    Traubel confirms this as well, writing that Whitman recited the poem "with
                    gusto" and "was much applauded" for his performance (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt

                    Whitman was often cited as author, and in some cases as translator (for more,

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    where the two discussed religion and death, and where Whitman recited Murger's
                    "The Midnight Visitor." The event was widely covered in newspapers; see, for

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
