            <p class="tei_p">Monday night, tuesday night and wednesday night on account of traveling and one
                botheration or another I had short allowance of sleep so last night I went to bed
                early and slept 9 1/2 hours without waking or I believe moving and today I feel
                better. [—] We are having quite spring like weather here, warm &amp; bright.
                This evening it looks a little like rain, by all appearance we shall have an early
                spring—our grounds are already full of robins—in the early morning they
                sing as if it was the middle of april.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you today a piece I wrote for an uncle more than thirty years ago about my old
                wanderings in the States 53–58 [/]<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I do not know whether
                you ever saw it [/] if not it may amuse you for a few minutes. I promised Horace<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">3</a> to send him a copy of my Saguenay poem<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> but please tell him I cannot find one and fear they are
                all gone.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am hard at work getting into the run of things after by absence [/] in another day
                or two it will be just as if I had been here all the time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well, the health of the institution is first class. My Annual Report is
                out—I have written for some copies and shall send you one as soon as I get

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
                    see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
