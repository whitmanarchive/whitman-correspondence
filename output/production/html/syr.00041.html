            <p class="tei_p">Monday night, tuesday night and wednesday night on account of traveling and one
                botheration or another I had short allowance of sleep so last night I went to bed
                early and slept 9 1/2 hours without waking or I believe moving and today I feel
                better. [—] We are having quite spring like weather here, warm &amp; bright.
                This evening it looks a little like rain, by all appearance we shall have an early
                spring—our grounds are already full of robins—in the early morning they
                sing as if it was the middle of april.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you today a piece I wrote for an uncle more than thirty years ago about my old
                wanderings in the States 53–58 [/] I do not know whether
                you ever saw it [/] if not it may amuse you for a few minutes. I promised Horace to send him a copy of my Saguenay poem but please tell him I cannot find one and fear they are
                all gone.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am hard at work getting into the run of things after by absence [/] in another day
                or two it will be just as if I had been here all the time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well, the health of the institution is first class. My Annual Report is
                out—I have written for some copies and shall send you one as soon as I get
                them</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am reading nothing, far too busy, feeling first rate</p>
