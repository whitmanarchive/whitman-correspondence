                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor
                    for his services in the Civil War. In his 1900 autobiography <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eccentricities of Genius</span> (G. W. Dillingham Co: New York), he writes of
                    Whitman: "Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his life. They
                    were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the theatres of New
                    York City"; Pond concludes with an anecdote about the poet's meeting with Sir
                    Edwin Arnold (497–501). </span></span> [<a href="#r3112">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00797_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00797_n1"><span>This is a reference to
                    Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
                    this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
                    over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
                    published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days and Collect</span> (1882–83). For more on

                    apparently a great success. James B. Pond recounts it as follows: "It was indeed

                    on Lincoln's birthday. Just as he was about to recite 'My Captain,' a little
                    girl, the granddaughter of Edmund Clarence Stedman, walked out upon the stage
                    and presented him with a beautiful bouquet of roses" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eccentricities of Genius</span>, G. W. Dillingham Co: New York, 1900,
