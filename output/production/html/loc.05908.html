            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">A kind of anxiety has for some time past weighed upon me and upon others, I find, who
                love &amp; admire you, that you do not have all the comforts you ought to have; that
                you are perhaps sometimes straightened for means. We have had letters from several
                young men, almost or quite strangers to us, asking questions on this subject; and we
                hoped &amp; thought that if this were so, you would permit those who have received
                such priceless gifts from you to put their gratitude into some tangible shape, some
                "free-will offering." Hence the paragraph was put into the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span> which I send with this,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> and we were
                proceeding to organize our forces when your paper came to hand this morning (the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden Post</span>, July 3), which seems decisively to bid us
                desist. Or at all events wait till we had told you of our wishes and plan. One thing
                would, I feel sure, give you pleasure in any case; and that is to know that there is
                over here a little band—perhaps indeed it is now quite a considerable one, for
                we had not yet had time to ascertain how considerable—who would joyfully
                respond to that Poem of yours, "To Rich Givers." </p>
            <p class="tei_p">A friend and near neighbour of ours, Frederick Wedmore,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> is coming over to America
                this autumn, and counts much on coming to see you. He is a well-known writer on Art
                here—a friendly, candid, open-minded man with whom, I think, you will enjoy a
                    talk.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am on the lookout for Miss Smith<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a>—shall indeed
                enjoy a talk with a special friend of yours, dear Walt. I hope she will not fail to
                come. Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">4</a> is away at Haslemere. Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">5</a>
                just going to write for himself to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">That is a very graphic bit in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Post</span>—the portrait of
                Hugo, the canary &amp; the kitten<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">6</a>—I like to know
                all that—as well as to hear the talk.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    being formed in England with a view to presenting a free-will offering to the
                    American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is in his sixty-seventh year, and has since
                    his enforced retirement some years ago from official work in Washington, owing
                    to an attack of paralysis, maintained himself precariously by the sale of his
                    works in poetry and prose, and by occasional contributions to magazines." The
                    magazine lists Anne Gilchrist's son Herbert as well as William Rossetti as the
                    parties responsible for the collection. In mid-August of that year, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Athenaeum</span> printed Whitman's letter to Herbert Gilchrist
                    of <a href="upa.00078">August 1, 1885</a>, in which Whitman said he
                    "should decidedly and gratefully accept anything" sent as an offering. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02188_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02188_n1"><span>Frederick Wedmore
