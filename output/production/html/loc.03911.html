            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of over a week ago <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —&amp; I should have <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="answered​ ">answer'd</span>​  before, but I expected to come down myself, or send word—but one
                thing or another delays the publication of my new book, &amp; I am waiting for
                that—it is all printed and ready, &amp; will be out early this coming
                week—I will bring you one when I come down—there is lots in about the
                pond &amp; the old lane &amp;c. and my times there five or six years ago—(but
                there are ever so many subjects in it)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I went round yesterday in the rain to make a short visit to Mrs Rogers<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—She is pretty well,
                considering—complains of being weak in the limbs &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="flushed​ ">flush'd</span>​  with the heat, but sat in the parlor &amp; talked very cheerful &amp;
                friendly, some time—said she hoped you would come up very soon—I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="asked​ ">ask'd</span>​  if she didnt intend going down to your house soon—she said no, she expected to go
                on east (<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Massachusetts​ ">Mass:</span>​ ) to see her daughter—she said Amos was to be home that Saturday
                evening, to stay over Sunday—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="asked​ ">ask'd</span>​  me to come around &amp; get acquainted with him—So I had a very
                pleasant little visit—Every thing there <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="looked​ ">look'd</span>​  about the same, nice &amp; comfortable—Jane came to the
                door—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We have had nothing but rain, rain, here, the last three or four days—seems to
                pour down all day long—it is well I didn't come down early in the week as I
                had intended <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00518_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_jc.00518_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_jc.00518_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_jc.00518_large.jpg</span> but now
                as I write (Sunday, late forenoon) it is very pleasant sunshiny again—as I sit
                here the bells are ringing for church, off aways—sounds very good—every thing quite delightful after the long
                dark equinoctial storm—but I just wish I was down <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">there</span> this minute—a day there in the woods—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Where my books are now <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="published​ ">publish'd</span>​  is 23 South 9th Street, Philadelphia<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> (not far
                from Leary's book store)—and they have fixed me up a big table and arm chair,
                by a window up stairs, all to myself—&amp; there I go for an hour or two or
                three, every day if I like—the whole building is <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="stuffed​ ">stuff'd</span>​  with books, some old, some very costly, some very rare—all the
                histories, dictionaries &amp;c. you can think of, &amp; everything else—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—Nothing very new with me—I still keep well—eat my rations every
                time—I havn't seen or heard any thing of Harry or any of you for a long
                time—except I saw Joe<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> at the ferry over a week
                ago—I want to come down Friday next, to Kirkwood, in the usual 4 o'clock
                train—shall be down Friday<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—Love to you and
                George, Ruthy &amp; all—</p>
