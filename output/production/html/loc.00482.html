            <p class="tei_p">I was very very glad to get a letter from you yesterday. I have been quite worried about you, wondering how things were going  I am more than glad to hear that you are holding your own</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am up here on a question of the disposal of the sewage of the city  Davis and Flad are associated with me and we have been confabing about a week—Yesterday they went away—leaving me here to make surveys etc</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am going down to Chicago in the morning to meet some people—will be back here on Wednesday</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope dear Walt that you are gaining again—I was very sorry that I could not get back to Camden—but I had to go with my Committee to Louisville</p>
