                        1863</a>. Henry Flad (1824-98) graduated from the University of Munich in
                    1846. Sentenced to death after serving as captain of engineers in the
                    Parliamentary Army during the revolution of 1848, he fled to New York City in
                    1849 and embarked on a distinguished career in civil engineering. He worked on
                    several railroad projects, including one which brought him to Missouri in 1854.
                    He joined the Union army in 1861 and eventually became colonel of the First
                    Regiment of Engineers, Missouri Volunteers. In 1865 he became the chief
                    assistant engineer under James P. Kirkwood on the St. Louis Water Works and
                    served continuously on the Board of Water Commissioners from 1867 to 1875.
                    During this period he was also the assistant engineer on the Eads Bridge, a
                    pioneering achievement in bridge construction. He was a cofounder of the
                    Engineers' Club of St. Louis and served as its president from 1868 to 1880. He
                    was president of the St. Louis Board of Public Improvements from 1877 to 1890
                    and was elected president of the American Society of Civil Engineers in
                    1886. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
