                        (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                        and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
                        adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
                        he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
                        through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
                        St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For

                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken

                    1867. Mason's daughter Irene was a close friend of Mattie (see Louisa Van Velsor

                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
