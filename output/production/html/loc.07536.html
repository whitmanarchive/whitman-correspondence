            <p class="tei_p">A change in the weather—cloudy &amp; disposed to rain—very moderate
                temperature—I continue to feel fairly &amp; what may be call'd
                improving—bowel movement this forenoon—I read letter from my young
                valued journalistic (German-educated &amp; theosophistic) friend in Boston,
                Sylvester Baxter, wh' I include—also copy <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">printed</span> of your letter on big book—(I can send several copies if you want)—have
                rec'd yours of 24th, &amp; note carefully what you say of food, alcohol, &amp;c, and
                of the effete wretchedness—all thoroughly judged &amp; true, &amp; shall
                charge myself practically with it—certainly so—&amp; glad to get it
                all—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As I write, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Post</span> paper comes, with an item ab't my health
                &amp;c, authentic—&amp; I enclose two more printed
                copies of the letter &amp; send—I have rec'd from F B Sanborn &amp; Kennedy,
                acknowledging the big books. Rec'd y'rs of evn'g Dec. 25th—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">3 P M</span>—Passing an easier day upon the whole—have
                just eaten chocolate ice cream—read y'rs of 24th a second time—I guess I am getting along pretty well,
                considering everything—to have <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the books</span> off my mind is
                a great relief—If I can now be freed of this gastric, head &amp; feeble
                trouble—</p>
