                you realized the joy it is to me to receive a few words from you—about anything that

                be tedious; but it is not so now—for always close at hand lie the books that are so 
                dear so dear I brooding over the poems sunning myself in them, pondering the Vistas—all 
                the experience of my past life &amp; all its aspirations corroborating them—all my

                by &amp; through these—outwardly &amp; inwardly. How then can I be content to live

                am sure it is not possible for any one,—man or woman, it does not matter which, to

                beauty: but with an understanding responsive heart, without feeling it drawn out of their 
                breasts so that they must leave all &amp; come to be with you sometimes—without a 
                resistless yearning for personal intercourse that will take no denial. When we come to America, 
                I shall not want you to talk to me; shall not be any way importunate. To settle down where

                take food with us; if my music pleased you, to let me play &amp; sing to you of an evening; do 
                your needlework for you—talk freely of all that occupied my thoughts concerning the

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                        Whitman</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1906), 203–205. A dispatch to the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> on June 29, 1872, reported that Whitman "was cordially met
                    by the venerable gentlemen sitting upon the platform. He then took his position
                    at the desk and read, with clearness of enunciation, his poem, written for the
                    occasion, 'As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free.' As Whitman himself said to the
                    writer, 'There is no one expression that could stand as the subject of the
                    poem.'" "As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free" was later printed as part of the volume

                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
