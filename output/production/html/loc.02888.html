                News" sublime Poems (one of them reaching dizzy heights) filling my soul with strong
                delight. These prefaced by a few words timid enough yet kindly in tone, &amp; better

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Walt Whitman," one of the first significant pieces of criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, moved with three of her children
                    (Herbert, Beatrice, and Grace) from England to Philadelphia. The family lived in
                    Philadelphia from 1876 to 1878; Whitman visited their home almost daily and even
                    had his own room. From April 1878, to 1879, the Gilchrists lived in Concord,
                    Boston, and New York, before returning to England. Anne's son Herbert
                    (1857–1914) remained in America and lived in Philadelphia, maintaining a
                    close relationship with Whitman; after Whitman's death in 1892, he returned to
                    England. For more on Whitman and the Gilchrists, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
