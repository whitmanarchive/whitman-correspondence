                <span class="tei_salute">MY DEAREST FRIEND:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Herby went to David Bognes about a week ago: he himself was out, but H. saw
                the head man, who reported that the sale of "Leaves of Grass" was progressing
                satisfactorily. I hope you have received, or will receive, tangible proof of the
                same. Bognes is a young publisher, but, I believe from what I hear, a man to be
                relied on. His father was the publisher of my husband's first literary venture &amp;
                behaved honourably. Herby brought away for me a copy of the new edition. I like the
                type like that of '73, &amp; the pale green leaf it is folded in so to speak. I find
                a few new friends to love—perhaps I have not yet found them all out. But you
                must not expect me to take kindly to any changes in the titles or arrangement of the
                old beloved friends. I love them too dearly—every word &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">look</span> of them—for that. For instance, I want "Walt Whitman" instead
                of "Myself" at the top of the page. Also my own longing is always for a
                chronological arrangement, if change at all there is to be; for that at once makes
                biography of the best kind. What deaths, dear Friend! As for me, my heart is
                already gone over to the other side of the river, so that sometimes I feel a kind of
                rejoicing in the swelling of the ranks of the great company there. Darwin, with his
                splendid day's work here gently closed; Rossetti, whose brilliant genius had got
                entangled in a premature physical decay, so that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">his</span> day's
                work was over too! In a letter to me, William, who was the best, most faithful
                &amp; loving of brothers to him, says, "I doubt whether he would ever have regained
                that energy of body &amp; concentration of mental resource which could have enabled
                him to resume work at his full &amp; wonted power. Without these faculties at ready
                command my dear Gabriel would not have been himself." Edward Carpenter's father,
                too, is gone, but he at a ripe age without disease—sank gently.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The photographs I enclose are but poor suggestions—please give one to Mrs.
                Whitman with my love, or if you prefer to keep both, I will send her others. Does
                the idea ever come into your head, dear Friend, of spending a little time this
                summer or autumn in your English home at Hampstead?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Herby is well and working happily. So is Grace. Little grandson &amp; his parents
                away in Worcestershire.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is indescribably lovely spring weather here just now. A carpenter near us has a
                sky-lark in a cage which sings as jubilantly as if it were mounting into the
                sky, &amp; is so tame that when he takes it out of the cage to wash its little
                claws, which are apt to get choked up with earth, in warm water, it breaks out
                singing in his hand!</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love from us all, dearest Friend. Good-bye.</span>
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">ANNE GILCHRIST.</span>
            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">Affectionate greetings to your brother &amp; sister &amp; Hattie &amp;
                    Jessie.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Do you ever see Mr. Marvin? If so, give our love, we hope to see him one day.</p>
