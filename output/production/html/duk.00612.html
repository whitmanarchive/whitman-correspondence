                        January 19, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1873.
                        But Edwin Haviland Miller dated it to 1869, and Sherry Ceniza dated it to
                        1872 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New
                        York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman
                            and 19th-Century Women Reformers</span> [Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama
                        Press, 1998], 242, n. 1). Miller is correct: the letter dates to 1869. The
                        source of Bucke's error is unknown, and Ceniza was misled by Louisa Van
                        Velsor Whitman's plan to send a package to daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde,
                        which seems to echo her <a href="duk.00611">January 12, 1869</a>
                        letter to Walt Whitman that Ceniza dated incorrectly to 1871 (242, n.
                        1).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The year 1869 can be confirmed by the publication of one of Walt Whitman's
                        poems and a visit to Brooklyn by Joseph Phineas Davis, which closely matches
                        a letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. Louisa received a copy of the
                        February 1869 issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span>, which
                        printed Walt Whitman's "Proud Music of the Sea-Storm." Louisa did not note
                        the title of the poem, but she did inform Walt that he need not forward a
                        copy. Walt acknowledged receiving copies of the February issue of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> on almost the same day (see his <a href="uva.00353">January 20, 1869</a> letter to James T. Field).
                        Joseph Phineas Davis visited Louisa the previous Sunday, and the possibility
                        that Davis would visit Walt in Washington on his return to St. Louis is
                        corroborated by Jeff Whitman's <a href="loc.00452">January 21,
                            1869</a> letter to Walt. Davis in March 1870 was working in Lowell,
                        Massachusetts (see Louisa's <a href="hyb.00002">March 16, 1870</a> to
                        Walt), and in 1871 Davis was working in Boston, so his plan to return to St.
                        Louis corroborates the year 1869. Finally, the letter refers to January 19
                        as "to day tuesday," and January 19 fell on Tuesday in the year
                    1869.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
                    reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
                    care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
                    financial support from Walt Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r13">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">10. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00479_n9 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00479_n9"><span>Joseph Phineas Davis
                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
                    later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
                    (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.

                    Jessie Louisa. Based on the report that Mattie "seems to be gaining" in this
                    letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had probably received the January 7, 1869
                    letter, in which Mattie wrote, "I cough very little and raise scarcly any

                    moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the
                    position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that
