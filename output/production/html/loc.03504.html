                    (1838–1904) was a journalist and editor from Dublin, Ireland. After
                    graduating from Trinity College, he served an apprenticeship in London and
                    worked as a correspondent for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Chronicle</span> during
                    the Franco-German War.

                    Robinson was apparently highly regarded among writers like Julian Hawthorne and
                    James Whitcomb Riley, and he authored a number of books himself, including a
                    farce and works on history.
