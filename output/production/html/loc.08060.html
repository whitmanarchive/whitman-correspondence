                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1864–1954) married Horace Traubel in Whitman's Mickle Street house in
                    Camden, New Jersey, in May 1891. After Whitman's birthday celebration on May 31,
                    1891, the couple traveled with the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke back
                    to London, Ontario, where they stayed until returning to Camden, New Jersey, on
                    June 14. The couple had one daughter, Gertrude (1892–1983), and one son,
                    Wallace (1893–1898). Anne was unimpressed with Whitman's work when she
                    first read it, but later became enraptured by what she called its "pulsating,
                    illumined life," and she joined Horace as associate editor of his
                    Whitman-inspired periodical <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Conservator</span>. Anne edited
                    a small collection of Whitman's writings, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Little Book of
                        Nature Thoughts</span> (Portland, Maine: Thomas B. Mosher, 1896). After
                    Horace's death, both Anne and Gertrude edited his manuscripts of his
                    conversations with Whitman during the final four years of the poet's life, which
                    eventually became the nine-volume <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
