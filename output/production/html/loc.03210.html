Although I entirely disagree with you in all points connected with artistic form, and in so much of the outcome of your doctrine as is involved in those poetic exposures of the person which your pages so unreservedly make, yet I feel

It is not known to me where I can find another modern song at once so large and so naïve: and the time needs to be told few things so much as the absolute personality of the person, the sufficiency of the man's manhood <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">to</span> the man, which you have propounded in such strong and beautiful rhythms.

                    sent his "Picture of St. John" to Whitman on <a href="loc.00871">November
                        12, 1866</a>. He commended Whitman's "remarkable powers of expression" and
                    "deep and tender reverence for Man." His letter of <a href="loc.00872">December 2, 1866</a>, was even more unreserved in its praise. Later,
                    Taylor's response to Whitman would change dramatically. Taylor used his
                    influence on the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> to turn it from a
                    supporter of Whitman and his work to a hostile critic. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Echo Club</span> (2d ed., 1876 154–158, 168–169), Taylor
                    burlesqued Whitman's poetry. William Sloane Kennedy lists him among Whitman's
                    "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Villifiers"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight of
