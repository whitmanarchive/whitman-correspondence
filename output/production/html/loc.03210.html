            <p class="tei_p">A short time ago while on a visit to New York I happened one evening to find your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves Of Grass</span> in Mr. Bayard Taylor's library: and taking it with me to my room at the hotel I spent a night of glory and delight upon it  How it happened that I had never read this book before . . is a story not worth the telling; but, in sending the enclosed bill to purchase a copy (which please

            mail to the above address) I cannot resist the temptation to render you also my grateful thanks for such large and substantial thoughts uttered in a time when there are, as you say in another connection, so many "little plentiful mannikins skipping about in collars and tailed coats." Although I entirely disagree with you in all points connected with artistic form, and in so much of the outcome of your doctrine as is involved in those poetic exposures of the person which your pages so unreservedly make, yet I feel

It is not known to me where I can find another modern song at once so large and so naïve: and the time needs to be told few things so much as the absolute personality of the person, the sufficiency of the man's manhood <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">to</span> the man, which you have propounded in such strong and beautiful rhythms.
