                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
                    this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
                    over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
                    published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days and Collect</span> (1882–83). For more on

                    the Academy of Natural Sciences, where he taught archaelogy and ethnology, and,
                    later, he worked as a professor of linguistics and archaeology at the University
                    of Pennsylvania. Whitman admired Brinton, who would speak at the poet's

The
                    volume was published by the poet himself in an arrangement with publisher David
                    McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves

                    1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding
                    decisions, and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo
                    of the poet on the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom,

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who

                    introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
                    the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
