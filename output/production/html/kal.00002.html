                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    influence of Bayard Taylor, began to publish hostile notices. Burroughs' defense
                    was published on April 13, 1876. On April 22, 1876, William D. O'Connor,
                    Whitman's estranged friend, wrote an extravagant, and garrulous, encomium. Later
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> resumed its friendly attitude toward
                    Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r1063">back</a>]</li></ul>
