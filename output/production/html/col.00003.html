            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have just received your letter of the 7th inst. I appreciate your kindness in the
                matter of the poem. I
                send herewith a verbatim copy of Emerson's note, as
                requested.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new or special with me, these days. I am well as usual—am still
                employed in the Attorney General's Office. A new edition of my book will be printed
                this fall, with another small volume in prose. You shall have
                early copies, may-be in sheets.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Farewell for the present. I send you my love—Write whenever you can.</p>
