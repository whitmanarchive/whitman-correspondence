               Your letter of 3<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> inst. came last evening and was heartily welcomed. [—]
                Many thanks also for the Press of 3<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> containing  "A Poets Greeting to a Poet."
                /fishy-fish enough / [—] I wish I could have been there and assisted in the good talk. [—]
                So Wallace has gone—I guess he will live a long time before he forgets his
                visit to America—I am rejoiced that he came so that we could have the chance of showing him a little attention in return to the
                the many kindnesses he has done us. He is a splendid fellow and I trust I may often see him and the other good Bolton fellows before
                I finish my earthly pilgrimage—such chaps as they are make the world worth living in. All quiet here and nothing new. I have a 2
                hour lecture tomorrow morning and have just been hard at work preparing it. I wish you had some of my physical strength, dear Walt, so that
                Major Pond might take <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> on the lecture platform—but I fear
                that cannot be—worse luck!
