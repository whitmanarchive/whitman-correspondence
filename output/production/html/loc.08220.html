                visit to America—I am rejoiced that he came so that we could have the chance of showing him a little attention in return to the
                the many kindnesses he has done us. He is a splendid fellow and I trust I may often see him and the other good Bolton fellows before
                I finish my earthly pilgrimage—such chaps as they are make the world worth living in. All quiet here and nothing new. I have a 2
                hour lecture tomorrow morning and have just been hard at work preparing it. I wish you had some of my physical strength, dear Walt, so that
                Major Pond<a href="#n3112" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3112">7</a> might take <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> on the lecture platform<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">8</a>—but I fear

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
