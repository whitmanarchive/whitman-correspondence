            <p class="tei_p">I return herewith the printed slips with Dr. Knortz's
                    translations. That of the 'Out of the Cradle
                endlessly Rocking' is of really splendid power, &amp; would be perfect but for
                some curious failures to understand the English—e.g. 'that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">low</span> and delicious word'—low is translated
                'gemein' (= vulgar) instead of 'leise' (low in sound, tone). 'Absorbing' is rendered
                'absorbed in thought'—the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">word</span> stronger and
                sweeter than any' he has read as 'world'! &amp;c. I have translated the said poem, and was just
                writing the last two or three lines, when the cannons boomed and bells rang
                announcing the New Year last night. I got your postcard, &amp; sent copies to Dr.
                K. and Schmidt. The latter has kindly sent me something of his in return, which
                unfortunately I can't read, not knowing Danish. But it
                has such a tantalising resemblance to German that I mean to learn it—enough
                for reading purposes. Many thanks for the copy of the Critic, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">recd</span>​  yesterday. Matt. Arnold himself said that he feared he should see
                little or nothing of the real America, &amp; he is right. The misery of the poorer classes in England is fast

                catastrophe &amp; overturn impending. Fortunately such a thing is not likely to
                prove fruitless, if it does happen, for people know now pretty well what they
                want—that is—State guarantee that as long as there is food in a
                community, no person willing to work, shall want. That is to say, society to be
                organized on the human, not on the wild-beast principle. "The Age of Feudalism" says
                Carlyle "perished—having produced the still more indomitable Age of Hunger."
                And the Age of Hunger will prove more indomitable than that of 'Competition' too. I
                wonder do you know a man called Carpenter (Edward), lives in
                England, has written a book called '<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Towards Democracy</span>' of which he will surely have
                sent you a copy? He is doing much good work
                there—issues pamphlets, lectures, &amp;c. against the Tyranny of
                capitalism—Is it not certain that you in America will have all this to go
                through some day when you get more densely populated &amp; the squeeze begins? And
                wouldn't it be well to put things on a right footing <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">now</span>,
                instead of waiting till vested interests, &amp;c. accumulate &amp; force justice
                &amp; charity to appear in the guise of avenging angels?</p>
