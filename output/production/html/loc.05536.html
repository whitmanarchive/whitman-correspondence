                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    Apparently Whitman forwarded Knortz's translations to Rolleston, who is now, on
                    January 1, 1884, returning them with comments. Karl Knortz (1841–1915),
                    the German-American scholar and admirer of Whitman, became Rolleston's

                    confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
                    uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
                    the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
                    without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Matthew

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
                    Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:
                        An Encyclopedia</span>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

                    the book went through several editions during Carpenter's lifetime
                    (1844–1929). In an introductory note to the 1912 edition, he states that
                    he first came across William Michael Rossetti's selections from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> while still at Cambridge, in 1868 or
                    1869, and that he read Rossetti's volume and the complete American editions
                    continuously for ten years. He acknowledges Whitman's influence in the following
                    statements: "I find it difficult to imagine what my life would have been without
                    it. 'Leaves of Grass' 'filtered and filtered' my blood; but I do not think I
                    ever tried to imitate it or its style.... I did not adopt it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">because</span> it was an approximation to the form of 'Leaves of Grass.'
                    Whatever resemblance there may be between the rhythm, style, thoughts,
                    construction, etc., of the two books, must I think be set down to a deeper
                    similarity of emotional atmosphere and intension in the two authors—even
                    though that similarity may have sprung and no doubt largely did spring out of
                    the personal influence of one upon the other. Anyhow our temperaments,
                    standpoints, antecedents, etc., are so entirely diverse and opposite that,
                    except for a few points, I can hardly imagine that there is much real
                    resemblance to be traced. Whitman's full-blooded, copious, rank, masculine style
                    must always make him one of the world's great originals..." (xviii). Rolleston
                    reviewed the second edition of Carpenter's book in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dublin
                        University Review</span>, 2 (April 1886), 319–328. After some prefatory
                    remarks on Whitman and his place in literature "as reputable and assured as that
                    of any of his contemporaries," he analyzes the principal poem, "Towards
                    Democracy." He calls Carpenter a "disciple" of Whitman who "is ready to follow
                    his master's feet in their strangest and most difficult wanderings." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
