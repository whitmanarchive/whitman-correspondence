         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> have been thinking much of you lately &amp; wondering where you were (for I heard some time since that you had left Washington), when the N.Y.

If this reaches you, please let me

               know your address, &amp; I will try to send you something to help along your good work.  I sent you, some time last summer, by private hands, a copy of "Great Expectations" &amp; two dollars in money, but could never learn that they reached you:  did they?  How are you now?</p>

                    was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
                    Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
                    Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
                    Eldridge edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He again met Whitman
                    in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Secretary Chase in order to
                    gather material for his biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Ferry Boy and the
                        Financier</span> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described their meetings
                    in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story, with recollections of noted persons</span>
                    (Boston: Houghton and Mifflin, 1903), 360–401. On December 11, Trowbridge
                    had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending Whitman; see the <a href="nar.00002">January 10,
                    1863</a>. Though
                    Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to O'Connor in 1867: "Every
                    year confirms my earliest impression, that no book has approached the power and
                    greatness of this book, since the Lear and Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A.
                    Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>,
                    23 [1951–52], 327). For Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace
                    Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New York: Rowman

                    stayed with Whitman in Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William
                    D. O'Connor. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00874_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00874_n2"><span>Dr. Le Baron Russell

                    citizens, Russell sent Whitman money to be used in easing the suffering of the
