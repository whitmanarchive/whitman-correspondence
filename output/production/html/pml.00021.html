                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Although your letter I see has the N. Y. post office stamp, Mar. 25, I have only just
                rec'd it, (2 o'clock Wednesday P.M.)—I have talked with Thomas Harlan<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a>—he treated me very
                well. My impression is, there is little or no chance of getting Congress to pass, at
                this time, a special resolution or law putting the ruffles on the list of
                exempts—There is no Committee of Ways &amp; Means yet appointed in the H[ouse]
                of R[epresentatives]—True, any member could offer such a Bill, &amp; if it had
                powerful influence, they <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">might</span> suspend the rules &amp; pass
                it—but there are too many, both in House &amp; Senate, who would almost
                certainly object—one objection would be that ruffles are matters of extra
                ornament &amp;c. &amp;c. and ought to pay a tax, if any thing does<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Still, I will try what I can do—I will see a few of the members,
                forthwith—I have one in my mind, I think may be the best one I can get to
                offer a Bill, &amp; if he is willing, we will try it on—Had I known it when
                the Committee &amp; House were cooking the Bill, I have no doubt I could have got it
                put in with the ¶ including shirt-bosoms, &amp;c.—But that's poor
                consolation.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new or important with me. I am well as usual, &amp; working the
                same, (not much.) Love to Helen and Emmy &amp; all.</p>

                    to Abby Price's letter of <a href="yal.00378">March 25, 1867</a>, in which
                    she made a tempting offer: "I write now in great haste to ask your assistance in
                    behalf of Our Ruffle Manufacture and if you succeed in doing what we ask, or in
                    getting it done I am authorized to offer you a 1000 dollar check as soon as it
                    is done! think of that. Tis only a simple act of Justice that we ask either." As
                    a dressmaker, Price feared the effect on her business of a projected tax on
                    ruffles; see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> (New
