                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Although your letter I see has the N. Y. post office stamp, Mar. 25, I have only just
                rec'd it, (2 o'clock Wednesday P.M.)—I have talked with Thomas Harlan—he treated me very
                well. My impression is, there is little or no chance of getting Congress to pass, at
                this time, a special resolution or law putting the ruffles on the list of
                exempts—There is no Committee of Ways &amp; Means yet appointed in the H[ouse]
                of R[epresentatives]—True, any member could offer such a Bill, &amp; if it had
                powerful influence, they <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">might</span> suspend the rules &amp; pass
                it—but there are too many, both in House &amp; Senate, who would almost
                certainly object—one objection would be that ruffles are matters of extra
                ornament &amp;c. &amp;c. and ought to pay a tax, if any thing does—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Still, I will try what I can do—I will see a few of the members,
                forthwith—I have one in my mind, I think may be the best one I can get to
                offer a Bill, &amp; if he is willing, we will try it on—Had I known it when
                the Committee &amp; House were cooking the Bill, I have no doubt I could have got it
                put in with the ¶ including shirt-bosoms, &amp;c.—But that's poor
                consolation.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing new or important with me. I am well as usual, &amp; working the
                same, (not much.) Love to Helen and Emmy &amp; all.</p>
