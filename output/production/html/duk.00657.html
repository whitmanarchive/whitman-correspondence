        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Charley,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I have now been a week here, &amp; am about the same—well enough to keep up and around, 
        but with bad spells most every day, &amp; sometimes very bad ones. My head does not get 
        right, that being still the trouble—the feeling now being as if it were in the 
        centre of the head, heavy &amp; painful &amp; quite pervading—locomotion about the same—no better. I keep pretty good spirits, however, &amp; still make my calculations on getting well.</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am pleasantly situated here—have two nice rooms, second floor, with windows north 
        &amp; south, if there is any air. They are the rooms in which my mother died, 
        with all the accustomed furniture, I have long been so used to see. 
        I am quite satisfied here, so far—Sleep good, &amp; appetite sufficient. 
        It has been warm weather here, but I have stood it fairly. I hear by your letter 
        &amp; the papers it has been very oppressively hot in Washington. Today, as I write, 
        it is cloudy &amp; cooler here. I have not felt well enough yet to strike out for Atlantic City.</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, I rec'd your letter Saturday, with the one enclosed. (It was a very kind 
        sympathetic note from Kate Hillard.)<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I have written to Harry Douglas, my fellow clerk in the office, 
        asking him to send me my letters here under frank from the office, till July 1st—I am glad to hear Nelly is feeling better—I hope quite well—I send my best love to her—please hand her this letter to read—Nelly, I still feel that I shall pull through, 
        but O it is a weary, weary pull—&amp; when I have these spells in the head that still afflict me, 
        it requires all my phlegm. My lift at the Ashton's was a great help to me—the change from the 15th st. rooms, &amp; then the weather being so favorable—the change here is so far good, too—As soon as I get a little stronger, 
        &amp; free from head-distress, I shall go down to Atlantic City—Remember me to Dr. Drinkard 
        if you see him, &amp; if you have a good chance, read to him what I have said of my case—if he has any suggestions, write me—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Charley, I have amused myself with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kenelm Chilinglly</span>—read it all—like it well—Bulwer is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">such a snob</span> as almost redeems snobdom—the story is good, 
        &amp; the style a master's—Like Cervantes, Bulwer's old-age-productions 
        are incomparably his best. Send me a Chronicle occasionally.
      </p>

                    Whitman of <a href="loc.01323">September 13, 1871</a>, Moncure D. Conway
                    quoted from a letter sent to him by Katharine Hillard (1839?–1915): "I
                    have made a discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is,
                    that I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied
                    I enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the
                    only one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
                    continue beyond." The first meeting of the poet Katharine Hillard with Whitman
                    took place on February 28, 1876, referenced in Whitman's <a href="nyp.00319">February 29, 1876</a> letter to Ellen M. O'Connor. A Brooklyn resident,
                    Hillard was a friend of Abby Price (see Whitman's <a href="pml.00040">September 9, 1873</a> letter to Price); in fact, according to Louisa Van
                    Velsor Whitman's letter to Helen Price on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected
                    that Arthur Price and Katharine Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library).
                    She was also the translator of Dante's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Banquet</span> (1889) and
                    the editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Abridgement . . . of The Secret Doctrine . .
                        . by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky</span> (1907). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
