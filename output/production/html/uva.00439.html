            <p class="tei_p">Every thing is going on &amp; has gone on satisfactorily—My book is finished in
                the type setting &amp; plate-casting, &amp; if things turn out wrong any way I
                shall have only myself to blame, for I have had my own way in every thing—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Spent a few days at Concord—had the good luck to light on the most blessed time
                that Emerson has had of late years—the old man came to see me Saturday
                evening, &amp; made a long stay—Sunday he &amp; Mrs
                E gave me a dinner—every thing just as it should be, &amp; just suited
                me—I think Emerson more significant &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">glorified</span> in
                his present condition than any of his former days—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Joaquin Miller is here—I am with him every day—Longfellow has been to see
                me—I have met O W Holmes, Henry James Sr &amp;c—Should like to come on to N Y <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">abt</span>​  1st of October, &amp; stay at your house a week or ten days—Write me
