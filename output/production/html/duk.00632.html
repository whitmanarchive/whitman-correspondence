                    or 14, 1873. On an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not
                    reproduced here), Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter only "near the end,"
                    and Edwin Haviland Miller dated it May 12 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    219, n. 80). Because Walt Whitman acknowledged a letter from his mother on May
                    16, this letter dates to one or two days later than Miller's date. Walt
                    acknowledged a Wednesday letter from his mother and a Thursday letter from
                    Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman in his <a href="yal.00417">May 16, 1873</a>
                    letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. According to Walt, the "letter from Sister
                    Lou written Thursday morning ... gives me great relief." In her May 15 letter
                    (not extant) Louisa Orr had reported that "Sunday [May 11] was your worst day."
                    If Walt received a letter written Thursday morning that described his mother's
                    relief, it is unlikely that she had recovered enough from the Sunday (May 11)
                    episode, presumably a stroke, to write on Monday. Walt most likely referred to
                    this letter when he wrote "got your letter (Thursday)." Therefore, as Walt
                    probably received this letter on Thursday, May 15, it dates to May 13 or May 14,
                    1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
                    reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see
