            <p class="tei_p">I have yours of 22<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>. I am glad you are coming round to the Hospital scheme. It is (of all others) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the</span>
                scheme for you. You may live for years, you cannot get much (if any) stronger and
                may get much more helpless. In a good hospital you would be surrounded by absolutely
                capable attendants (doctors and nurses) and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">whatever</span>
                happened you would be properly cared for and made as comfortable as skill and
                science could make you. I know your powers of endurance, they are (like the rest of
                your faculties) out of the line of ordinary. But what use to tax them unnecessarily?
                I believe with care and skill properly directed you might even

            yet have many a good week and month while I fear as at present situated you have
                mighty few. I will make enquiry about Johns Hopkins (that is a palace of medical
                skill and physical comfort for the sick and helpless) Baltimore and let you know. If
                a change is decided on I shall go on and see you moved and settled. Don't forget to
                send me the "poemet." Where is Symonds letter? I should like much to see
                    Steads "Review of Reviews" please send it. I think you are
                right not to trouble about the money (income) matter. If money is needed it will be
                found.</p>
