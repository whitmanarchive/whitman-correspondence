            <p class="tei_p">I have mailed you and registered there. the following Books and printed matter. a Copy of "the Bhagavad Gita" 
                Thompson's translations. (a recent Edition.) Selections from the

      </span></span> by John Muir D.D. a lecture on 
                English Literature by a Unitarian Minister of Birkenhead (to whom I gave a copy 
                of the Complete Edition of your Poems) lastly the Supplement to our town's paper. I would like you to look over 
                a Sketch by H.C. Andersen on two Candles, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">its​ </span><span class="tei_corr">it's​

                translated by one of your readers here. the other is a Story from Iceland being the first story in said 
                paper, it is also written by a warm friend of yours, he was once Editor of the paper but is now engaged in a 
                larger paper in a neighbouring town. a paper that is quite in advance of all our papers here about entitled 
                the Newcastle Chronicle it has got a Daily as well as weekly issue. I will send you a copy someday of the weekly
                one so that you may gauge its power and its principles. and also

                contrast it with your own papers for I think there is large room for improvement in—many of them I see.
                they seem to contain matters of such trivial interest outside of the district they are issued in, now I think 
                your papers ought as a rule to be universal in a <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">lare​ </span><span class="tei_corr">large​

      </span></span> topics. if your
                National poetry to a large extent is intensely European I think the papers to large extent are essentially 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">local</span> in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">there​ </span><span class="tei_corr">their​

                this lands. "the Gita" is one of my favourite Books, it is the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gem</span> of all Indian lore.
                it is as <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">wide</span> in its teachings and runs deep too as anything I have ever yet seen 
                in printed Book. I have tried hard to induce a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">few souls</span> 
                to aid in the issue of a cheap universal Edition of it. but have utterly failed. its present publisher been

                Carlyle and my own nature too and lastly to you and your teachings. how can one but feel 
                interested and moved by such a Nature and then I ask? How comes the distance in such life as 
                own such Souls? <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">We We</span> poor mortals sit in 
                judgement on such—who know nothing of the nature or the environments of such. 
                I pause in my thoughts on all such, and gaze on them in wonderment—even with awe and silence too.—</p>

                your sketch of him in the Storm tossed vessel is very very awful real and true. it made me tremble while I read

                Burns who lives in London wants a copy. he has seen the one you 
                sent me in 1869. Now lastly I feel glad to see in our papers you have seen Conway again, 
                I once spent a little time pleasantly with him in London in 1873. He's a right noble free spoken man, full of 
                wise helpful energy of all sorts in his neighborhood in London. I regretted his notes on you was so very brief.
