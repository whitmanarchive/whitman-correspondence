                    as Scotland's national poet. An early Romantic poet who wrote in both Scots and
                    English (often though not exclusively inflected by Scottish dialect), Burns is
                    perhaps best known for his poems "Auld Lang Syne," "Tam o' Shanter" and "To a
                    Mouse" (from which the title of John Steinbeck's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Of Mice and
                        Men</span> is derived). Of Burns, Whitman wrote in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
                        Boughs</span>: "Though so much is to be said in the way of fault-finding,
                    drawing black marks, and doubtless severe literary criticism . . . after full
                    retrospect of his works and life, the aforesaid 'odd-kind chiel' remains to my
                    heart and brain as almost the tenderest, manliest, and (even if contradictory)
                    dearest flesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone
                    poets." For Whitman's full opinion of Burns as it appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span>, see "Robert Burns as Poet and Person," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1888),
