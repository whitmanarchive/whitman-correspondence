                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,

                    Burroughs). The lot with the carpenter's shop, which belonged to Smith, was on

                        1867</a> letter to Walt). Louisa asked Walt about purchasing the shop as a

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of

                    postscript runs vertically in the right margin of the first page. The piece to
                    which the postscript refers is Walt Whitman's "Democracy" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> 4 [December 1867], 919–33, reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span> [Washington, 1871]). Walt Whitman announced the
                    completion of "Democracy" to Francis P. Church and William C. Church in his <a href="nyp.00271">October 13, 1867</a> letter and forwarded a copy the
                    following week. He presumably reported to Louisa that he had completed
                    "Democracy" in the letter that she received on October 9, 1867 (see
                    above). </span></span> [<a href="#r9">back</a>]</li></ul>
