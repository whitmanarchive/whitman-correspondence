            <p class="tei_p">Your contribution of $20 for the soldiers in hospital, sick or wounded, has been received—&amp; I thank you for it most sincerely. I shall apply it to their aid, faithfully &amp; with care.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was out to Harewood yesterday week, &amp; last Sunday—the patients have however since been removed to another place, near the Old Douglas hospital. Then there are the Providence hospital, &amp; the 5th Reg. Cavalry, &amp; some other small, military hospitals.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There are comparatively few soldiers now that need ministering to, but full enough to occupy one's spare hours—&amp; especially as half of the inmates of the hospitals are discharged soldiers, drawing no pay, though sick, or suffering sometimes very deeply indeed, from relapses of old wounds.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you health, my friend, in body &amp; in spirit. Farewell.</p>
