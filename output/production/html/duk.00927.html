            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">Yours came right. I am still imprison'd in my sick room, yet sitting up &amp; reading
                &amp; writing &amp; (in limits) talking &amp; being talked to—It is all
                tedious &amp; long drawn out—the worst no prospect of real improvement—I
                mean in any body or leg strength, wh' is very low indeed—but my spirits
                &amp;c. sort o' fair—appetite &amp; sleep not bad considering—I do not
                want any thing, comfort or necessity, I crave for—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall print the little booklet <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> 140
                pp.—and at same time a big Vol. (900 pages) comprehending <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> my stuff—verses &amp; prose—bound in one—Shall send
                you copies soon as ready—will be a few weeks yet—I hear from Dr
                B[ucke], O'C[onnor], and J[ohn]
                B[urroughs]—I get the Transcripts &amp; thank for
                them—Traubel unspeakably faithful &amp; kind—</p>
