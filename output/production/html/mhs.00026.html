                <p class="tei_p">Well Lou Dear, I suppose you got my letter from St. Louis, here I am on the
                    great plains of Colorado (and Kansas)—We ride and ride all day &amp; all
                    night, &amp; it is nothing but plains—but I enjoy it all very much
                    indeed—as I sit in the cars writing this, (have a leaf-table before me to
                    write on) 1 p m flying along, I can <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_damage tei_gap_quantity_5 tei_gap_unit_chars">[damage]</span> p with
                    my eye, including both sides, a radius [t]wo hundred miles—emigrant
                    wagons—quite frequently herds <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_damage tei_gap_quantity_2 tei_gap_unit_chars">[damage]</span> cattle, some large
                    ones—settlements 15 or 20 miles apart—no improved farms, no
                    fences—(I mean along here)—but 600 miles of rolling prairie
                    land—the pure cool mountain air delicious to breathe, (it is 3000 feet
                    higher level here than <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​ )—I am in a sleeping car,—(we left St Louis Saturday
                    morning, came through Missouri—staid 4 days in Kansas)—left Topeka
                    yesterday at 5 p m, &amp; will be in Denver this evening—I have got along
                    very well—(two days in Lawrence, Kansas, &amp; two in Topeka)—we are now about 1800 miles or over west of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​ —I have good meals</p>

                <p class="tei_p">—there is a very sick lady aboard the cars—her husband is taking her to
                    Colorado, hoping it will help her—two beautiful little children—she
                    is groaning as I write—</p>
