                    (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
                    children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa

                    December 7, 1869. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "December 7," and
                    Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller cited
                    Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). The concurrence of familial,
                    social, and public matters provides assurance that the year is correct. Henry
                    Clapp, Walt Whitman's friend from Pfaff's Beer Cellar, had resumed contact with
                    Abby and Helen Price earlier in the year. George Washington Whitman had begun
                    repaying loans to both of his brothers, Walt Whitman and Thomas Jefferson
                    Whitman, though his employment as a pipe inspector for the Brooklyn Water Works
                    was somewhat unsettled since the appointment of a new Water Board. Also, the
                    expected appointment of a new attorney general is almost certainly that of
                    Ebenezer R. Hoar. The brief mention of Henry Ward Beecher refers to his
                    involvement in a public scandal known as the Richardson-McFarland affair. In
                    addition, December 7 fell on Tuesday, and that day of the week is consistent
                    with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's surprise that Walt's letter, which she received
                    on Monday morning, was sent on Sunday. Weekend overnight mail delivery from
                    Washington, D.C. to Brooklyn, New York, was unusual but was shocking to Louisa
                    only because the letter was written Sunday afternoon. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00586_n4 note" id="duk.00586_n4"><span>Walt Whitman's December 5,

                    delivery service, was noted for its fast delivery, trustworthiness, and its

                    larger sums of money both during and after the war, but Walt Whitman generally
                    sent his mother smaller sums via the postal service. George Washington Whitman
                    was repaying in installments a loan that Walt had made to him when George was
                    struggling financially in his speculative housebuilding business. For Louisa Van

                    the Pfaff's restaurant and beer cellar in lower Manhattan. Clapp was the editor

                    daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
                    daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
                    movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
                    the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
                    1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
                    letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice

                    Clapp, Jr., was to "put up at lessey[?] farlands." The quizzical phrase "lessey
                    farlands" in that letter may refer to same place as "falanks" in this letter.
                    She may refer to a boarding house, or the phrase may be yet another alternate

                    (1813–1887), Congregational clergyman and brother of Harriet Beecher
                    Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847, and he
                    became one of America's most influential ministers. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
                    son Edward Whitman attended Beecher's church regularly. Louisa may be
                    paraphrasing a short newspaper article, which remarked that Beecher was "getting
                    it all around" ("The News," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>,
                    December 6, 1869, 2). This late-1869 scandal, known as the Richardson-McFarland
                    matter, targeted Beecher because he had performed a deathbed marriage ceremony
                    for the prominent New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> correspondent Albert
                    Richardson. Richardson was shot in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> office by

                    Indiana with divorce papers, Daniel McFarland shot Richardson. The ensuing
                    public scandal targeted Beecher: he was accused of endorsing bigamy because

                    including Chloe Beach and Elizabeth Tilton were fodder for Brooklyn gossip, and

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    Moses Lane, chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works, resigned shortly after
                    the new board was seated. For details on the new water board and the anxiety

                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
