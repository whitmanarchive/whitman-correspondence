                yesterday, &amp; hereby rec't &amp; thank you for. I am still living here, not much

                printing a little Vol: under the title of "November Boughs"—also of bringing
                out a complete budget of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> my writing in one book. I remember you with much love—</p>
