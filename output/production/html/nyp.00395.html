                   during the American Civil War. He was the son of William H.
                    Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
                    his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s <a href="nyp.00157">January 9, 1864</a>,
                    letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H

                    Whitman on <a href="nyp.00176">January 12, 1865</a>, thanking him for his
                    letter (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find
                    words to tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live
                    to meet again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in

                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office.
