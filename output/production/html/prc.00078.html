                    W H Rolleston | Lange Strasse 29 | Dresden | Saxony. It is postmarked: Camden,
                    N.J. | Dec | 1(?) | (?). The address and the text of the note were cut out and
                    pasted on the flyleaves of Rolleston's copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>. Whitman's signature appears in the lower left corner of the
                    address. On the flyleaf below the text Rolleston wrote: "The edition here
                    alluded to was published by Osgood &amp; Co. Boston, in 1882. The present volume
                    is a reprint of it." The reprint to which Rolleston refers was published by
                    David McKay in Philadelphia in 1882. Since, from the end of 1881 through 1882,
                    Rolleston lived in Dresden at 29 Lange Strasse, the address of the letter card,
                    and in 1883 moved to 28 Terrassen Ufer, 1882 must be the year in which this card
                    was written. The month, December, is clearly visible on the postmark, and so is
                    "1," the first number of the date. Rolleston's letter of <a href="loc.05151">December 26, 1882</a>, acknowledges the receipt of Whitman's card of
                    December 10, and according to Whitman's Commonplace Book, Whitman sent Rolleston
                    "full set loose leaves L of G. with postal card" on December 10, 1882 (Charles
                    E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
                    of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The date of this note should therefore be
                    December 10, 1882. For Rolleston's letters to Whitman in 1882, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</span>, ed. Horst
