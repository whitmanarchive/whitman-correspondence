                    from a long Western journey, I found your note respecting Mr. Whitman. The bad
                    feature of the affair to me is that it requires prompt action, which I cannot
                    use. I go to-day to Montreal to be gone a week, and I have found quite
                    tyrannical necessities at home for my attention. Not to do nothing I have just
                    written a note to Mr. F. N. Knapp at Washington, who, I am told, ought to know
                    what you tell me, and may know how to employ Mr. Whitman's beneficial agency in
                    some official way in the hospitals.<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> As soon as I return home, I shall make
                    some trial whether I can find any direct friends and abettors for him and his
                    beneficiaries, the soldiers. I hear gladly all that you say of him.
                    Respectfully, Mr. Redpath.<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span>

                    an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman

                    Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."

                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
                    John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
                    years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who
                    deserved something better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to
                    hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the
                    presence of Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a
                    single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have
                    seldom been equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was
                    the first, and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided
                    people arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were
                    against Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
                    collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
                    flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
                    memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton,
                    1910] pp. 513). For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. Of the O'Connors, Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman wrote on <a href="loc.00415">June 13, 1863</a>: "I am
                    real glad, my dear Walt, that you are among such good people. I hope it will be
                    in the power of some of our family to return their kindness some day. I'm sure
                    twould be done with a heartfelt gratitude. Tis pleasant, too, to think, that
                    there are still people of that kind left." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01007_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01007_n4"><span>Charles W. Eldridge was one
