                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                        <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
                    Phyllis Theroux, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Book of Eulogies</span> [New York: Simon
                    &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30). </span></span> [<a href="#r0839">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02917_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.02917_n1"><span>William Ewart Gladstone
                    (1809–1898) was a British politician, serving as Prime Minister for four
                    separate terms. The essay Macculloch mentions responds to Ingersoll's "Letter to
                    Dr. Field," which appeared in the January 1888 issue. Near its conclusion,
                    Ingersoll asserts his agnostic views, "Neither in the interest of truth, nor for
                    the benefit of man, is it necessary to assert what we do not know. No cause is
                    great enough to demand a sacrifice of candor. The mysteries of life and death,
                    of good and evil, have never yet been solved." In response, Gladstone writes,
                    "How good, how wise are these words! But coming at the close of the controversy,
                    have they not some of the ineffectual features of a death-bed repentance?"
                    Ingersoll's June letter furthered the debate then being promoted by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The North American Review</span> as the Ingersoll-Gladstone
