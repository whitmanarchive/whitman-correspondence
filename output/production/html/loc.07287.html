                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                        possible to reconstruct the general nature of these letters.</p><p class="tei_p">On <a href="loc.07536">December 27, 1888</a>, Whitman wrote Bucke: "have
                        rec'd yours of 24th, &amp; note carefully what you say of food, alcohol,
                        &amp;c, and of the effete wretchedness—all thoroughly judged &amp;

                        so—&amp; glad to get it."</p><p class="tei_p">The extant Bucke letter to Whitman of
                        December 24 contains no mention of diet. It would appear that Bucke wrote
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">two</span> letters to Whitman that day—something
                        which he did on occasion (e.g. <a href="loc.07273">November 28,
                            1888</a>, and <a href="loc.07274">later that same evening</a>).
                        On December 29, 1888, Bucke wrote Traubel: "I have urged the warm bath,
                        medicine, moderate diet (almost starvation diet is safest for him) he has
                        answered my letter and says he will attend to what I say" (Feinberg). Bucke
                        is referring to the letter Whitman wrote on <a href="loc.07536">December
                            27, 1888</a>. Some further evidence of the content of this letter is
                        provided by Traubel:</p><p class="tei_p">"Among the letters W. gave me yesterday [December
                        27, 1888] was one from Bucke very specific about W.'s diet. W. said
                        to-night: 'It is—yes it is—a very good letter: I am conscious it
                        should be obeyed. I know no one better able to say these things than Bucke.'
                        Bucke had advised that the letter be shown to Walsh, who could give more
                        direct instructions. W. has not done this: it is doubtful if he will, though
                        he may" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
                            <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.58.html">Friday, December 28, 1888</a>).</p><p class="tei_p">It is more difficult to
                        reconstruct the nature of Bucke's letter to Whitman of December 26,
                        1888.</p><p class="tei_p">On <a href="loc.07537">December 29, 1888</a>, Whitman
                        wrote Bucke: "y'rs of 26th came last evn'g—Yes, I shall <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">mind</span>—think I understand &amp; accept the matter
                        below it, &amp; shall practically put it in action."</p><p class="tei_p">[Lozynsky goes on
                        to argue that] Bucke's letter of December 26 was a follow-up to his letter
                        of the 24th concerning diet. In his December 29 letter, Whitman may be
                        reassuring Bucke that he intends to keep the promise made in his letter of
                        the 27th. The fact that both these letters are missing suggests a link
                        between them. They were put aside either for consultation about specific
                        details or, as Traubel mentions, for presentation to Dr. Walsh. [Note copied

                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the
