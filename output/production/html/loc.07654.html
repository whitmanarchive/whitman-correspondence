            <p class="tei_p">I am about the same—Strangely somehow I don't get any more power in my body or
                legs—I feel pretty well—have written one or two pieces for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span>—&amp; they have printed as before—I have
                not left the room up stairs yet (now nine weeks)—the Doctor thinks it not best
                yet—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My little booklet <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> is ab't done—concludes
                with quite a long but very hurried &amp; scratchy paper on "Elias Hicks"—done
                mostly when I was sickest all, &amp; thought it best to hurry it done right
                off—But at present I am much as of late years, except my legs &amp; getting
                around even the room—wh' I sometimes fancy is not even coming back.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Love to Jess. I have got a few lines from Jeff (in St Louis)—I am now sitting in the big
                chair—Spend most of the day here—had my dinner a little ago—now
                5½—cool &amp; clear &amp; pleasant to-day—I am quite
                comfortable—Hope this will find you feeling well—Rain'd like fury nearly
                all yesterday—Mrs. D[avis] intended going
                yesterday—I was favorable to her going—</p>
