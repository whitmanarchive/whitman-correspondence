                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.

                    "Rain'd like fury yesterday." Two pieces, "Over and Through the Burial Chant"
                    and a prose "tribute to Sheridan," had recently appeared in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> (see Whitman's letter of <a href="loc.07653">August 10-11</a> to Richard Maurice Bucke). Jessie, Thomas Jefferson

                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the

                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in
