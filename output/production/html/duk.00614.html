                    February 11 and February 13, 1873. The most probable date is February 12, 1873.
                    Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter February 1, 1873, but its topical
                    consistency and verbal echoes of letters from both Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                    Whitman and Walt Whitman sets the range of possible dates between February 11
                    and February 13. February 12?, 1873, the date proposed by Edwin Haviland Miller,
                    is most probable (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). The letter reports that
                    Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's coughing is "somewhat easier," probably in
                    echo of a similar phrase in Jeff's February 7, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dear
                        Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</span> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
                    State University Press, 1984], 154). Louisa observes that Walt "will be glad to
                    get out in the open air once more," and she seems to echo Walt's hope that he
                    can "get out—or to the front door, at any rate" (see his <a href="yal.00410">February 10, 1873</a> letter to Louisa). Finally, Walt
                    acknowledged that he "rec'd your letter Saturday" (February 14) in his <a href="yal.00412">February 17, 1873</a> reply. Louisa had received both
                    Jeff's February 7 letter and Walt's February 10 letter, and Walt received this
                    letter on February 14. Therefore, this letter dates between February 11 and
                    February 13, 1873. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Whitman died on February 19, 1873 from complications associated with a throat
                    ailment. Mattie and her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had two
                    daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved
                    to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
                    Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
                    emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa. For more on Mattie,
                    see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie: The Letters of Martha

                    1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause of death as
                    cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying bronchial
                    symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Now the

                        Whitman's number 7 is ambiguous, but her phrase "somewhat esier [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>]" echoes Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
                        February 7, 1873 letter to Louisa (see Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price,

                        Louis and a nationally recognized name. He married wife Mattie in 1859, and
                        Louisa had shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for St.

                    paralytic stroke on January 23, 1873. See his <a href="yal.00410">February

                    whether his mother thought Walt Whitman would be able to visit St. Louis, and he
                    cautioned her, "you must not be surprised to hear that it is all over with the
                    dear soul at any time." Two days later, Jeff added Mattie Whitman "speaks often
                    and much about you—wants to see you very, very much" (see his February 5,

                    Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
                    Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
                    contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
