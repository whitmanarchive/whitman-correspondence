            <p class="tei_p">Here is the Preface—three printed slips, copies—not so much of preface to
                the tales but my memorial &amp; reminiscence of dear W[illiam]—&amp; to give a dash of appropriate &amp; something (I hardly can say what
                but I think I know) different or varied to the book—</p>

                physiological likely)—but almost a complete bodily wreck, cannot get across
                the room without holding on to something or being led—have a stout man
                nurse—go out doors in wheel chair

                still rejected by all the magazines—my right arm power &amp; volition good
                yet—appetite, sleep &amp;c: fair—am now well on my 72d year—have
                the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">grip</span> rather bad—cool spell of weather
