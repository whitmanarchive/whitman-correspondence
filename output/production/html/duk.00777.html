            <p class="tei_p">Tommy, your letter come to hand this evening, &amp; I will just scratch off a few lines to
                answer at once—for I am ever so glad to know you have not forgot me, as I have
                not you, Tommy boy. I heard by some London boy I met quite a while ago that you was
                married &amp; I supposed since you had your hands full of business, new associations
                &amp;c.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tom, I will just tell you about things—I still live in the same quarters in
                Camden, but shall soon break up permanently from here. I keep pretty well—feel
                as well as when I last saw you, &amp; I suppose look <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  the same—(perhaps grayer &amp; redder)—though young enough <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">in spirit</span> &amp; now in my 65th year, I could easily pass for
                75 or so—Ups and downs of course, but I thank God I have had two pretty good
                years—&amp; especially this past summer (which has been a remarkably fine one
                here.) My two books bring me in a moderate income—I am satisfied with very plain living—&amp; bless the Lord I am
                likely to have enough for that as long as I need—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tom, give my best regards to your wife, for all I have no acquaintance with her
                yet—I wish to be remembered to any of the Asylum boys I knew there who yet
                remain—I remember well the kindness of them all, &amp; the gay old rides
                around—Tom, do you recollect that Sunday evening you drove the women in town
                to church, &amp; we had a sociable drive all around?—that was the time we
                first got acquainted—I have been thinking a good while of coming on to visit
                Dr Bucke again, &amp; then I will come &amp; see you—God bless you, Tommy boy—</p>
