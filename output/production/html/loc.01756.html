                <span class="tei_salute">Dear son Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still doing as well as when I last wrote—I have many alternations, but upon the whole 
                have no reason to complain of the last ten days. My head has some bad spells, 
                &amp; a touch or more nearly every day, &amp; my locomotion is still as clumsy as ever—but for all that I am happy in not having any of those spasms of three weeks since, 
                &amp; indeed I have <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">glimpses</span> again of my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">real self</span>—have had two or three such, 
                of an hour or two each—which I felt very encouraging. Your letter came Tuesday, 
                &amp; I wrote you a few lines on a postal card, which I suppose you rec'd next day. 
                I went to Tommy Osler's, the young RR man's funeral last Sunday—it was near here—poor fellow, he used always to stop a minute at the window, 
                &amp; talk off hand &amp; cheerful—Pete he often made me think of you, dear son—he was your age &amp; size—he was an only son—I go out now about every day, 
                my strength is certainly improving—shall go out this afternoon—</p>
            
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01756.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01756.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01756.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">About an hour ago the big Adams Express wagon drove up to the door, with a box for me—it was 2 doz 2 lb cans of fresh Oregon salmon from St. Louis, from my brother Jeff—I am very fond of it for breakfast, can eat it every day—(My appetite is pretty fair, 
                but I must have just the things I want, cant eat any others)—Pete your description 
                of the old Evangelical Alliance fellows, as if they had just walked out of Noah's Ark, 
                made me laugh heartily—you just hit it—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have just got a long letter from Mrs. O'Connor—she is in Massachusetts—returns to Washington in November—How are Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash, &amp; Ed, &amp; all—give them my love—tell Ed I shall yet want him to build me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that small house</span>—I send my love to Wash Milburn—I am writing this up in my room, 3 o'clock, 
                pleasant weather, sun shining, window open—I am feeling quite fair to-day. 
                
            </p>

            <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">Good bye for this time, my loving boy.</span>
