                but walt the next is mary
                has
                written to know if they can come here
                for a week as minne is going to
                be married
                and they want to get
                some things she wants me to write if
                its conveinent to let them come
                she says they will get their own
                grub so i suppose it would be
                best to let them come or have an
                everlasting coldness between us all
                walter dear i dont like to impose
                on good nature but walt if you
                could send me the order the first
                of next week i would be glad
                as my other sons dont seem to think money
                is nessessary for me to have george
                and loo
                is coming the 1 of the month
