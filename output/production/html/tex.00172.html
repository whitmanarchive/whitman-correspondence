                    September 15 and September 26, 1871. The letter dates to mid- or late-September
                    1871 based on the approaching visit of Mary Isadore "Minnie" Van Nostrand and
                    family. Minnie was the younger daughter of Mary Elizabeth Van Nostrand, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman's elder daughter. Louisa was anxious about the Van Nostrands'
                    visit because her daughter Mary proposed that she, her husband Ansel, and two
                    daughters would spend approximately a week in Brooklyn to shop in preparation
                    for Minnie's upcoming marriage on October 17. Louisa acquiesced to the proposal,
                    and the visit began on September 27 (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00584">September 28, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman). A late-September date for
                    this letter is corroborated by Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's visit to
                    Brooklyn in fall 1871. Though two of Walt Whitman's letters to his mother and a
                    letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" to Jeff are mentioned, which if available
                    could narrow the range of dates, not one of the letters is extant. Randall H.
                    Waldron dated the letter "about September 17, 1871" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mattie:

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,

                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
