            <p class="tei_p">I write mainly to see whether I have got the right address—to find whether this reaches you—If so please give me an answer as soon as convenient.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As you see, I am still in Washington—have a small place in the Attorney General's office—pleasant, agreeable, &amp;c. but pretty moderate pay. My health has been good—&amp; I have got through the hot weather all right—It is a long while since I have heard from you—&amp; indeed it is nearly a year since I have been in New York—Direct to me Attorney Gen's. office, Washington—I expect to come north soon for a short time—Love to Helen, Emily, Arthur &amp; all.</p>
