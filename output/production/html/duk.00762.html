                    Longfellow was published in Cambridge, Mass., in 1882. In an undated letter,
                    written in late May or early June, Kennedy referred to the Boston censorship: "I
                    know you are as serene as a mountain, though you are a grand old god, with all
                    your faults. . . . It has taken me three years to get y'r parallax &amp;
                    calculate your dimensions" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                    Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
