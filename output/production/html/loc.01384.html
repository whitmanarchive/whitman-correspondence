            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very, very glad to get thy postal card &amp; thy congratulations on the birth
                of our second little daughter, who is two months old today. We
                have just brought her back from the country, where we all had a most delightful
                Easter holiday. How thee would have enjoyed our drives! The fields &amp; lanes were
                starred with primroses &amp; daffodils, &amp; <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01384.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01384.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01384.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>the hedges were just breaking into
                bloom. The air was fragrant &amp; warm &amp; the birds seemed intoxicated with joy
                at the return of Spring. The English country is so beautiful—it is different,
                too, from anything we can see at home. There is a mellow historical air brooding
                over everything—the old common lands, dating from Saxon times—which are
                beautiful even if they are not useful in an agricultural sense—the quaint old
                rambling villages with mossy thatched roofs, clustering <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01384.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01384.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01384.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>about the gates of some lordly
                park, of whose castle or gabled Manor House one can catch glimpses through the
                magnificent trees—I do not say I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">approve</span> of grand
                castles &amp; dependent villages—or even of so much waste land. But I enjoy it
                even more than an Englishman could, I think, since I don't feel responsible for its
                existence.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have come back again to work, political, legal, &amp; social—&amp; of these
                three the hardest is the social.

                kind of amusement which society here offers—which is not amusement at all, but
                a struggle for notoriety.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Little Ray has entered the enchanted land of imagination. She
                lives in "'tories" &amp; "p'etends" &amp; we are in terror of our lives from her
                deadly assaults as a "bear-lion." She usually eats her supper in the character of an
                "efelant" with a "long nose" &amp; a "big mouff," &amp; when she wakes up in the
                night I sometimes find her transformed <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01384.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01384.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01384.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>into a loudly purring "pussy-cat"
                or a wriggling "'nake." Her little sister is still in the mental attitude of an
                oyster—except that on occasion she can do what I believe no animal ever
                did—laugh. But that is not quite true—I can remember one animal who used
                to laugh—Antecellere—the horse I had so many years. He used to laugh
                when I fell off—sometimes he laughed so hard that he would forget to run
                away.</p>

                going to America soon &amp; is so <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very</span> anxious to see thee
                that I ventured to give her a letter to thee. But I told her of thy ill-health &amp;
                warned her that thee might not be well enough to see her—so thee will not

                the burning questions of the day, &amp; is really the old contest between Free Trade
                &amp; Protection, under a new form. I am on the Free Trade side, in spite of my
                American upbringing.</p>
