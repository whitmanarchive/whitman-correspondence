                too, from anything we can see at home. There is a mellow historical air brooding
                over everything—the old common lands, dating from Saxon times—which are
                beautiful even if they are not useful in an agricultural sense—the quaint old

                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
