            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you the second proofs—look over carefully for technicals, misspelling of
                names, &amp; in the Italian text on Page 109 &amp;c—but make no changes or alterations. If we were to begin the setting of the
                copy <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">de novo</span> you should certainly be obeyed in every detail
                &amp; minutest particular—&amp; I know I should like the result well enough.
                But I like wonderfully well the whole presentations just as they appear
                here—&amp; I know you will too, either right off, or soon as you get
                accustomed to them. Besides <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the matter itself</span>, after being
                faithfully given as to text &amp; with typographic cleanliness &amp; propriety, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">makes remaining points not worth dwelling on</span>. Taken together
                the Introductory Letter and the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] are so tremendous &amp;
                vehement, so beautiful &amp; orbic in themselves—so fitting for the body of
                the volume (almost its heart &amp; lungs)—so honest &amp; subtle, as well as
                stupendous, a eulogy and dissertation, on <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G</span>​ , &amp; on certain primary &amp; spinal literary laws—so assuring a
                pedestal for my future fame—&amp; as here printed so satisfactory in their
                type, style &amp; paragraphing &amp;c. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">as they stand</span> that any
                change in those particulars would be worse than unnecessary—would be
                    fatuous—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I keep well—Write me often as you can—tell me all the news—your own
                movements as much as you can—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Did you get the parcel of books?</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Keep the proof <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">two days</span> after you get it if you wish—</p>
