            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you the second proofs—look over carefully for technicals, misspelling of
                names, &amp; in the Italian text on Page 109 &amp;c<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—but make no changes or alterations. If we were to begin the setting of the
                copy <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">de novo</span> you should certainly be obeyed in every detail
                &amp; minutest particular—&amp; I know I should like the result well enough.
                But I like wonderfully well the whole presentations just as they appear
                here—&amp; I know you will too, either right off, or soon as you get
                accustomed to them. Besides <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the matter itself</span>, after being
                faithfully given as to text &amp; with typographic cleanliness &amp; propriety, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">makes remaining points not worth dwelling on</span>. Taken together
                the Introductory Letter and the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] are so tremendous &amp;
                vehement, so beautiful &amp; orbic in themselves—so fitting for the body of
                the volume (almost its heart &amp; lungs)—so honest &amp; subtle, as well as
                stupendous, a eulogy and dissertation, on <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Leaves of Grass​ ">L of G</span>​ , &amp; on certain primary &amp; spinal literary laws—so assuring a
                pedestal for my future fame—&amp; as here printed so satisfactory in their
                type, style &amp; paragraphing &amp;c. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">as they stand</span> that any
                change in those particulars would be worse than unnecessary—would be

                    biography was completed on March 31 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.). This was Whitman's book in every detail: he
                    altered the proofs at will. On March 20, Bucke, whose role was simply to
                    acquiesce in Whitman's changes, wrote: "I open and read these parcels of proof
                    in fear and trembling (you must go as easy as you can, you are the terrible
                    surgeon with the knife &amp; saw and saw the patient). You left out my remarks
                    on 'Children of Adam', I believe they were good but I acquiesce—your
                    additions are excellent as they have been all through" (Feinberg Collection). On
                    May 28 Bucke was pleased with the book he and Whitman had produced: "I believe
                    it will do, and if it will the Editor will deserve more credit than the
                    Author—I am really surprised at the tact and judgement you have displayed
                    in putting my rough <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Manuscript​ ">M. S.</span>​  into shape and I am more than satisfied with all you have done"
                    (Feinberg Collection). Bucke, however, may not have been quite so pleased with
                    Whitman's high-handed treatment of his book as his letters to the poet indicate.
                    For in a letter on August 19 to O'Connor, who on August 16 objected to "several
                    omissions and commissions," Bucke wrote: "I do not care to go into these matters
                    by letter but when you come [to Canada] I will make every thing clear to your
                    comprehention" (The Library of Congress, Washington D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
