            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Just a line as you have been much in my thoughts lately. The Scottish Art Review is
                publishing a review of November Boughs<a href="#n3999" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3999">1</a> next month—by me—and I send you a
                slip.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> The winter keeps very mild here, but gloomy, and we don't see much of the sun.
                I suppose you find your strength waning very much, and don't reckon to be
                long with us now. Mr. Sharpe,<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">3</a> my old harper friend that I told you of, died a few
                days ago—"very quiet &amp; gentle" says his son writing to me. I hope you have not
                much pain dear Walt; we shall miss you so much—but you will perhaps understand
                more about us than we about you.</p>

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
