            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Just a line as you have been much in my thoughts lately. The Scottish Art Review is
                publishing a review of November Boughs next month—by me—and I send you a
                slip. The winter keeps very mild here, but gloomy, and we don't see much of the sun.
                I suppose you find your strength waning very much, and don't reckon to be
                long with us now. Mr. Sharpe, my old harper friend that I told you of, died a few
                days ago—"very quiet &amp; gentle" says his son writing to me. I hope you have not
                much pain dear Walt; we shall miss you so much—but you will perhaps understand
                more about us than we about you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am in London for a week or two. A friend of
                yours, from Belfast, who does not give his name, wants to send the enclosed 22/6 to
                buy you some little thing, now<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01242.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01242.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01242.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> you are ill.
