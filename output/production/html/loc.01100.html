                    (1856–1897) was a politician and lawyer from New York. According to
                    Bruns's death certificate, his parents were born in Germany. In 1878, he married
                    Anastasia "Anna" Kirby (1857–unknown), and the couple had six children.
                    Bruns represented New York County's Fifteenth District in the New York State
                    Assembly for the 1886 term (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Record of Assemblymen and
                        Senators from the City of New York in the Legislature of 1886</span> by the
                    City Reform Club [New York: Burgoyne's "Quick" Print], 37–39). Bruns also
                    seems to have been president of at least two insurance companies, including the
                    Columbian League (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Documents of the Assembly of the State
                        of New York</span>, [Albany: The Troy Press Company, 1889], 246–247) and
                    The Income and Life Association of America (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Our Society
                        Journal</span> [March 1890], 16). He died at his home at 275 Milford Street in
                    Brooklyn and is buried in Calvary cemetery. </span></span></p></div>
