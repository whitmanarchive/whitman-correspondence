                    was the translator of Dante's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Banquet</span> (1889) and the
                    editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret
                        Doctrine: A Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
                        Blavatsky</span> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Whitman's 
                    close friend, the women's rights activist Abby Price
                    (see Whitman's <a href="pml.00040">September 9, 1873</a>, letter to
                    Price). According to a letter from Whitman's mother—Louisa Van Velsor Whitman—to Helen Price
                    on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
                    Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
                    writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his <a href="duk.00657">June 23,
                        1873</a>, letter to his friend, the former publisher and fellow clerk Charles Eldridge. Hillard and Whitman first met in
                    person on February 28, 1876, and Whitman sent her a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> on July 27, 1876  (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Writing
                    to Whitman on <a href="loc.01323">September 13, 1871</a>, Moncure D.
                    Conway, who acted as Whitman's agent in England, quoted from a letter he had received 
                   from Katharine Hillard: "I have made a
                    discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that I never
                    half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed it.
                    To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
                    reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and continue
                    beyond." </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n3">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02311_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.02311_n3"><span>This letter is addressed:

                    of the University of Pennsylvania was appointed state geologist in 1874. He was also
                    secretary of the American Philosophical Society from 1858 to 1885. In 1849,
                    Lesley married Susan Inches Lyman (1823–1904), the daughter of Judge
                    Joseph Lyman (1767–1847) of Northampton, Mass. His daughters were Margaret
