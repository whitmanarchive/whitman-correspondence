                "impromptu criticism" letter <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">corrected</span> has been furnished me
                by the printer after all, &amp; I will send you 15 copies—The cards in the little envelope are my dear friend Mrs: Harned &amp; the new baby boy's, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herbert
                    Spencer</span> H[arned]—both are flourishing
                tip-top. Tom H. comes every day—my brother
                    George also—my sister Lou has
                just visited me this mn'g—Y'r letter came this mn'g—The Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Trans</span>[<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">script</span>] (Kennedy) has a ¶ (Dec: 29) merely narrating that the big Vol. is
                printed &amp; out—I have taken up &amp; find myself curious enough, perhaps
                interested, to probably go thro' Tolstoi's "Confessions"—a strange product of
                our time, from Russia there—it is natural certainly, but morbific—a sort
                of Jack the Ripper treatment applied to himself—it is autobiographic of
                course—pathologic—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It grows cloudy &amp; cooler—have had my ice cream &amp; milk—your good
                letter of Dec: 31 comes—yes "hurrah for
                89!"—letter rec'd from J H Johnston—his new store
                Christmas sales reach'd $45000—I have just scribbled a little 10-line poemet I
                think I'll sent to Century—Am sitting here alone
                by the wood fire—</p>
