                    to one of them I discovered only a few months ago, "The Riddle Song." It means
                    The Spirit—I have lately been looking into Scientific Christianity and find in
                    To You, page 186, that I never saw in this same light,—"These furies, elements,
                    storms, motions of Nature, throes of apparent dissolution, you are he or she who is
                    master or mistress over them, master or mistress in your own right over Nature,

                    "All is Truth"—To Him That was Crucified, The Compost, Passage to India,

                    (1846–1941) was born in Rock Island, Illinois, the daughter of John
                    Liberty Bean and Marilla J. Smith. In 1869, she married Davenport, Iowa,
                    businessman William T. Minchen, and the couple had three children, John Paul,
                    Abigail Louise, and Florence. The Minchen family lived in Carroll, Iowa.
                    According to Minchen's obituary, she was "one of the first to advocate woman's
                    suffrage" and "always intensely interested in all forward looking movements."
                    The obituary also describes Minchen as "an extensive reader" and a member of the
                    Clio Club, a group that founded the Carroll Public Library in 1894. She died at
                    her daughter Florence's home in San Mateo, California, and is buried in Carroll
                    City Cemetery in Carroll, Iowa. For more information, see her obituary, "Mrs. W.
                    T. Minchen, 95, One of the Earliest Settlers Here, Dies in California," in the
