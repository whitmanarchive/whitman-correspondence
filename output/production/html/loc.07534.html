            <p class="tei_p">Well Christmas has come &amp; nearly gone—I hope you &amp; all have enjoyed
                it—Superb weather here now two days—My fair feelings continue, &amp; I
                have had quite a generous slice of turkey with some cranberries for my dinner an
                hour ago &amp; a cup of coffee—the most of a meal for me for four
                months—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Every thing quiet here—some visitors, a young Englishman, Rathbone, son of the man of the address on the "nude" I use in my
                printed piece—&amp; several others—(some of whom I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">declined</span>)—I rec'd a letter (enclosed) from John Burroughs this morn'g—nothing very
                new—I wish you to tell me the tariff and freight of the four books, &amp;
                whether they reach'd you in good order—I have been reading Tolstoi's
                "Sebastopol Sketches," Englished very well by Frank D. Millet, in a French
                translation—I found it very absorbing, sharp &amp; hard—with a strongly
                eulogistic preface by W D Howells—a little book pub'd by
                    Harpers—Horace bro't it to me—8½ Horace
                pays his welcome evening visit—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-12-26">Wednesday 26th—10¾ A M</span></p>
            <p class="tei_p">I continue fairly—have had my breakfast, &amp; the fine weather
                continues—two welcome letters from you this morning's mail—I watch with
                interest the meter—Gurd fortunes &amp; struggles—Well for
                now New years—&amp; then 1889—God bless you &amp; yours—</p>
