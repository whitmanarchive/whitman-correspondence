            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write you a word to say that I am perfectly well and hearty</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We arrived here last night about dark, and are going to fall in, in a few minutes to move on towards Warrenton I believe. I hear that Grant has issued an order, that no letters will be allowed to be sent from this army for the next Sixty days. If that is the case Walt you must tell Mother not to feel the least bit worried if she does not hear from me in some time. I send this by Adjt McKee who is going to Washington for a day or two</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I can tell you nothing about the army, more than you already know everyone seems to be in good spirits and hopefull. I sent my trunk from Annapolis to Washingt to our Sutler, who keeps a place in Washington  his name is L. Kipps  cor of F &amp; 9th St  Model House</p>
