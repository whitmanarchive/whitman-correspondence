         <p class="tei_p">I received yours of Dec 17th [lost letter] and as always will be the case was glad to hear from you  I have delayed answering your last a day or two for this reason. I have been very busy and shall write but little this time as I must go once to a place called West Jersey about ten miles from here to see about buying a house and lot but do not think that because I write but little I am tired of writing to you or wish to stop corresponding with you for I know of no one's letters that are looked for and read with more interest than yours, now that Mary has come. She came down on tuesday  she is well though tired when she arrived  she sends her love to you give my respects to all friends and write soon I will write again soon yours ever</p>
