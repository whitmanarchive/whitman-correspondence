            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 17<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> came to hand
                yesterday and I left it over till today that I might answer it at leisure. That is
                grand news about Kennedy's book, that Wilson will really publish it and at once, so it is that the German translation is actually being
                printed at last. I shall be very glad to get the
                Springfield Rep<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">n</span> con<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">g</span> the
                "Whittier, Whitman &amp; Emma Lazarus" criticism—please do not forget to send it when you can spare it. No, I have received
                no German papers of any kind from any body for a long time, where are they? If still
                comeatable send them. [—] We have, thank goodness,
                a change in the weather, it has been blowing from the East for about twenty-four
                hours and now (as a natural consequence) it has begun to snow—and it is coming
                down at a great rate before a driving cold East wind out of a dark gray sky which
                looks as if it was made of solid snow banks. If we have no diasastros change (such as
                a shift of the wind) we shall have good sleighing tomorrow morning. All well and all
                quiet here, annual Ball getting pretty near now, a week from thursday—i.e.
                    1<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span>—soon after that I hope to see you, but we
                have had no word of our patents yet and there may still be some hitch for all I can
                tell—but I hope not</p>
