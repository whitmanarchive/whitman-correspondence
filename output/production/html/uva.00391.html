            <p class="tei_p">Yours <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  last week—Nothing new with me—I still keep well—The lecture is a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fixed fact</span> (to come)—but I shall wait till I get good &amp; ready—I suppose as I am writing this you &amp; 'Sula are now home—I 'most envy you—Very cold here to day, but bright—&amp; I am just going out for a couple of hours</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">25th Christmas afternoon</span>—Went out—also yesterday—but not long or far, as we are having a sharp spell of cold &amp; gusty winds here these days—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Received​ ">Rec'd</span>​  a letter from Herbert Gilchrist this morning—they are at 315 West 19 Street, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N.

            <p class="tei_p">—Write me more fully about your proposed book of next spring—(it is in the gestation of a book—the melting of the fluid metal, before the casting—that it receives that something to make its idiosyncrasy, identity—its "excuse for being" if it is to have any—)</p> 
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have written to Jenny Gilder &amp; sent her a small budget of printed slips &amp;c.
