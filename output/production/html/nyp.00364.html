                    <p class="tei_p">This postcard bears the address, "Pete Doyle, | M street South—bet 4½
                        &amp; M. | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Apr | 16 | N.J.;
                        Carrier | 17 | Apr | 8 (?) AM."</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The correspondence (again chiefly postcards) with Doyle in April and May was
                        sent on Fridays, according to Whitman's habit. At this time Doyle was
                        working out of Baltimore; note Whitman's <a href="loc.01655">April 30,
                            1875</a>, and <a href="loc.01629">June 25, 1875</a> letters to
                        Doyle. This postcard can be positively dated on the basis of Burroughs'
                        visit; see his letter to Dowden on May 4, 1875, quoted by Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston:
                        Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 94.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
