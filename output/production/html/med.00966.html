            <p class="tei_p">Our city is quite well supplied, now-a-days, with the
                article of military characters—both officer and private. Major Gen. Gaines has returned among us; and has issued a sort of
                manifesto, so unique in its character that I cannot help copying it, for the benefit
                of the New Orleanois. Gen. Gaines is speaking of the returned soldiers from Mexico.
                [The order here referred to was published yesterday.—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eds</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What documents does this remind you of—is this in
                the style of Hannibal, Caesar, or Bonaparte?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Cool weather yet continues—that is comparatively
                cool.—People are flocking back to town from their cotes in the country. Every
                one is curious to hear the news from Ireland; and the Irish themselves are half
                crazy with doubt. Large sums of money have been poured
                in to the hands of the "Irish Directory" in this city—of course for the
                purchase of arms and equipments to help the Repealers. It is expected that we shall
                soon hear of some diplomatic passages between the British and our officers.</p>
