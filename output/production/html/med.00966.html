                    the political and cultural forces pushing for an independent Ireland
                    in the 1840s. The Young Ireland movement was an Irish
                    nationalist movement that supported Irish independence. The movement
                    had its origins in the Repeal Association's campaign to dissolve 
                    the 1800 Irish Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland.
                    Young Irelanders seceded from the Repeal Association and formed
                    the Irish Confederation, garnering a strong base in
                    Dublin, and exerting a lasting influence on subsequent separatist endeavors.
                     Young Irelanders attempted an unsuccessful insurrection in 1848 with
                     the aims of Irish independence and democratic reform and 
                    as a response to British Parliament's passage of a "Crime and Outrage Bill"
                    that enacted martial law in Ireland in an attempt to counter Irish nationalism. 
                    The Young Irelanders' rebellion in July 1848, resulted in the arrest of the movement's leaders and the collapse 
                    of the rebellion efforts. Ireland would not become self-governing until 1922. </span></span> [<a href="#r1b">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03259_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03259_n7"><span>Edwin Forrest

                    1849 nativist riot at New York's Astor Opera House that left twenty-five dead. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
