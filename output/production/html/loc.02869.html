            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Shall you never find it in your heart to say a kind word to me again? or a word of some sort? Surely I must 
                have written what displeased you very much that you should turn away from me as the tone of your last letter 
                &amp; the ten months' silence which have followed seem

                to express to me with such emphasis. But if so, tell me of it, tell me how—with perfect candour. I am 
                worthy of that—a willing learner &amp; striver; not afraid of the pain of looking my own faults &amp; 
                shortcomings steadily in the face. Or it may be my words have led you to do me some kind of injustice in 
                thought,—&amp; then I could defend myself. But if it is simply that

                you are preoccupied, too busy—perhaps very eagerly beset by hundreds like myself whose hearts are so 
                drawn out of their breasts by your Poems that they cannot rest without striving, some way or other, to draw 
                near to you personally—then write once more &amp; tell me so &amp; I will learn to be content. But please 
                let it be a letter just like the first three you wrote: &amp; do not fear that I shall take it

                to mean anything it doesn't mean. I shall never do that again, though it was natural enough at first, with the 
                deep unquestioning belief I had that I did but answer a call; that I not only might, but ought, on pain of being 
                untrue to the greatest, sweetest instincts &amp; aspirations of my own soul, to answer it with all my heart &amp; 
                strength &amp; life. I say to myself, I say to you as I did in my first letters This voice that has come to me 
                from over the Atlantic is the one

                divine voice that has penetrated to my soul: is the utterance of a nature that sends out life giving warmth &amp; 
                light to my inward self as actually as the Sun does to my body, &amp; draws me to it and shapes &amp; shall shape 
                my course just as the Sun shapes the Earth's. "Interlocked in a vast similitude"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a>
                indeed are these inner &amp; outer truths of our lives. It may be that this shaping of my life course

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
