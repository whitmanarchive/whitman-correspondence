                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I felt bad enough to hear of the death of Bill Barnes—&amp; in such a sudden, cruel way—poor young man—he has had a reckless unsatisfactory life—many deficiencies &amp; very shiftless—all of which I understood perfectly well—but I had an affection for him after all—Have I not heard that he had a wife &amp; child? which, (if so,) he has left—but was parted from quite a while ago—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete, so your shirts came all safe, &amp; they fit you, do they?—good—The blue shirt (did I write?) is to wear <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">over</span>, loose—it is made large for that purpose—I like the looks of them, the blue shirt collar turned down low with a nice black 
                silk neck handkerchief, tied loose—over a clean white shirt without necktie—I think they are very becoming to young working-men—I sent 3 Graphics to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—when you hear, tell me if they came safe.—I send you some papers to-day—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—There is nothing new with me, or my condition—My principal malady is about the same, 
                (no worse)—but I <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01626.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01626.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01626.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>have had for three or four days a wretched cold in the head, 
                sore throat, most lost my voice for two days—every thing bad enough—am better rather to-day, begin to speak so I can be understood—shall be all right soon—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—As I write, it is now between 11 and 12 a.m. Friday—it is very mild, sunshiny forenoon—I am sitting here in the parlor,—looks south, looks down a pleasant street, West street, 
                full view, makes quite a nice view for me to sit &amp; look out—the letter carrier 
                comes around in about an hour from now, &amp; takes my letters to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Post Office​ ">P.O.</span>​ —I have become sort of acquainted with most of the carriers, ferry men, 
                car conductors &amp; drivers, &amp;c. &amp;c.—they are very good indeed—help me on &amp; off the cars, here &amp; in Philadelphia—they are nearly all young fellows—it all <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">help​ </span><span class="tei_corr">helps​
        
      </span></span> along—Well Pete, dear loving boy, I will bid you good bye for this week.
