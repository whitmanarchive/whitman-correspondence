            <p class="tei_p">I felt bad enough to hear of the death of Bill Barnes<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—&amp; in such a sudden, cruel way—poor young man—he has had a reckless unsatisfactory life—many deficiencies &amp; very shiftless—all of which I understood perfectly well—but I had an affection for him after all—Have I not heard that he had a wife &amp; child? which, (if so,) he has left—but was parted from quite a while ago—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete, so your shirts came all safe, &amp; they fit you, do they?—good—The blue shirt (did I write?) is to wear <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">over</span>, loose—it is made large for that purpose—I like the looks of them, the blue shirt collar turned down low with a nice black 
                silk neck handkerchief, tied loose—over a clean white shirt without necktie—I think they are very becoming to young working-men—I sent 3 Graphics to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—when you hear, tell me if they came safe.—I send you some papers to-day—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—There is nothing new with me, or my condition—My principal malady is about the same,

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
