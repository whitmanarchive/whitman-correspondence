                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Whitman published the book himself—in an arrangement with the Philadephia
                    publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen

                    Camden physician who attended Whitman, visiting him nearly every day, during the
                    poet's illness of 1888–89. Walsh was the brother of William S. Walsh, an
                    American author and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Monthly
                        Magazine</span>. Whitman had a favorable opinion of Walsh because he visited
                    often, watched his patient carefully, but did not give medicine. See Whitman's
                    letter to Bucke of <a href="loc.07560">December 18, 1888</a>. Bucke had
                    arranged to have Walsh accompany Dr. Osler to see Whitman, since Bucke believed
                    it would be useful to have a younger doctor examine the poet. See Horace

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
                    Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
                    volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>
                    (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"

                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
