            <p class="tei_p">Sent you quite a letter &amp; budget of papers last evn'g—hope you rec'd them
                right—hope the big books have surely reach'd you all right by this
                time—I ought to be better than I am—but am feeling bad &amp; sore &amp;
                tired out—had a decided bowel movement this forenoon—appetite pretty
                good (I have just eaten some chocolate ice cream)—have not eaten any solid
                food for ten days—drink cold milk by preference—have much
                thirst—Dr Walsh comes every day, seems to watch carefully
                but gives no medicine—I like him &amp; his ways—Have been sitting up
                here trying the morning newspaper—the utter fiasco of poor Lesseps—the 81st birthday of Whittier—&amp;c—have now been sitting up from three to four hours—have
                written to Kennedy—Yours of 16th rec'd &amp; welcom'd—two sweet nice letters from
                15 y'r girls—so good, so tasty—I must now get to bed to rest—</p>
