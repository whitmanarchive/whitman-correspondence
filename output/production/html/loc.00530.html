            <p class="tei_p">Yours of Nov: 28 rec'd. My satisfaction with your proposed German trans[lation] increases the more you unfold it, and I think of it. What you say against the two texts is sound, &amp; I am content (retracting former suggestion) that it should be in the usual form, in German only. Want it by all means to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete</span>. In the whole matter I freely trust to your intuitions and 'cuteness as to meanings, my dear friend—you have so long been a reader and lover of the book—&amp; I fully empower you to go on &amp; go your own way. I like of course what you say of getting the carefullest, technical, grammatical (and ? idiomatic) German assistance and collaboration as you go along.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have received a good letter from Mr Lee about the Russian translation, &amp; have written him in answer.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I keep well for me, &amp; shall remain here for the winter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">recd</span>​  a note from me weeks since acknowledging the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Encheiredion</span>. My letter to Mr Lee was also as a preface to the Russian translation. Should that be fulfilled I will prepare &amp; send you something of the same sort for the German Volume—I think so much of the internationality element (sentiment) which I have intended as one of the leading fibres of my book—</p>
