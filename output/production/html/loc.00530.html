Want it by all means to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete</span>. In the whole matter I freely trust to your intuitions and 'cuteness as to meanings, my dear friend—you have so long been a reader and lover of the book—&amp; I fully empower you to go on &amp; go your own way. I like of course what you say of getting the carefullest, technical, grammatical (and ? idiomatic) German assistance and collaboration as you go along.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have received a good letter from Mr Lee<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> about the Russian translation, &amp; have written him in answer.</p>

Should that be fulfilled I will prepare &amp; send you something of the same sort for the German Volume—I think so much of the internationality element (sentiment) which I have intended as one of the leading fibres of my book—</p>

                    translation of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> "as soon as I could find a
                    proper German collaborateur" (Frenz, 41). In his lost letter written on November
                    9, Whitman approved the translation and proposed a double text. On <a href="loc.05094">November 28</a> Rolleston confessed that the
                    "collaborateur" was too "pedantic," and that he had reservations as to a double
                    text (Frenz, 44–46). On <a href="loc.05097">January 7</a>, in reply
                    to this letter, Rolleston stated his "principle of rigid literality" (Frenz,
                    54). The Rolleston translation was completed years later with the assistance of
                    Karl Knortz. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00530_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00530_n4"><span>See the letter from
