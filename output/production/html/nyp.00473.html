            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came all right, &amp; glad to hear from you, as always. There is nothing
                very new with me—I keep on about the same in most every respect—To-day,
                (Tuesday) as I write it is warm &amp; bright, &amp; I am going out to enjoy
                it—pretty much the same old round—over the ferry &amp; up Market street,

                that my two books, prose and the poems, are out, I hardly know what to strike
                for—what to look forward to, as I used to—The Vols. are selling middling
                    well—"Specimen Days" has been republished in
                    Scotland<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> &amp; L. of G. is being translated in

                have been out &amp; only got back late—This will be a dry letter—but you
                must take the will for the deed—I send you a package of papers &amp;c. once in
                a while, which I suppose you get—I came over to-night through the thick ice,
                filling the river—one big cake, half an acre, or more, hard &amp; thick, I
                thought would conquer us, but it didnt, we <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="crunched​ ">crunch'd</span>​ </span> our way

            <p class="tei_p">I have just been looking for your last letter to see if there is any special thing I
                ought to answer—but I cant find the letter—Never mind, Harry,
                dear—we'll make it all right when we meet—I have just written to your
                mother—Well my space is out, &amp; there goes the clock striking 11—Good
                night, dear son—&amp; here's a buss for you—</p>
