            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have got word from you once or twice—&amp; glad
                to hear that you keep well &amp; in good spirits—that's more than half the
                battle—&amp; I'm sure its the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">best half</span> too—I got
                a letter from Dr B[ucke] to-day—he mentions you in it, &amp; speaks very
                friendlily indeed of you—I also rec'd a letter from your mother to-day, which
                I will enclose, as every thing from home is welcome, (even if she has written
                already to you, as is very likely)—I have written to your mother this
                evening—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I jog along very much in the old way—am pretty well, so far this
                winter—(they say I am fatter &amp; more red-faced than ever)—I spent my
                Christmas over in Germantown at Mr and Mrs Williams's,
                new friends, very nice, &amp; a big family of children—was there four
                days—had a jolly time—a sleigh ride, or two—fine traveling, but
                too cold to enjoy it—Ruth and Burt were up here to
                see me last week—Ruth is going to make a fine looking woman, &amp; good-sized,
                like her mother (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Shape first, face afterward</span>, was the saying
                of a old sport I used to know)—I met Ed Stafford (John's son) yesterday at the ferry—he asked about
                you—the boys are all curious to know about you—all wish you luck,
                sincerely—Well good bye for the present, my darling boy—Keep a good
                heart—we will be together yet &amp; have good times yet—(I shall break
                up from here in the Spring &amp; leave Camden—I don't know where)—</p>
