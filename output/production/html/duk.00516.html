                    this letter March 3. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date and assigned
                    the year 1868 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). March 3 fell on Tuesday
                    in 1868, which matches Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's date "tuesday noon." The year
                    1868 is consistent both with a recent visit to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman by
                    Ellen M. O'Connor and daughter and with Louisa's detailed report on the family
                    of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in St. Louis, Missouri. She relied on a
                    February 24, 1868 letter from Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman for that report.
                    Because the letter is consistent with Louisa's usual practice of reporting to
                    Walt on Jeff's family and on her recent visitors, the O'Connors, this letter
                    dates to March 3, 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r10">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    recommended that Ellen and her daughter make a visit to his mother (see his <a href="nyp.00279">February 24, 1868</a> letter to Nelly). For a time Walt
                    Whitman lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles
                    Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the
                    Washington years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of
                    the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
                    relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In early 1868, Mattie and her daughters

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa

                    Vermont. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive
                    letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman often spoke
                    disparagingly of Heyde in her letters to Walt: "i had a letter or package from
                    charley hay three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool wrote on them" (see her

                    1869). Walt Whitman assisted with the move by "hiring a stout young laboring
