            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very special with me—bad enough yet and imprison'd in the room and
                chair, but easier and freer of the intestinal and bladder troubles and fearful
                weakness of ten weeks ago—At present I am sitting by the oak fire in my big
                chair, well protected—as it is bitter cold the last two days and now
                here—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The news from O'Connor is bad, and worse—he is confined to
                the house and seems to be failing. . . . Most probably I shall continue ab't the
                stage I am at present—maybe some time, but the future will eventuate itself,
                and it will of course be all right. I continue almost totally disabled from getting
                around, can hardly get across the room—have a good stout nurse, Ed Wilkins f'm Canada—no serious pain in particular—good heart
                yet—eat and sleep fairly—so you see it is not so bad as might
                be—(and perhaps will be yet)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a piece you might like to see—Dr
                    B[ucke] is expected here in a week or ten days—I
                suppose you hear f'm Horace Traubel and that keeps you posted.
                H. T. has been and is invaluable to me—my books are all printed etc. (I have a
                big book, complete poems and prose for you)—</p>
