            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came yesterday—also the liquorice powder—I have no doubt the

                it—I am as well as usual with me—up, and at my window, as now—get
                out with the horse &amp; wagon every afternoon but shall not to-day—nothing
                new in my affairs—get along quite comfortably—have some visitors—a
                canny Scotchman, a literary man, but a good jovial fellow, elderly with a humorous
                turn, &amp; much reminiscence, has been in this forenoon to see me—I like to
                have him—It is a raw, dark, rainy day—I wish I could have you here to
                eat a bite of dinner with me, &amp; chat for the afternoon—Several of my
                friends have had your little book,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> lent them by
                me—Scovel (with his lawyer's head)<a href="#n1049" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1049">4</a> said to me after reading it, "there can be

                    actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S.
                    Treasury during Chester Arthur's administration. In the 1870s, Whitman
                    frequently went to Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast (Whitman's Commonplace
