            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came yesterday—also the liquorice powder—I have no doubt the
                powder will be good for me. I have already begun
                it—I am as well as usual with me—up, and at my window, as now—get
                out with the horse &amp; wagon every afternoon but shall not to-day—nothing
                new in my affairs—get along quite comfortably—have some visitors—a
                canny Scotchman, a literary man, but a good jovial fellow, elderly with a humorous
                turn, &amp; much reminiscence, has been in this forenoon to see me—I like to
                have him—It is a raw, dark, rainy day—I wish I could have you here to
                eat a bite of dinner with me, &amp; chat for the afternoon—Several of my
                friends have had your little book, lent them by
                me—Scovel (with his lawyer's head) said to me after reading it, "there can be
                no doubt of it"—i e that B[acon] is the true author—</p>
