                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    1880, Bucke traveled with Whitman from the poet's home in Camden to Bucke's
                    residence near London, Ontario, Canada. After spending the summer on the grounds
                    of the Asylum for the Insane, the two went on an extended trip that included
                    journeying by railroad to Toronto and taking a steamship on Lake Ontario before
                    going to Chicoutimi, Quebec, on the Saguenay River. On the return journey, Bucke
                    traveled with Whitman as far as Niagara, at which point the poet retuned to New
                    Jersey on his own. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08139_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08139_n2"><span>Bucke experienced a series
                    of accidents and bouts with illness in the winter of 1890 and spring of 1891. He
                    dislocated his shoulder as the result of a fall in December 1890. See Bucke's
                    letter of December 25, 1890, to Whitman's biographer and literary executor
                    Horace Traubel, which is reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.175.html">Saturday, December 27, 1890</a>. In his <a href="loc.08134">April 13,
                        1891</a>, letter to Whitman, Bucke writes that his foot, which had been
                    sore for a couple of weeks, had become inflamed. He goes on to note that he was
                    "confined" in his room while his foot was "mending," and he also explains that
                    the "grip" he had suffered in late January seemed to have lingering symptoms
                    that he continued to experience. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08072_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08072_n2"><span>As Bucke's letters in May
                    and June 1891 both to Whitman and Horace Traubel make clear, he was going abroad
                    to establish a foreign market for his gas and fluid meter, a subject to which he
                    referred constantly in his communications but which the poet studiously
                    ignored. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
