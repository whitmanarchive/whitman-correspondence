                    Fisher Browne (1843–1913), the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Every-Day
                        Life of Abraham Lincoln</span> (1886). Browne, editor of the literary monthly
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Dial</span>, was familiar with Whitman's work, having
                    written <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1881/anc.00087.html">a review</a> of the 1881-82 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>. In his biography of Lincoln, Browne reprinted Whitman's poem "O
                    Captain ! My Captain!" under the title "Walt Whitman's Poem on President
                    Lincoln's Death." It is possible that Browne sent Whitman a copy of the
                    biography, to which Whitman is here responding. </span></span></p></div>
