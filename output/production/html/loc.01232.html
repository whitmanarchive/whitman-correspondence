            </span>
                       
            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks for your two enclosures of printed extracts &amp;c. I wrote to Mr. Buchanan 
                about his plan of forming a society for the circulation of your works, but he has not given me very definite 
                information of what is intended;            
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01232.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01232.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01232.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                meanwhile for the time I have been absorbed by the news of the death of one of my brothers in India. This 
                brings with it the additional pang to me that it will probably prevent my intended journey to the States 
                this Summer. I had made all arrangements, and was carried forward on the hope of seeing you, and now I am 
                greatly disappointed.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I must ask instead that you will send me your two volumes when ready—two 
                copies of each—I am anxious to see them. Please forward them as soon as you can to me at 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">45 Brunswick Square, Brighton</span>. I have got a P.O.O for £4 
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I enclose; I was trusting 
                to what I think Robert Buchanan said that £1 was the price per vol.,

                but I do not feel sure this is right as $5 would be more than that. However you will let me know if there is 
                any excess due to you &amp; I will forward the sum. It is difficult for us in England to know what is the truth 
                among all the conflicting reports. I hope that the latest namely that you are not suffering from any immediate want 
                is the right one, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  I feel that you must often be under
                some pressure of difficulty. Of one thing 
                
                I am sure—from internal evidence so to speak—namely that your books have never been a source 
                of profit to you—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​  they may have been to others</p>
