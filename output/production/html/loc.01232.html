            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks for your two enclosures of printed extracts &amp;c. I wrote to Mr. Buchanan<a href="#n0117" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0117">1</a> 
                about his plan of forming a society for the circulation of your works, but he has not given me very definite 
                information of what is intended;

                meanwhile for the time I have been absorbed by the news of the death of one of my brothers in India. This 
                brings with it the additional pang to me that it will probably prevent my intended journey to the States 
                this Summer. I had made all arrangements, and was carried forward on the hope of seeing you, and now I am 
                greatly disappointed.</p>

                but I do not feel sure this is right as $5 would be more than that. However you will let me know if there is 
                any excess due to you &amp; I will forward the sum. It is difficult for us in England to know what is the truth 
                among all the conflicting reports. I hope that the latest namely that you are not suffering from any immediate want

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    critic, had lauded Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Broadway Annual</span> in
                    1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
                    to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
                    See Harold Blodgett, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman in England</span> (1934),
                    79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>
                    (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
                    attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip
                    W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_91.html">Buchanan, Robert (1841–1901)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:

                    celebration of the U.S. in 1876, Whitman reissued the fifth edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in the repackaged form of a "Centennial Edition" and
                    "Author's Edition," with most copies personally signed by the poet. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> was published as a companion volume to the
                    book. Notable for its experimentations in form, typography, and printing
                    convention, Whitman's two-volume set marks an important departure from previous
