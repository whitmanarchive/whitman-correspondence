                    homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic poetry
                    and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it was then
                    known. See Andrew C. Higgins, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    inspired by Whitman. In his <a href="loc.07357">August 20–22,
                        1890</a>, letter, Bucke remarked: "The whole article is 'flat, stale and
                    unprofitable'—a saw dust chewing business—dealing with the hull, the
                    shell, the superfices, never for one line, one flash of insight penetrating to
                    the heart of the business." On <a href="loc.07827">August 24, 1890</a>,
                    Whitman observed: "you are a little more severe on Symonds than I sh'd
