                    was the sister of Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in

                    farmers at White Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited
                    them on several occasions. For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G.

                    Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
                    pieces of criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "A Woman's
                    Estimate of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M.

                    Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
                    love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
                    visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
                    a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman
