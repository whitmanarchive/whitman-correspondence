                    for a newspaper or in a printing plant (see the letter from Whitman to Edward
                    Carpenter of <a href="med.00630">September 1, 1878</a>). Probably Whitman
                    was seeking a position for Harry when he wrote on October 9 to William Taylor,

                    November 13 Whitman noted that Harry was at "Atco," but after his visit on
