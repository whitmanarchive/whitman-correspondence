                    <p class="tei_p">Although the executors dated this postcard 1878, 1876 seems more plausible;
                        note the similar phraseology in Whitman's <a href="loc.01672">December
                            13, 1876</a> letter to Doyle and the reference to the weather in
                        Whitman's <a href="mhs.00009">December 20, 1876</a> letter to
                        Mannahatta and Jessie Whitman. In 1877 the weather late in December,
                        according to his Commonplace Book, was perfect, and Walt Whitman visited the
                        Gilchrists almost daily. In 1878 there is no indication in Whitman's
                        Commonplace Book (kept by the poet as a diary, a memorandum, and account
                        book, this bound manuscript notebook dates from March 1876 to 30 May 1889)
                        that Whitman wrote to Doyle, or that the weather kept Whitman indoors (note
                        Whitman's <a href="uva.00391">December 23–25, 1878</a> letter to
                        John Burroughs, in which Whitman wrote of going out despite "a sharp spell
                        of cold &amp; gusty winds here these days"). Probably Doyle had answered
