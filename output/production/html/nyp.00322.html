      <p class="tei_p">I am having quite a good spell to-day, (if it only lasts)—I wish you, 
        in conjunction with Peter Doyle, would go over to my room at Dr. White's, 
        &amp; unlock the big trunk, (the one that is strapped) and take out
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My gray suit</span>, coat, vest, &amp; I think there are two pairs of pants, both alike.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">My <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">black overcoat</span>, quite heavy—it is the one in the trunk—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Black felt hat, (there are two black hats, this is the lightest, 
        most flexible one—not the big fellow.)
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">The pair of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">old buckskin gloves</span>, with sheepskin cuffs and do them up in a bundle—I think you can get three or four large sheets of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very strong brown paper</span> for wrapper, 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tied securely</span> with very strong cord—direct plainly to me, 431 Stevens st. cor. 
        West, here—put duplicate directions on—&amp; send by Adams express—I write to-day 
        to Peter Doyle, same request as this, and asking him to meet you at Milburn's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> bet 3½ and 4, this afternoon—if not to-day, to-morrow, (or next day, or next still) 
        will do just as well, as I am in no particular hurry. Pete put the things in the trunk for me, 
        &amp; will know about them. Then lock &amp; strap the trunk again, &amp; return key to me. 
        There are two locks, both of which this key unlocks.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  your good letter yesterday. I will write promptly if there is any marked change 
        in my condition. I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  a letter from Walter Godey, Saturday, &amp; wrote to him yesterday.
