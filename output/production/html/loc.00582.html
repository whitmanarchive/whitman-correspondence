                    Thayer and Eldridge publicly declared bankruptcy. As William Wilde Thayer later
                    remembered in his unpublished autobiography, his publishing firm was "caught
                    with all sails spread, without warning of the storm. Merchants at once began to
                    retrench and reduce liabilities. Capital hid itself. Banks were distrustful. No
                    one knew how the war would end. Books being a luxury, there was no demand. All
                    book firms were 'shaky.' . . . Anti-slavery people were interested in keeping
                    [Thayer and Eldridge] up, but they were forced to call in their funds and most
                    reluctantly let us go down"" (see William Wilde Thayer, "Autobiography of
                    William Wilde Thayer," 22, unpublished manuscript, Feinberg Collection). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00582_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00582_n3"><span>Whitman was asked to return
