                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I got your letter of the 29th, and in the afternoon of the same day (March 30) the
                package of books came. It was very kind in you to send
                them. As Dr. Channing's family are ardent friends of you
                and your book, and have no recent issues, I turned over to them one copy of the
                poems and the copy of "Specimen Days"—you know I have both myself ("Specimen
                Days," I regret to say, I have never found time to read, but shall, from the copy you
                sent me, when I return to Washington, 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03281.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                as I shall have more leisure this spring and
                summer than I had in the dreadful months of labor when the book came.) The other
                copy of the poems, I shall reserve for some one who shall prove to be worthy: and I
                hope this disposition of your kind gift will please you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Channing family are staunch adherents, and the girls (Mary and Grace—Mary
                was recently married and is living in Cambridge—) both gave their cousin, Col.
                    Higginson, (whom I have gone for so savagely in the
                Introductory) a round talking-to on your account, apropos of his article in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The
                Woman's Journal</span>. But Higginson is incorrigible.

                I imagine, however, that the
                rhinosceros spear I have planted and turned by steam in his hide (in the
                Introductory) will startle his supercilious composure, especially what I say about
                his Port Royal experience, and I guess he will be mad as a wet hen. All right:
                people that live in porcelain towers or crystal palaces, shouldn't throw stones at
                the "lower <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">h</span>orders," such as we are,—we whose armorial legend is "'eave 'arf
                a brick at 'im!"</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was very kind to send Karl Elze's book, which I have read
                (you know I am a very rapid reader) and will return 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03281.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                to you by express. I knew him
                already by his life of Byron, which I own, and the best thing
                in which is his perfectly exterminating analysis of Mrs Stowe's (or rather Lady Byron's) ridiculous slander. Otherwise in this Byron book, as in
                the one on Shakespeare, he is a perfect Bismarck phillistine,
                with a head of wood just larded with brains. The lack of political freedom, inducing
                proclivity to aristocratic ideas, and utter lack of sympathy with democratic or
                republican thought, makes all the Germans, even the great ones, (and Elze is not
                great), perfectly worthless whenever they approach topics connected with 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03281.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                the
                questions of liberty and humanity; and Shakespeare cannot be successfully approached
                in criticism except in connection with the mighty human movement which made the life
                of his age—"the world-bettering age," as one of the great Elizabethan men
                calls it. Hence this supper of sawdust, such as <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Carl​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Karl​
        
      </span></span> Elze and others like him, sets for us. A dull fellow, moreover, which
                only partly accounts for his slurring notice of Hugo's magnificent book on
                Shakespeare—Bismarckism being accountable for the rest of it. However, what
                paralyzes all Shakespearean criticism, Elze's, as well as the rest, is the
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03281.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                obstinate
                consideration of the work with that Stratford chucklehead and his chucklehead
                biography. If we had no notion whatever of the author, we should fare better in
                understanding the work than we do with William Shakespeare on our brains like an
                incubus. To know a man is to know his book. To be dead sure in advance that Barnum
                wrote <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Hamlet</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Tempest</span>, is to be dead sure of knowing little or nothing of
                those works forever.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have heard nothing yet about the Heywood trial. You and
                    McKay
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">did perfectly right</span> in keeping aloof and not contributing

                to
                the defence. Your connection could not help him and might hurt you. "Against
                stupidity the gods themselves are powerless," says Euripides, and Heywood is
                certainly a champion jackass. I am sorry for him, but his bed is his own making, and
                he should have known what Comstock could do to him if he advertised war on the
                ovaries. I only hope we shall escape the consequences of his folly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose the correction has been made, but I noticed in Bucke's
                Latin motto the error of the diphthong œ (in the fourth line) in the word
                præclarius. It should be æ (AE), not œ. Munro spells it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">praeclarius</span>, not
                using 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.008.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03281.008.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.008.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                the diphthong character at all, which is sensible.—It is a glorious
                    epigraph.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just been down to the Post Office, and got your letter of yesterday, but not the revise, which will not come until tomorrow
                morning. I am rejoiced at what you say of my contribution, but feel <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">dreadfully</span> at the prospect your letter opens, of my
                paragraphing being changed. I could bear with equanimity anything but
                that—especially the breaking up of my running account of the great books into
                paragraphs. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">That</span> I never can like. The effect will be
                horrible. Besides, you told me I was to have my way.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will write you again after 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.009.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03281.009.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03281.009.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                and flows) and be able to journey home. At present, she is too ill and

                over it before I leave, if I get it tomorrow morning. Thanks to Protestantism,
                Sunday knocks post office usages endways. The post office can only be open for an
                hour on God's day, so that I get your letter, but not the proof, there not being time
                for the officials to overhaul postal matter of the second or third or fourth class
