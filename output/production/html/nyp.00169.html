         <p class="tei_p">I once more after a long delay will endeavor to converse with you with the aid of pens &amp; paper. I received a answer to my first letter stating that you wer at home sick. I was very very sorry to hear of it indeed, for it appears to be very hard for you to be sick, after being
amongst it so much in the Hospitals &amp; doing so much to seas [cease ?] it among the suffering &amp; sick Soldiers, but if it is the will of God I suppose it is for the best. I hope by the time this reaches you that you will be in the enjoyment of good health. I have got my discharge from the Hospitals about 3 weeks ago &amp; am now employed in the Provost Marshall office at the corner of 18th &amp; I St at the enrolling office  I like the place very well but I dont know how long I will stay here. The salery is $ 3.00 per day &amp; the work is very easy. We are allmost ready for the draft to come off I guess that by tomorrow Morning we will have all the cards wrote. there is over 2000 men to come out of the district &amp; that is going to fetch some of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">old rats out of their holes</span>.

One of the detectives arrested a deserter belonging to the 14th Broklin Regiment that deserted at the first Battle of Bulls Run  he has bin working for Adams &amp; Co.
