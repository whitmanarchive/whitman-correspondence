                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1855–1928) was a lawyer's clerk and a member of the "Bolton College" of
                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February
