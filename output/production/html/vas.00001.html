                Horace too were here looking for you &amp; were disappointed. The 9th 
                Vol of the big "American Literature" from Stedman came this morning—I 
                see you appear in it with a good portrait &amp; ten pages of text, well selected—all 
                very good &amp; generous I say—and deserved—O'Connor is 
                also in the book—</p>

                day, portending more rain—</p>
