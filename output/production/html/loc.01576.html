            <p class="tei_p">In my note of January 17 last, sending "Whispers of Heavenly Death," I included a request
                for thirty copies of the magazine, containing the piece, whenever printed. If
                agreeable therefore, please request the New York house to send by express, at my
                expense, thirty copies of the "Broadway" containing the piece, to my address,
                Attorney Gen's office, here.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I propose, before long, to submit to you another piece, for the magazine, if
                    approved.
            </p>
