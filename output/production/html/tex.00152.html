            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I thought I would write a day before the usual time, as I did not send any letter last Saturday. For the last two days I have felt a good deal better—My head is much better, &amp; I feel more like myself every way. I sent Han a short letter last Friday, &amp; sent the piece from the "Galaxy"—I thought it would please her.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I went to the Hospital yesterday afternoon—took a lot of tobacco, &amp;c. I wrote several letters—there are quite a good many, some with sickness, some with old wounds—two or three in the last stages of consumption, &amp;c. I go every Sunday, &amp; sometimes Wednesday also—There are many of the patients, very young men, country boys—several from the Southern states, whose parents &amp; homes &amp; families are gone or broke up—&amp; they have enlisted in the regular army—then they get down with fever or something, &amp; are sent to Hospital—I find most of them can't read or write—there are many of these homeless Southern young men now enlisted in the regulars—they have no other resource—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have quite a procession here to-day to "welcome Congress"—two-thirds of it consists of darkies—they look very well too—the streets are jammed with darkies—I tell you when they do turn out here they are thicker than crows in a cornfield—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The O'Connors have got to move—but can't get a house suitable—Every thing in the office same as usual—We are having beautiful bright, coolish weather—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thursday last, Thanksgiving day, four of us went out in Maryland 15 miles, to see the Great Falls, on the Potomac. We carried a basket of grub, built a fire &amp; made tea, &amp;c—had a first rate, quiet time—the Falls were a fine sight—almost as impressive as Niagara—I much enjoyed the ride &amp; every thing, &amp; it did me good—I felt well, all day, &amp; have felt quite well ever since. Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; to all.</p>
