                Our papers have contained most flattering accounts of interview between

                think even more of him, for the good taste in thinking so much

                a body feel a great deal better, to get out doors helps lots of the bad and blue feelings.</p>

                    (1832–1904) wrote from Washington, D. C. requesting permission to visit
                    Whitman. (The Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Traveller</span> on October 5, 1889,
                    however reprinted a purported letter from Arnold to Whitman dated September 12,
                    written from New York, in a flamboyant style not found in the actual letter.)
                    For an account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
                        Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>: "My main objection to him, if objection
                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering." Arnold
                    published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and
                        Lands</span> (1891), in which he averred that the two read from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis, knitting, a
                    handsome young man (Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at least two
                    additional accounts of Arnold's visit with Whitman; "Arnold and Whitman" was
                    published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Times</span> (Philadelphia, PA) on
                        <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00519.html">September 15, 1889</a>, and a different article, also titled "Arnold and
                    Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Daily Picayune</span>
                    (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. Arnold was best known for his long narrative
                    poem, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> (1879), which tells the life
                    story and philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely responsible for

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
