                (but I mustn't hurrah before clearing the woods)—something like a (limited but decided) bowel discharge last evn'g—&amp; another slight

                Eng. wherein I read the piece by W<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">m</span> Sharp on Amer National

                            <p class="tei_p">"The Brazen Andriod" is the curious title of a story by the late William D. O'Connor,
                             which has been found among his papers since his death. The first part appears in the April <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic</span>.
                            It gives a vivid picture of mediæval London, and its chief characters are the King, Henry III, Simon de Montfort, and Roger
                            Bacon—the artificer of the prophetic android. Mr. O'Connor's previous stories, "The Carpenter," and "The Ghost,"
                            made some stir in the literary world at the time they were published: and this posthumous work stands out amid the mass of 
                            every-day short stories with startling distinctness.

                (one of the boys) was here last evn'g—the S's
                are there yet ab't same—the elder George keeps up but I am afraid is substantially dismantled 
                (I don't know—may be better than I think for)—Poor Harry has moved home 
                to his parents with his wife &amp; two young ones—I take pills, the Fred. water &amp; use the catheter—</p>

                Dr L has been—thinks the affair is going on satisfactory—&amp; I guess it is—bowel action not 
                copious but decided every day the last three days—McKay just orders 
                six sets big books in sheets—the "Truth" people have paid me ($26) for two 
                moderate contributions—I don't think Ing's Shakspere piece in N Y. 
                has been reported or printed—(kept back I guess for fuller corrections)—dark glum weather to-day—lots of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">grip</span> around 
                &amp; I have mine plain 
                &amp; settled—have just sent Warry up for more Fred: bottles (take a little in hot water every mn'g)—have just 
                written to Dr Johnston—have just sent back some proofs 
                (to page 36)—Mrs: O'C is still in office at Wash'n—Chief Kimball has 
                sent the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Life-Service Reports</span> to H T. who thinks of excerpting W D O'C's special parts, 
                as I suppose you know. It is 2 P M as I close &amp; all goes fairly
