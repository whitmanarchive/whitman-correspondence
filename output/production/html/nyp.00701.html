            <p class="tei_p">A fine sunny day here &amp; I am feeling fairly—have just
                had a good stout currying &amp; kneading &amp; it fits my case—am going out
                for half an hour in the wheel chair, the sun is so inviting—rec'd your postal
                card—I enclose Dr B[ucke]'s letter, just come—I too think at least a volume ought to be &amp;
                probably might be well collated &amp; printed of dear W's
                MS—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evn'g</span>—Am sitting here alone by oak fire—went
                out in the wheel chair &amp; enjoy'd it—sales of my books sparse but give me a
                little to do, &amp; a sufficient sustenance, little but will do—just had a
                letter f'm Wiesbaden ab't the German L of G.—very
                eulogistic &amp;c—one of the best criticisms is f'rm France—by a
                Parisian, Gabriel Sarrazin, if ever printed translated I will
                send to you—</p>
