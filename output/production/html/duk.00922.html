            <p class="tei_p">Am sitting here by the fire alone early afternoon &amp; will write you a few lines—have
                had my light dinner—(stew'd chicken &amp; a cup of tea &amp; enjoy'd with sufficient
                zest)—Feelings in general not much different—of good substantial spirits, the fund
                still holds out—but quite a perceptible, steadily, almost rapidly increasing
                weakness of limb, strength, eyesight &amp;c.—In fact a, more or less slow, loosening &amp;
                deadening of the physical machine—After a dark storm, (with snow,) nearly a week,
                the sun is out this afternoon &amp; there is a half-thaw—My friend Pearsall Smith (who
                is very kind all along,) was here yesterday &amp; bro't a great bundle of London
                literary weeklies &amp;c. wh' I have been looking over—I like the advertisement pages
                ab't as well as any—I suppose Ernest Rhys is there with you—I sent him three
                letters yesterday enveloped to your care. I rec'd your letter—Wilson then is the
                pub[lisher] y'r book—If you think well of it, express the whole MS. first, to me
                here, that I may look over &amp; authenticate—Put it in stout pasteboards, tie well, &amp;
                direct fully &amp; carefully, &amp; it will easily travel &amp; the expense will not be
                great—</p>
