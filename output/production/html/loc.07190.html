                    "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
                    as correspondent of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York World</span> from 1860 to 1862.
                    In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
                    until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
                    next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
                    and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poets of America</span>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,

                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).
