                    November 25, 1865. The date, "November 25," is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
                    hand, and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller
                    cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). Bucke's year 1865 is
                    confirmed because the letter describes an alleged murder in Brooklyn City Park,
                    which matches a late-November 1865 murder reported in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, and refers to two November 1865 reviews of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>. </span></span> [<a href="#r14">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00466_n1 note" id="duk.00466_n1"><span>The reported murder occurred
                    in the City Park, which borders the U.S. Navy Yard and was four blocks from
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's home on Portland Avenue near Myrtle. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>'s sensationalistic coverage began on
                    Thursday, November 23, the day after the crime. The victim, later identified as
                    Jose Garcia Otero, was a theater manager, and his body was found with over
                    $200 in cash and gold—reportedly he carried almost $10,000 when he
                    left the Barcelona House, a boarding establishment. Two suspects were
                    identified, Theodore Martinez Pellecer and Jose Gonzales, both Spanish nationals
                    from Cuba; the weapons used to kill Otero were two razors and a dagger. The
                    newspaper covered the case avidly and editorialized on city parks as havens for
                    crime. See "Brutal Murder," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>,

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    had returned to Brooklyn on October 17, after an extended visit to her daughter
                    Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908) in Burlington, Vermont (see Walt
                    Whitman's <a href="nyp.00201">October 20, 1865</a> letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor). Hannah married Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a French-born
                    landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his often
                    offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. According to Thomas Jefferson
                    Whitman's <a href="loc.00440">July 16, 1865</a> letter, Louisa decided to
                    visit Hannah in late 1865 after a quarrel about "some women that Heyde had in

                    "Whitman has done noble service in the war, but he is not a poet, for poetry
                    needs music and imagination, not only the strong feeling and appreciation of
                    nature which Whitman has. His fervent patriotism has produced only commonplace
                    work, despite 'occasional sonorous lines and frequent thrilling passages.' He
                    sins in assuming himself to be the most original and authoritative critic of

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
                    pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the

                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
                    correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
