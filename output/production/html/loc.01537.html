            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">It is pretty much the same with me, as when I wrote my former letters—still
                home here with my mother, not busy at any thing particular but
                taking a good deal of comfort—It has been very hot here, but one stands it
                better here than in Washington, on account perhaps of the sea-air—I am still
                feeling well, &amp; am out around every day.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There was quite a brush in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N. Y.</span>​  on Wednesday—the Irish lower orders
                Catholic had determined that the Orange parade protestant should be put
                down—mob fired &amp; threw stones—military fired on mob—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="between​ ">bet.</span>​  30 and 40 killed, over a hundred wounded—but you have seen all about
                it in papers—it was all up in a distant part of the city, 3 miles from Wall
                street—five-sixths of the city went on with its business just the same as any
                other day—I saw a big squad of prisoners carried along under guard. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01537.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01537.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01537.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>—they
                reminded me of the squads of rebel prisoners brought in Washington, six years

            <p class="tei_p">—The <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N. Y.</span>​  police looked &amp; behaved splendidly—no fuss, few words, but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">action</span>—great, brown, bearded, able, American looking
                fellows, (Irish stock, though, many of them)—I had great pleasure in looking
                on them—something new, to me, it quite set me up to see such chaps, all dusty
                &amp; worn, looked like veterans—</p>

                road—give my best regards to my friends among the drivers &amp;

                together again, as my leave is up on the 22d—I am
                now going to take a bath &amp; dress myself to go over to New York. Love to you, my
                dearest boy, &amp; good bye for this time</p>
