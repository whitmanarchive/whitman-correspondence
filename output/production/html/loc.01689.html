                <span class="tei_salute">Dear William O'Connor:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">As you were interested in Mr. Parton's money-borrowing
                item about me, I enclose you the receipts signed &amp; given me by his Attorney at
                the time, (June, 1857.)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> The sum borrowed by me of Mr. Parton was Two hundred
                dollars. He had, just before, kindly volunteered the loan himself, without the least
                request or hint from me. I then declined, but afterward borrowed the money, &amp;
                gave a short-time Note. I felt soon, &amp; feel now, that it was a great impropriety
                on my part, &amp; it has caused me much compunction &amp; real unhappiness since.
                Any how when the time for paying the note came, I had no money. Mr. Parton then put
                the matter in the hands of his Attorney, Mr. Oliver Dyer, who sued. My recollection
                is that I confessed judgment, &amp; proposed to Mr. Dyer that he should receive
                payment in goods. He came by appointment to my room in Classon avenue, Brooklyn,
                June 17, 1857, talked over the matter, behaved very kindly, positively accepted
                there &amp; then, &amp; conveyed away, goods to the amount of One hundred and eighty
                one dollars, and receipted for them, on account. He also, for the balance,
                conditionally accepted other goods, (which he also conveyed away with him,) on the
                agreement between us that if they, when more deliberately examined, proved
                acceptable, they would requite the balance, &amp; the debt would be considered paid;
                otherwise they would be returned, &amp; the balance would still stand against me.
                These goods he retained, and subsequently told me that they had proved acceptable,
                and consented to give me a receipt in full, &amp; satisfaction paper—but, (I
                think,) said the latter would require the signature of Mr. Parton. This was a
                meeting either in the street, or on the Brooklyn ferry. On meeting him afterwards in
                a similar way, once or twice, I mentioned the matter of a receipt in full, but never
                pressed it—never procured such receipt, nor the original note either.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I consider the debt <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">paid</span>—(though if I had wealth,
                to-day, I should certainly pay it over again, in cash.) Among the goods rendered I
                remember an oil painting, an original, of marked beauty &amp; value, by Jesse
                    Talbot,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> illustrating a scene
                from Pilgrim's Progress, worth from four to five hundred dollars. This I put, if I
                remember right, at one hundred dollars. I presume Mr. Dyer or Mr. Parton has it yet.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The enclosed receipt, marked 1,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> was, on turning over the goods,
                written by me &amp; signed, by Mr. Dyer, who then remarked that he would also give
                me one in more technical form, and wrote, signed, &amp; handed me the receipt marked
                    2<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—I presume, (but do not know for
                certain,) that Mr. Dyer considers the debt fully paid.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">(The balance of thirty five dollars mentioned, besides the one hundred &amp; eighty
                one includes sixteen dollars as Mr. Dyer's fee, or more probably costs of suit, over
                &amp; above the original two hundred.) </p>

                    never been adequately explained. This letter, with the accompanying documents
                    (reproduced in Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.49.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span> [1906–1996],
                    3:237–239), was Walt Whitman's version, written at the insistence of
                    O'Connor when the story "was bandied about Washington—got into the papers"
                    (3:235). Involved according to Whitman were the "venom, jealousies,
                    opacities…[of] a woman" (3:235–236), probably Parton's wife, the
                    poet Fanny Fern; yet she was the first woman to praise Whitman publicly (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Dissected</span>, 146–154, 162–165). James
                    Parton (1822–1891) was a journalist and, according to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span>, "the most successful
                    biographer of his generation." Shortly before Whitman had borrowed money, Parton
                    had published his first best seller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life of Horace
                        Greeley</span> (1855). See Oral S. Coad, "Whitman vs. Parton," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Journal of the Rutgers University Library</span>, 4 (December
