                and deepened my consciousness
                of great things, of beautiful
                things, of everything that lives.
                In writing to you at this 
                late time (for I knew your
                poems many years back)
                I do what I have often 
                wished to do.—Thank you.

                Christmas Day brought me a
                present of all your writings—original 
                editions—and hence
                this movement of admiration
                and love towards you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is fine to have your words, 
                your brave sweet words, here
                where old Rome crumbles and
                new Rome grows; it is fine
                to have your visions of the 
                States, of men and women
                in our land, while I am
                close to the Coliseum,
                not far from the Pantheon
                and the Appian Way.
                I shall write. Your 
                poems are an Appian
                Way for the triumphal

                thoughts of the American, and you celebrate
                a theatre of action greater than Rome's
                Coliseum in celebrating our wide land.
                I shall hope for the chance to say publically
                what I now write to you. I have been
                several years in Rome. I have my studies
                here—for I am a painter. I trust that
                the time may come when, before this year
                has gone—I may have the pleasure
                of seeing you.

                    to Italy, where he studied painting and dedicated himself to finding forgotten
