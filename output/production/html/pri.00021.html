                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Yours of April 19 both <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —with draft on Drexel &amp; Co. for £28.4—most acceptable. The books, according to list sent, will now be prepared, packed, &amp; sent, (together with your &amp; Mrs. Gilchrist's copies, which have been waiting) probably to London express, of which I will advise you more explicitly by letter to follow this probably within two or three days.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I repeat what I have already written you—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">accept all subscriptions</span>—all will be supplied, 
                upon remittance—(I am already putting another small edition to press)—the price will invariably be $10 the set—$5 each Vol. can be had separately, 
                or together, as wanted—Each will contain portraits &amp; my autograph. The Two, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Rivulets</span> 
                comprise my complete works (the latter Vol. as you see, includes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Memoranda of the War</span> as a constituent part.)
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I do not approve of Mr Conway's letter of April 4—it was unneeded, hurtful to my case, &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="joined​ ">join'd</span>​  with his allusions to the matter in his public American correspondence, an insult 
                to Mr Buchanan, through me—as such I decidedly resent &amp; disavow it—Every point in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Buchanan's​ ">B's</span>​  March 11 
                letter to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">News</span>, is well taken, &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">true without exception</span>—particularly 
                all about the American critics, publishers, editors, "poets" &amp;c—even what he says about my "impoverishment" is much, 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">much nearer the truth</span> than Mr Conways and Lord Houghton's rose-colored illusion varnish—if Mr C. 
                instead of intellectual possessed sympathetic delicacy &amp; insight (I don't think he possesses either) he could have 
                divined better about me &amp; my affairs, not only now here in Camden, but times past in the beginning.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I send my love &amp; thanks to W B Scott—I shall try to write a line to him, to C W Reynell, to J L Warren, to A G Dew-Smith, &amp; one or two others, soon as I can. I heartily thank my good friends of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Secularist</span>. 
                I am glad you printed off, &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="furnished​ ">furnish'd</span>​  friends with copies of my letter of March 17—upon reading it in print, 
                I find it exactly describes the situation, &amp; my wishes—&amp; I reëndorse it—(if you have any copies spare, 
                send me two or three more in next paper you send.)
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The drafting on Drexel &amp; Co. the Philadelphia bankers, is perfectly convenient to me.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am feeling pretty comfortable as I write—have been out a little nearly every day for a week—some days across the river here, 
                the broad Delaware—This is one of my good mornings (it is now between 8 and 9) have finished my breakfast, coffee, 
                Graham bread &amp; mutton chop—good night's sleep, last night.—occupy myself two or three hours every day 
                when not too ill, with my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">book business</span>, letters, &amp;c—also with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the baby</span> boy, 
                my brother's 6 months infant, very fine &amp; bright, (of course)—takes much of my time, &amp; is a delightful diversion 
                to me—the young one knows me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">so well</span>, &amp; is always happy when tended by me—</p>
            
            <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">&amp; so, 
                my dear friend, good bye for this time—&amp; God bless you &amp; yours.</span>
