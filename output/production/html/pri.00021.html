            <p class="tei_p">Yours of April 19<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> both <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —with draft on Drexel &amp; Co. for £28.4—most acceptable.

            <p class="tei_p">I repeat what I have already written you—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">accept all subscriptions</span>—all will be supplied, 
                upon remittance—(I am already putting another small edition to press)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—the price will invariably be $10 the set—$5 each Vol. can be had separately, 
                or together, as wanted—Each will contain portraits &amp; my autograph. The Two, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Rivulets</span> 
                comprise my complete works (the latter Vol. as you see, includes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Memoranda of the War</span> as a constituent part.)

            <p class="tei_p">I do not approve of Mr Conway's letter of April 4<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—it was unneeded, hurtful to my case,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> &amp; <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="joined​ ">join'd</span>​  with his allusions to the matter in his public American correspondence, an insult

                letter to the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">News</span>, is well taken, &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">true without exception</span>—particularly 
                all about the American critics, publishers, editors, "poets" &amp;c—even what he says about my "impoverishment" is much, 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">much nearer the truth</span> than Mr Conways and Lord Houghton's rose-colored illusion varnish—if Mr C. 
                instead of intellectual possessed sympathetic delicacy &amp; insight (I don't think he possesses either) he could have 
                divined better about me &amp; my affairs, not only now here in Camden, but times past in the beginning.</p>

                Graham bread &amp; mutton chop—good night's sleep, last night.—occupy myself two or three hours every day 
                when not too ill, with my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">book business</span>, letters, &amp;c—also with <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the baby</span> boy, 
                my brother's 6 months infant, very fine &amp; bright, (of course)—takes much of my time, &amp; is a delightful diversion 
                to me—the young one knows me <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">so well</span>, &amp; is always happy when tended by me—</p>
