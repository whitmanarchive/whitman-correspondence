            <p class="tei_p">I sent my article on you to Walsh<a href="#n4283" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4283">1</a> some weeks ago—have not heard from him but assume he will use it
                soon. I will write him again if I do not hear this week. I thought it but fair that
                he should print an authentic report he has printed so many that were not true.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very busy lecturing and writing now. I want to get out a volume of stories this
                fall—stories illustrative of the west and of social injustice. I am now
                bargaining with Roberts bros. thereto.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
