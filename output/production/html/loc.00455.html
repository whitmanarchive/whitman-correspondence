                    after consulting with numerous doctors in St. Louis and the East, Mattie learned
                    that she had cancer. Jeff's letters from this period provide a detailed account
                    of her struggle with and death from the disease. Jeff hoped that Mother Whitman
                    and Walt would visit, partly to ease the emotional strain and partly because he
                    knew they had little time to see Mattie. Illness, however, prevented such
                    visits, and Jeff and the girls were left alone to cope with the death. As Hattie
                    wrote Walt two days after her mother's funeral, "Every body is very kind out
                    here but if one of you could only be here it would be so pleasant for Papa. Dear
                    Papa feels so badly" (February 24, 1873 [Walt Whitman Papers, Library of
                    Congress]). </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00455_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00455_n2"><span>Mattie and her
                    daughters had been to St. Paul and Wyoming, Minnesota, in hopes of improving

                    new church and suggests that it was the church music that engaged the limited
                    mental powers of his brother. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00455_n8 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00455_n8"><span>Starr &amp; Co.,
