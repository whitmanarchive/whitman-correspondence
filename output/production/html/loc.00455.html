               <p class="tei_p">Mattie has returned from St. Paul but I am sorry to say is hardly as well as when she went away  Up to yesterday she was very sick but seemed to be quite a good deal better this morning—A few days since when the doctor came to see her he told her that he thought he would have her go to Philadelphia again to see Dr Gross and also to New York to see Dr Clark—Of course if she comes I will write George—if she continues to gain she will not come yet awhile</p>
               <p class="tei_p">I heard her tell Hattie this morning that she would certainly write you a letter to-day—</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Enclosed I send draft for $25. and I want it expended thusly  $10. of it George must take and go over to that place in the city that I found out they had good liquors and buy some good wine—California Port and Muscatel Sautern and "sich"—The tother $15 you can do what you please with—but dont go back on me about the wine—</p>
               <p class="tei_p">How is George and Loo—and Ed—I suppose Ed has hunted up an "organ" before this—</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Matters go middling well with me—have been very busy—had no time to do anything—could'nt even go a fishing</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Love to all—tell Walt that I wish he would come and see us—shall leave it to Mat to persuade you and Loo and George out here—Hat and Jess are as well as can be  I sometimes think they are "weller"</p>
               <p class="tei_p">Good bye—Keep up your temper and dont get tight</p>
