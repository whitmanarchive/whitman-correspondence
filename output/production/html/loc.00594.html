         <p class="tei_p">I have not forgotten you in the wanderings from Washington here.  After five days and nights jolting in the cars I reached this point and was put on duty instanter—And such duty!  Why I have worked night and day and it appears there is more to do now than when I came.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">They only allow one steward to each Hospital, and it is an irksome office when such is the case. I am doing finely and in the course of a few weeks I think will have some leisure time. The Hospitals here were in a destitute condition, compared with those of the North. When I came to this Hospital they had no clothes to change <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">one fourth</span> of the patients. I immediately appealed to my lady friends and patriots in Philadelphia, and they have sent me on a fine lot of sanitary stores, yet not enough for the wants of the many admitted. Our Hospt is a large five story building and accommodates between 300 &amp; 400 patients, most of whom are wounded in the continual skirmishing about Murfreesboro and Franklin.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have never had better health in my life, perhaps I can explain it to you. I have five young ladies who act in the capacity of nurses—i e, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">one of them is French</span>, young and beautiful to set your eyes upon. Can you not visit us and note for yourself? I think a change of climate will be beneficial.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How are Jack and Amos? I wish you would give me Amos's address, as I have lost the one he gave me. My regards to them and hope they are out of Campbell Hospital. What became of poor Dick?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been so busy I have neglected all correspondence so you will readily forget the seeming neglect</p>
            <span class="tei_closer tei_closer_rend_right">
               <span class="tei_salute">Hoping to hear from you at an early period I remain</span>
               <span class="tei_salute">Very respectfully</span>
               <span class="tei_salute">Your humble</span>

            </span>
         
         
            <p class="tei_p">P..S. Send me that promised photograph and as soon as I find out your quarters I will return compt Will</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I will tell you of the many secesh at the next writing</p>
