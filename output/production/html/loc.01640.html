                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Here I am yet, in my big chair in the parlor—I am up &amp; around, but not very
                well—I am having a return, (though not so severe,) of those old <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blurs</span> that used to trouble me—have had a succession of
                them all day to day so far—begun yesterday—but I have no doubt they
                will pass over. It is cloudy &amp; sulky here to-day, partially thawing—&amp;
                is raining now—I have been out, managed to walk round the block, but had to
                return—did not feel well. Pete there is nothing new—I got your last
                letter—have rec'd letters from Mrs. O'Connor—</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01640.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01640.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01640.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

                <p class="tei_p">I have no doubt I shall
                feel better—my sickness comes &amp; goes—&amp; my relief spells the
                same—I shall probably have to stay in the rest of the day &amp;
                evening—which is very dull &amp; stupid for me—in fact quite
                dismal—But I must not write what will make you blue—would rather cheer
                you up—I am still continuing the pieces in the Weekly Graphic—(will be ended with one or two more)—expect to have a piece in
                next Harper, (March) but am not certain—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Just as I close, the carrier has tapped at the window—he brings me a letter
                from Boston, &amp; in it a check paying a debt due me a long time, &amp;
                which I had quite given up—which puts me in better spirits—good bye for
                present, my dear loving son—</p>
