                well—I am having a return, (though not so severe,) of those old <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blurs</span> that used to trouble me—have had a succession of
                them all day to day so far—begun yesterday—but I have no doubt they
                will pass over. It is cloudy &amp; sulky here to-day, partially thawing—&amp;
                is raining now—I have been out, managed to walk round the block, but had to
                return—did not feel well. Pete there is nothing new—I got your last
                letter—have rec'd letters from Mrs. O'Connor—</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01640.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01640.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01640.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01640.002.jpg</span>

                evening—which is very dull &amp; stupid for me—in fact quite
                dismal—But I must not write what will make you blue—would rather cheer
                you up—I am still continuing the pieces in the Weekly Graphic<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—(will be ended with one or two more)—expect to have a piece<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in

            <p class="tei_p">Just as I close, the carrier has tapped at the window—he brings me a letter

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
