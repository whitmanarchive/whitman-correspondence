            <p class="tei_p">When a man has ventured to dedicate his work to another without authority or permission, I think that he is bound to make confession of the liberty he has taken. This must be my excuse for sending to you the crude poem in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  you may perchance detect some echo, faint &amp; feeble, of your Calamus.—As I have put pen to paper I cannot refrain from saying that since the time when I first took up Leaves of Grass in a friend's rooms at Trinity College Cambridge six

years ago till now, your poems have been my constant companions. I have read them in Italy by the shores of the Mediterranean, under pine trees or caverns washed by the sea—&amp; in Switzerland among the alpine pastures &amp; beside the glaciers. At home I have found in them pure air &amp; health—the free breath of the world—when often cramped by illness &amp; the cares of life. What one man can do

            <p class="tei_p">I say this in order that I may, as simply as may be, tell you how much I owe to you. He who makes the words of a man his spiritual food for years is greatly that man's debtor.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As for the poem I send you—it is of course implicit already in your Calamus, especially in "Scented herbage of my breast."

I have but set to an old tune the new divine song—: for you know that on this side of the Atlantic at least people most readily listen to old tunes. I fear greatly I have marred the purity &amp; beauty of your thought by my bad singing.—I am an Englishman, married, with 3 children, &amp; am aged 30.—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Answer to this I scarcely expect, as I certainly do not deserve it. The poem I send is due for reasons already set forth. It is a printer's proof at present &amp; no more.</p>
