               <span class="tei_salute">Mr. Whitman Dear Sir</span>
            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I will now improve a few moments to pen you a few lines in accordance to your request.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I left Washington last Monday at 3 oclock in the afternoon and arrived in Baltimore at 5 Oclock and I then reached this Citty and took the cars again at 9 Oclock and arrived here in Williamsport the next morning at 10 oclock.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a very pleasant passage and enjoyed the ride very much but yet I found that my wounds were somewhat situated and they have been more sore than usual and so I have not gone about the place a great deal yet, but what I have seen so far I think I like the place very much.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Business is chiefly lumbering and it is carried on in a more extensive manner than I have ever before seen it and the place is fast building up and will very soon be incorporated into a citty.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I like the place very much what I have seen of it yet I have not been about but a little and I cannot write you so much as I would like to and so I will write you again. I want to hear from Washington and how things are moving and will be much pleased to hear from you and I will try to write you more in my next letter.</p>

               <span class="tei_salute">I remain yours truly,</span>
