               <span class="tei_salute">My dear brother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter has only just reached me though I see the Brooklyn post office stamp is January 27th—I was gratified with Babcock's and Smith's letters, though I am very sorry they neither of them mentioned the date of Lt Caldwell's letter from Danville.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> If it should be much later than George's, which was November 27th, it would be a relief to know it—but I presume it was one of the same batch. Jeff, I have this morning written to Capt Mason,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> telling him where George is, &amp; asking him, as that would be ten times more likely to get through, if he will have (or direct some proper person) to put up a box of things to eat, &amp; given him George's address to send it through the lines, &amp; said that I or you would pay the bill of course, &amp; be most deeply obliged to him &amp; that I would have enclosed the money in the letter I sent him, but thought it safer to wait &amp; see whether it reached him.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I have written to George since I have been here in Washington. Also a few lines to Han. We have had very cold mean weather here ever since I arrived till to-day—it is now moderated &amp; very pleasant overhead.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am quite comfortable, have a comfortable room enough, with a wood stove, &amp; a pile of wood in the room, a first rate &amp; good big bed, &amp; a very friendly old secesh landlady whose husband &amp; son are off in the Southern army—she is different from any I have found yet here, is very obliging, starts my fire for me at 5 o'clock every afternoon, &amp; lights the gas, even, &amp; then turns it down to be ready for me when I come home. I get my meals where I can—they are poor &amp; expensive—You speak of the Indian office—it is a Bureau in the Department of the interior, which has charge of quite a large mass of business relating to the numerous Indian tribes in West &amp; Northwest, large numbers of whom are under annuities, supplies, &amp;c for the government. All I have hitherto employed myself about has been making copies of reports &amp; Bids, &amp;c for the office to send up to the Congressional Committee on Indian Affairs. It is easy enough—I take things very easy—the rule is to come at 9 and go at 4—but I don't come at 9, and only stay till 4 when I want, as at present to finish a letter for the mail—I am treated with great courtesy, as an evidence of which I have to inform you that since I began this letter, I have been sent for by the cashier to receive my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PAY</span> for the arduous &amp; invaluable services I have already rendered to the government—I feel quite well, perhaps not as completely so as I used to was, but I think I shall get so this spring—as I did indeed feel yesterday better than I have since I was taken sick last summer.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I spent yesterday afternoon in Armory Square Hospital,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> &amp; had a real good time, &amp; the boys had too. Jeff, you need not be afraid about my overdoing the matter. I shall go regularly enough, but shall be on my guard against trouble. I am also going to some of the camps about here, there is a great chance among them to do good, &amp; they are interesting places every way, for one who goes among the men. I have thought every day of Mother—dear Mother, I hope she gets along well this bitter weather—(about the hoop iron, I think it was the right thing to do<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—the least they can do is to take it off)—My dear brother, you must by all means <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">come</span> &amp; see me—Martha, my dear sister, I send you &amp; the dear little torments my best, best love—Jeff, give my respects to Mr. Lane &amp; Dr Ruggles<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—</p>

                    George's regiment, wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.00847">January 21,
                        1865</a>, and informed him that the prisoners were "pretty hard up for
                    grub" and wanted things like "Salt Pork and hard tack" sent to them. Aaron
                    Smith, probably of the Fifty-first Regiment, had written to Whitman on <a href="nyp.00228">May 14</a> and <a href="nyp.00229">July 13,
                        1864</a>, while he was a patient at Carver Hospital, Washington. On <a href="loc.00867">January 21, 1865</a>, from Petersburg, he asked Whitman
                    to send supplies to the Danville Military Prison. Lieutenant William Caldwell
                    had been captured at the same time as George. He was a captain when Whitman
                    mentioned him again in a letter from <a href="wwh.00008">May 25, 1865</a>.
                    According to jottings in a notebook, dated May 23–24 (Clifton Waller
                    Barrett Collection, University of Virginia), Caldwell was born in Scotland and
                    was 27; he had been "in the same fights as George." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00838_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00838_n2"><span>See Whitman's letter from
