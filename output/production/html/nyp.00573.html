            <p class="tei_p">The $16.50 on acc't of photo. sales, came safely to hand &amp; this is the
                receipt—with best thanks—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Herbert Gilchrist hurried off, &amp; I did not have a chance to
                mention to him ab't the London agency for the photos. I should suggest however the
                selection of some established shop or name in London as the best place—some
                place where such things are in their line—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I like best Nos. 3, 6 and 8 of the photos. Would send those only—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am ab't as usual—</p>
