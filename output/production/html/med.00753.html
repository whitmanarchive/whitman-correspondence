                <span class="tei_salute">Dear W.S.K.</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">It is of no importance whether I had read Emerson before starting L. of G. or
                    not.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> The fact happens to be positively that I had
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span>. The basis and body and genesis of the L[eaves] differing I suppose from
                Em[erson]<a href="#n1044" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1044">2</a> and many grandest poets and artists[—]was and is that I found and
                find everything in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">common concrete</span>, the broadcast
                materials, the flesh, the common passions, the tangible and visible, etc., and in
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the average</span>, and that I radiate, work from, these
                outward—or rather hardly wish to leave here but to remain and celebrate it
                all. Whatever the amount of this may be or not be, it is certainly <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not Emersonian</span>, 
                not Shakspere, not Tennyson—indeed, the antipodes of
                E. and the others in essential respects. But I have not suggested or exprest myself
                well in my book unless I have in a sort included them and their sides and
                expressions too—as this orb the world means and includes all climes, all
                sorts, L. of G.'s word is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the body, including all</span>, including
                the intellect and soul; E.'s word is mind (or intellect or soul).</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">If I were to unbosom to you in the matter I should say that I never cared so very
                much for E.'s writings, prose or poems, but from his first personal visit and two
                hours with me (in Brooklyn in 1866 or '65?)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> I had a
                strange attachment and love for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">him</span> and his contact, talk,
                company, magnetism. I welcomed <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">him</span> deepest and
                always—yet it began and continued <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">on his part</span>, quite
                entirely; <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">HE</span> always sought <span class="smallcaps tei_hi tei_hi_rend_smallcaps">ME.</span> We probably had a dozen (possibly twenty) of these
                meetings, talks, walks, etc.—some five or six times (sometimes New York,
                sometimes Boston) had good long dinners together. I was very happy—I don't
                think I was at my best with him—he always did most of the talking—I am
                sure he was happy too. That visit to me at Sanborn's, by E. and family, and the
                splendid formal-informal family dinner <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">to me</span>, next day,
                Sunday, Sept. 18, '81, by E., Mrs. E. and all, I consider not only a victor-event in
                my life,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> but it is an after-explanation of so much and
                offered as an apology, peace-offering, justification, of much that the world knows
                not of. My dear friend, I think I know R.W.E. better than anybody else knows
                him—and loved him in proportion, but quietly. Much was revealed to me.</p>

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
