            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 7th from N.Y. rec'd last night. I will scratch off some suggestions:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">In composing the letter, let it be brief, and don't mention the subject—or, if
                you do, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">just say indefinitely that it is about Abraham
                    Lincoln</span> (which you may do, if you think proper)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I would like Gilder's name on the letter—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The suggestion (Gilder's) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">about 8 or 10 names only</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good ones only</span>—should be carried out. About the Hall I
                leave to your selection (not the very biggest ones, however, would seem to me
                best)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I would like Whitelaw Reid's name to cap the
                list—Couldn't the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span> man, Schuyler (if he is there yet?) come next?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Elliott F. Shepard the lawyer, might be a good name.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Take [J. H.] Johnston into your councils, in any business and pecuniary
                arrangements—he is very 'cute and I consider him a true friend of mine.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am particular about the names. Let [Joel] Benton have
                my letters, take as much as possible my point of view, and he might write to me
                here.</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_signed">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>

            
                <p class="tei_p">Private</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I care little—or rather nothing at all—about Bayard Taylor's or G. W. Curtis's names
                    on the letter. Don't want them. If they get on, let them be, of course—but
                    don't you make any point about getting them. I suppose you understand me.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Of course the letters I write you are for perusal by all my friends—Gilder,
                    Swinton, Benton, &amp;c.—but if I write <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">private</span>, it
                    is for you alone.</p>
