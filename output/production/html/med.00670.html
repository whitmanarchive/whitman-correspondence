            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 7th from N.Y. rec'd last night. I will scratch off some suggestions:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">In composing the letter, let it be brief, and don't mention the subject—or, if
                you do, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">just say indefinitely that it is about Abraham
                    Lincoln</span> (which you may do, if you think proper)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I would like Gilder's<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> name on the letter—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The suggestion (Gilder's) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">about 8 or 10 names only</span>—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">good ones only</span>—should be carried out. About the Hall I
                leave to your selection (not the very biggest ones, however, would seem to me
                best)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I would like Whitelaw Reid's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> name to cap the
                list—Couldn't the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World</span> man, Schuyler<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> (if he is there yet?) come next?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Elliott F. Shepard the lawyer,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> might be a good name.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Take [J. H.] Johnston into your councils, in any business and pecuniary
                arrangements—he is very 'cute and I consider him a true friend of mine.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am particular about the names. Let [Joel] Benton<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> have
                my letters, take as much as possible my point of view, and he might write to me
                here.</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_signed">Walt Whitman</span>
            </span>

            
                <p class="tei_p">Private</p>
                <p class="tei_p">I care little—or rather nothing at all—about Bayard Taylor's<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> or G. W. Curtis's<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> names
                    on the letter. Don't want them. If they get on, let them be, of course—but
                    don't you make any point about getting them. I suppose you understand me.</p>
                <p class="tei_p">Of course the letters I write you are for perusal by all my friends—Gilder,
                    Swinton, Benton, &amp;c.—but if I write <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">private</span>, it
                    is for you alone.</p>

                    (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Scribner's
                        Monthly</span> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Century</span>, from 1881 until his death. During his
                    lifetime, Gilder also published several collections of poetry. Whitman had met
                    Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1955], 482). He attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
                    Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the New York
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder one
                    of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art delirium"

                    disliked by Whitman's friends. Burroughs termed Curtis "an orator that fairly

                    O'Connor observed in a letter to Burroughs, "The artificial mountain in Brooklyn
