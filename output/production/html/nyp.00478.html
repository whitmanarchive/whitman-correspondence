                    Feb 23 83 | 6 30 PM; Washington, Recd. | Feb | 24 | 4 30 AM | 1883 | 2. The date
                    of this post card, obviously sent later than the preceding one, is established
                    by O'Connor's endorsement, the postmark, and the reference to O'Connor's
                    manuscript. In his reprint of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span> Richard
                    Maurice Bucke included a reference to Richard Henry Stoddard's review of the
                    pamphlet in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Round Table</span> on January 20, 1866, and
                    printed a letter written to the magazine by Charles Lanman and O'Connor's reply
                    (130–132). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
