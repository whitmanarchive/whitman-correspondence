                    letter, Herbert Gilchrist had settled on Long Island and was attempting

                    observes, "[H]is life was really a veiled tragedy. . . . In the end he snuffed

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was the father of Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in
                    Camden. Harry's parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White
                    Horse Farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several
                    occasions. For more on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G.
