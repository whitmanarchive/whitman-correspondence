                    (1862–1919) was born in Bodh Gaya, India, to Anglo-Irish parents. Colles
                    attended Wesley College in Dublin, and by 1896 was working as a journalist for
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dublin Daily Express</span> before moving to a cultural
                    review paper, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Irish Figaro</span>, which he owned and edited
                    with his wife, Annie (Sweeney). He also founded a fraternity periodical, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Irish Masonry Monthly</span>, and achieved notoriety in 1911
                    with his memoir, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Castle and Court House: Being
                        Reminiscences of 30 Years in Ireland</span> (London: Werner Laurie). Known as
                    a theater critic, editor, and poet, Colles contributed to many anthologies and
                    periodicals, and his poems "Love's Question" and "Her Coming" appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gems of Poesy by Present Day Authors</span>, edited by Charles
                    F. Forshaw, a member of the Council of the Royal Society of Literature (London:
                    Kenning, 1901). Colles also edited volumes of poetry by Thomas Lovell Beddoes
                    (Routledge, 1907), George Darley (Routledge, 1908) and Hartley Coleridge
                    (London: Muses Library, 1908). His final work was the four-volume <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The History of Ulster: From the Earliest Times to the Present
                        Day</span>, published the year of his death (London: Gresham, 1919). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01304_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.01304_n1"><span>This postal card is

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,
