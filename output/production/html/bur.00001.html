                    York to attend the funeral of William Cullen Bryant on June 14, 1878, and stayed
                    with John H. Johnston, a jeweler and old friend. As the letter indicates,
                    Whitman paid a visit to John Burroughs before he returned to New York, where he
                    remained until July 10. See Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
