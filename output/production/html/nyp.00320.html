        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your welcome letter reached me to-day. Yours from Washington of over two weeks since, 
        also came safe. Since my letter of about three weeks since to Charles Eldridge—in which I wrote to you also<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—I have not improved any—the distress in my head 
        has not abated—some spells are very bad indeed—(but it fluctuates, some days, 
        or parts of days, leaving me comparatively comfortable.) Nor can I walk any better—some of the time, not so well—My saving points are pretty good nights' rest, 
        and a fair appetite, digestion, &amp;c. Still I can see I am gradually being pulled, 
        and, though I have not at all given up hope of eventual recovery, I do not shut 
        my eyes to the other termination—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am very comfortable here, as I believe I told you, occupying mother's former rooms, 
        (a north &amp; south one, second floor,) and with all her nice &amp; homely furniture 
        &amp; bed &amp; chairs—&amp; living day &amp; night in her memory &amp; atmosphere.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">We are having the hottest sort of weather here—in New York and Washington it must be terrible—but here I find I stand it quite well. I rec'd a note from John Burroughs telling me 
        of his flitting visit to Newport &amp; call on you. I have been waiting till I felt stronger, 
        to go to Atlantic City (Jersey sea shore) or Long Island, but in my present condition 
        feel it best to stay here—(Nelly, I don't feel as well as when you 
        used to come there to White's)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>—I shall be glad indeed to have Charles Eldridge come here &amp; see me—&amp; it will be a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">real disappointment</span> if he does not—but I count on his coming 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">without fail</span>—I hope to get a letter from him soon.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I still manage to get out a little, towards evening—not always, but nearly every day—get to the ferry boat, &amp; sail to &amp; fro across the Delaware, occasionally—I had seen in the newspapers of William's appointment, &amp; was truly pleased—I hear from Peter Doyle quite regularly—he is well, &amp; working at his dangerous post 
        on the Baltimore &amp; Potomac RR—I miss him much—&amp; I miss you too, Nelly—I am very lonesome here, (&amp; yet I keep up very good heart)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">If Charles Eldridge is there, I send him my love, &amp; the same to all—to your daughter Jeannie, (whom you do not mention) &amp; to your sister 
        &amp; the Doctor,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> &amp; all who in good will enquire for me—It is now between 3 and 4 Saturday afternoon—I am sitting here in mother's great arm chair—we have had a hot day—but a breeze is springing up—it is a shady quiet spot here—I shall try to hobble out soon though I am quite feeble.
      </p>

                    Whites' from March 1, 1871, until he left Washington. He had paid $236 in
                    rent through June 10, 1873 (The Library of Congress #73). On November 28, 1873,
                    Dr. George A. White, a chiropodist, acknowledged for his wife receipt of $28
                    "on account . . . for rent of room etc from May 1st/73" (Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection). Whitman gave up one room at the Whites' on June 10, 1873: "Kept the
                    other at $2.50 a month" (The Library of Congress #68). See also Whitman's
