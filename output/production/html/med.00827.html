                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have hoped daily to write in reply to your letters of April 8th and 23d, and the
                postal card of May 7th, but between office business and illness I have been
                prevented. Last night I got another of May 14th, covering the one from Herbert
                Gilrchrist,<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">1</a> which I send today to Doctor Bucke,<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">2</a> as you desire. I am grieved to learn by these last advices
                that you are ill lately. Your trouble all through seems twin to
                mine—semi-paralysis, indigestion, constipation, etc. But who can be well, or
                who being sick can help being sicker, in such weather as we have had this spring?
                The last five days have been simply horrible—cold, wet, raw, diabolical, and
                we are all the worse for it. I think we will have to do like the
                Greenlanders—when the weather is bad, they boil the thermometer!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I saw your little piece in the Herald of the 14th.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> No fear of your distempers getting
                into your compositions! Your temperament is indomitable. One would think you had the 
                sun for a solar plexus. I basked in the mellowness of your last letters as in the
                gold and azure October weather of which I am so fond. I often feel deep regret that
                you should have become ill. It simply proves the existence of the devil, whom Starr
                King<a href="#n4263" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4263">4</a> called the fourth person of the Trinity! (Certainly he's powerful enough to be
                so styled.) But for him, or what he stands for, you might have reached a hundred,
                hale, sturdy, impregnable, and like the best druid of the grove. So may it be
                yet!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I read with a jovial heart of your trencher work at the planked shad and champagne up
                at the old tavern on the Delaware,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> and, later, with your friends, where champagne
                and oysters ruled the board. Didn't I wish to be along! Didn't my lower stomach
                shout to my upper stomach with loud halloos!  O there's fun in this sad world yet!  I hope you'll have lots of it.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Apropos of the Devil, I once had a conception of him, which I worked out in an
                unpublished romance thirty years ago, as a type of intellectual ignorance—that
                is, of word-knowledge as against the knowledge of things. Lately, I had another and
                more grotesque conception of such a being, supernatural and immortal, but, simply
                having all the diseases! Wouldn't be a bad idea, would it? How very diabolic such
                a devil would naturally be, wouldn't he?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Herbert Gilchrist's letter was very interesting. His reference to your bust would
                have been very enigmatical, but for a card I had from Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">6</a>
                which helped me to infer that it was Morse's<a href="#n0862" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0862">7</a> bust that was
                alluded to.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In a couple of days the weather will change for the better, and you will feel
                revived. I hope you will ride out all you can in the Spring air.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You speak of Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton<a href="#n4264" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4264">8</a> having been to see you. It is many years
                since I saw her. She used to be very pretty: I hope she is yet. Her fault was in
                being too Araminta-Seraphina-Matilda, and this, life has made her outgrow.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter from Ben Tucker<a href="#n4290" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4290">9</a> about you and your Herald threnody on the Emperor<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">10</a>
                (which I have never seen). He seemed much troubled and cast down. Undoubtedly, he
                has a great regard and veneration for you, and feels hurt.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am delighted at your returns from the Herald, and hope they will continue. Bennett<a href="#n3168" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3168">11</a>
                is certainly the most generous of all the blackguards.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You speak of having the bust of Elias Hicks,<a href="#n4265" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4265">12</a> which must be a grateful possession.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">13</a> I
                hope your article on him is growing.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">14</a> You ought to make it good, and as elaborate as
                possible.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Miserable Cosmopolitan!—to refuse the Lilt of Songs,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">15</a> which has a real and deep 
                thought! Such are these demons.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had your Critic Thought on Shakespeare,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">16</a> and read it many times lately again. It is
                certainly very satisfactory, though I could wish it had certain explanations and
                expansions.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Donnelly's<a href="#n4108" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4108">17</a> book is out, and I have gone through it, though
                hurriedly and in illness. He has done something I don't like—withheld a part
                of the explanation of the cipher, and moreover expounded it so bewilderingly as to
                leave the matter still in debate. Still, the effect is rather tremendous, and
                although the chief journals denounce and lampoon it with all their armory of lying,
                misrepresentation and persiflage, I don't think any fair mind can doubt the validity
                of the cryptograph. The general abuse and ridicule are consoled, so far, by
                Professor Colbert of Chicago vouching for the reality of the figures, and by Mr.
                Bidder, one of the best mathematicians in England, declaring that the cipher is
                surely in the test. But that my illness makes me unfit for composition, I would like
                to review Donnelly's reviewers so far, and would engage to make them skip. Such
                ignorance and such impudence I have rarely seen. The fragments of the cipher story
                in the book are quite amazing and have wonderful vraisemblance. He has a notice of
                me, with other Baconians, and briefly pays good tribute to you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You speak truly of the beautiful hue of the young wheat. I have sometimes thought
                that "wheat-color" would be a justified and telling epithet. The tint is so
                peculiar, so <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">living</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By the way, in looking over Stedman's<a href="#n1043" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1043">18</a> book (the Poets of
                America) I saw how thoroughly and even radically he had modified the article on you.
                It is by no means what it was in the magazine. My talk with him must have sunk
                in.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Goodbye. Nelly<a href="#n4305" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4305">19</a> sends you her love. So do I. Always
                affectionately</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    near this time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters.
                    Walt Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years,
                    and he spoke often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or
                    "Jeannie"). Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off
                    their friendship in late 1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies
                    and the role of emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with
