            <p class="tei_p">For so you seem to me just like a grandfather whom I once knew years ago, but who
                lives in my memory as a childish recollection. No, I have never seen you with my
                physical eyes, but I feel as though I had, and it is my love for your work, and
                through that for yourself that prompts me to write you and declare it. I long thought
                of stretching out my hands across the water in greeting to you, but that diffidence
                I had lest I might be intruding unwarrantably upon your quiet has hitherto prevented
                me. This has now passed away through the kindness of a new-found friend—D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>

May this be my excuse for thrusting my small
                personality into the path of your Kingly one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is now about five years ago, (when I was 21, and looked something like the
                photograph I enclose) since I first remember reading any of your poems, and that
                was in a small anthology. From that time I wished to read more of them, and, making
                discoveries for myself, I at last found "Leaves of Grass"—one of the late
                editions—and rejoiced as over a discovery of hid treasure. Needless to tell
                you, I read it through, and lost no time in buying "Specimen Days."<a href="#n4121" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4121">4</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">It does not need an Indian to find my trail through the "Leaves of Grass." It is
                broad and thick. Thumb marks, ink scratches, pencil notes, and dear old
                stains—each one has its history, and is looked upon as an old friend. Even my
                Bible is not so bemarked.</p>

                what is now mine, and a never-ceasing interest in all that appertains to life. My
                eyes have been opened to a truer view of the Bible, of Shakespeare—yea, of all

                    (1865–1945) was from Manchester, England, one of five children born to

                    (1837–1921). In 1899, he married Helena Harriet Tippins (1872–1939)
                    and the couple had two children, Geoffrey Edmund (1901–1981) and Robert
                    Osborn (1909–1995). English census data record Mercer as a solicitor
                    living in Manchester. His sonnet "Blue and Gold" appeared in the August 24,
                    1889, issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chambers's Journal</span> (544); he also

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
