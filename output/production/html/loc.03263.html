            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">For so you seem to me just like a grandfather whom I once knew years ago, but who
                lives in my memory as a childish recollection. No, I have never seen you with my
                physical eyes, but I feel as though I had, and it is my love for your work, and
                through that for yourself that prompts me to write you and declare it. I long thought
                of stretching out my hands across the water in greeting to you, but that diffidence
                I had lest I might be intruding unwarrantably upon your quiet has hitherto prevented
                me. This has now passed away through the kindness of a new-found friend—D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span>
                    Johnston of Bolton—who tells me he has sent you a
                copy of "Great Thoughts" containing my small addition to the literature appreciative of your
                prophetic messages and high-souled<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03263.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03263.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03263.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> songs. May this be my excuse for thrusting my small
                personality into the path of your Kingly one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It is now about five years ago, (when I was 21, and looked something like the
                photograph I enclose) since I first remember reading any of your poems, and that
                was in a small anthology. From that time I wished to read more of them, and, making
                discoveries for myself, I at last found "Leaves of Grass"—one of the late
                editions—and rejoiced as over a discovery of hid treasure. Needless to tell
                you, I read it through, and lost no time in buying "Specimen Days."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It does not need an Indian to find my trail through the "Leaves of Grass." It is
                broad and thick. Thumb marks, ink scratches, pencil notes, and dear old
                stains—each one has its history, and is looked upon as an old friend. Even my
                Bible is not so bemarked.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Your volume holds a princely place in my ranks of 600; for to it I owe so much of
                what is now mine, and a never-ceasing interest in all that appertains to life. My
                eyes have been opened to a truer view of the Bible, of Shakespeare—yea, of all
                the great minds that have enriched mankind. And for all this—this that makes
                life so truly happy I thank <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I need hardly say how gratified I should be if it pleased you to write to me, if only
                a line.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We may never meet on this earth, and I would like to be as near to you as possible in
                the next way—by a personal letter—In the after-days we shall surely
                meet—somehow, somewhere; and then we shall see, and know, and understand.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">To you—of all of the best that ever God has divined here and
                hereafter—love, honour, glory and<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03263.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03263.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03263.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> power.</p>
