            <p class="tei_p">Middling comfortable &amp; easy—take the bitter water—bowel movement this
                forenoon—weather sunny &amp; cool—I keep a pretty good fire, oak
                wood—sleep fairly nights (from 12 to 5 must be unbroken in the main, when
                favorable)—for breakfast to-day 3 or 4 good stew'd oysters, some Graham bread
                toasted, &amp; a cup of chocolate—ate pretty well (this &amp; yesterday are
                favorable days)—In my eating neither at all ascetic nor sumptuous—pass
                two hours to-day putting my autograph to the poetic motto title to L of G. for the
                big book—Horace bro't the sheets (600 of them) f'm the
                bindery—David McKay has been over to-day—wants a
                different binding for N. B. wh' I agree to at his seeing to &amp;
                expense—thinks the binding I have—like your copy—coarse &amp;
                cheap—very likely—he paid me $106 royalty—I am satisfied with D
                McK—Have been looking over Cardinal Manning's &amp; Col. Ingersoll's pieces in
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">N. A. Review</span>—also Mrs. Carlyle's letters (for
                dessert)— quite a good many visits—a string indeed all day—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our election trial is drawing near a verdict—as I see it, there are some things
                on each side—no great <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">enthusing</span> tho' they (the Rep[ublican]s) try to make it
                so—from the view of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">solidarity</span> of the common people <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of all the globe</span>. I
                lean rather to the Cleveland side, (but I am sometimes squeamish even at
                that)—but it will be all right any how—Y'r welcome letter came
                yesterday—I enclose slip from to-day's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Phil. Press</span> ab't Dr Osler—</p>
