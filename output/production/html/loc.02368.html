                    (1855–1941) was an American educator and librarian. Jordan served as
                    librarian at Vassar College for roughly three years after completing her
                    undergraduate work in 1876, and was an undergraduate tutor at Vassar until
                    relocating to Smith College in 1884. She remained in the English Department
                    until 1921, the same year she received her Ph.D. in Pedagogy from Syracuse
                    University. During her time at Smith, Jordan edited the works of Milton,
                    Emerson, and Burke, and wrote <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correct Writing and

                    administrations as Solicitor of the Treasury under Secretary Solomon P. Chase.
                    In 1888, Jordan publicly withdrew from the Republican Party, stating, "The
                    Republicans now are not in sympathy with the Republican party of Abraham
                    Lincoln's time," criticizing the failure of Reconstruction and the Party's

                    was the head of the Department of Elocution and Dramatic Art at Smith College
                    for over thirty years. Beginning about 1891, Peck maintained a lengthy
                    correspondence with Whitman's friend, the naturalist John Burroughs, who
                    expressed his joy that she was reading Whitman: "...so few women can master this
                    poet and get at the real power and inspiration there is in him. So few men
                    either, for that matter" (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Life and Letters of John
                        Burroughs</span>, ed. Clara Barrus [Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1925], 1:315).
                    At her funeral in 1913, Mary Jordan described Peck as "a woman who believed in
                    high aspiration and personal relationship in her work; she was a woman of
                    infinite patience and sympathy." For more information, see "With the Smith
