                I tho't might amuse you—My physical trouble has
                veer'd quite entirely lately, or more truly added to, &amp; is now that senile
                botheration from prostrate or enlarged or inflamm'd gland, bladder business,
                diabetes—or other worse or less worse form of ailment—Dr Osler was here this afternoon, &amp; is to bring over a surgeon
                expert on 5th P M for more concise examination—It has resulted the last four
                nights in quite no sleep, wh' is a pretty bad factor in my complication—</p>

                book—(trilogy the proof reader at the office calls it)—wh' I am now only
                waiting the hard press'd binders (at present) to achieve &amp; put in form, &amp; I
                will send you one—each of you dear ones for Christmas—(&amp; good much
                may it do you)—The more elaborated court dress with frills, yet waits before

                oysters—some coffee &amp; Graham bread—better to-day—a fair night
                this last, &amp; fair sleep—The gland suffering or whatever it is—the
                distressing recurrent stricture-like spasms ab't from three to ten minutes almost
                continuously the last five days &amp; nights—have let up—&amp; the parts
                at present seem to be assuming something like normal condition—I am sitting in
                my big chair by the fire, the stove—it is sharp &amp; cold, bright &amp;
                sunny—Ed Wilkins (my young Kanuck, my nurse &amp; helper,
                Dr B. sent) has just come in to tell me the result of an errand—&amp; so

                of danger yesterday—Horace continues helpful &amp;
                faithful—Love to you all &amp; as I finish this scrawl glad to give you as I
