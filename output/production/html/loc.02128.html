                It is with profound
                sorrow that I read in the papers
                the news that you are again 
                suffering from your old trouble.
                I trust it is not so serious as
                reported. My regard for you is 
                so great that I am very sorry, not
                to be able to buy more copies of your

                token of sympathy.

                I have demonstrated (what of course 
                you know) that there is no veil—no
                impediment—between your mind
                and your audience, when your
                writings are <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">voiced.</span> The formlessness
                is only seeming not real.

                I have never read a page
                of your poetry, or quoted a line,
                that has not commanded admiration.
                The music is there and the grandeur
                of thought is there, if the reader
                reads, guided by the sense and
                not by the external lining or paragraphing.
                Even very young pupils
                feel the thrill of the deep rolling
                music though the thought may be too
                profound for them to grasp.

                it is supposed you utterly antagonize).

                writing and which I hope to get out this
                coming spring. As the motto-page
                of this volume I have used a paragraph
                from your "Collect" which
                is entitled "Foundation Stayed—then 
                Others." While it is not strictly
                essential to the book, yet I should
                esteem it a favor if you 
                consent to its use. One sentence,

                the Age of Democracy and its thought,
                taking as foundation the splendid
                utterances of Mr. Paine upon the modern
                age. It is in this chapter that
                I place your work. I quote from
                you quite largely both in treating
                of your writings and in treating
                the general theme of present and
                future democratic ideals. I hope
                to be able to please you with my
                treatment of your great work.
                Beside this I am preparing special
