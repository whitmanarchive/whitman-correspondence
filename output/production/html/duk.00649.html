            <p class="tei_p">I write to ask your kind offices in the following described matter:</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent to Doolady<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> six weeks ago an order</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. James Gray, Bookbinder 16 Spruce st. 4th floor, is the custodian of the sheets
                of my Leaves of Grass, &amp; has been the binder for me. The sheets are now at his
                place.</p>
 
            <p class="tei_p">I hear that he has become involved—in fact has failed. If so, I regret it
                    much.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been waiting now over six weeks for the fulfilment of orders I have sent him
                for bound books—&amp; now, under that state of things, I suppose it will not
                be possible for him to do the work.</p>
