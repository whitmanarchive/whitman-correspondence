            <p class="tei_p">One frequently hears it said in connection with the agitation for 
                international copyright that the enactment of the proposed law is 
            desirable not only as a matter of justice to the foreign author, 
            and of protection to the native, but also because the flood of 
            English literature, especially of English fiction, which piracy 
            lets loose sets ideals before our young readers which are contrary 
            to the spirit of American life. I do not quite understand how the 
            English ideal of life differs from the American, but a discussion 
            of the subject which I propose to have in The North American 
            Review will, no doubt, be a source of   
            enlightenment. Will you be one of the symposium and send me your 
            views in an article of two thousand words, or less, for which, 
            of course, I will pay you? The American Ideal in Fictionâ€”that 
            will be the title; and each contributor will be expected to point 
            out everything which he considers objectionable in the habit of 
            reading foreign stories.</p>
