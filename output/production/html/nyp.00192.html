                    George's regiment was engaged in especially heavy fighting near Petersburg,
                    Virginia, in which he repeatedly distinguished himself. John Gibson Wright,
                    captain of the Fifty-first Regiment, reported on August 8, 1864 that, when he
                    had to relinquish command of the regiment, George "discharged the duties of the
                    responsible position to my entire satisfaction, and it affords me great pleasure
                    to speak of the gallant manner in which he has Sustained himself during the
                    entire campaign" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
                    Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). (Wright rose from captain to
                    colonel in the Fifty-first Regiment; he was appointed to the latter position on
                    May 18, 1865. He was taken prisoner with George in 1864.) </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00192_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00192_n5"><span>Captain Samuel H. Sims

                    (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
                    brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
                    scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
                    system. He was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on the Medical Applications

                    Whitman stayed at his home in October 1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
