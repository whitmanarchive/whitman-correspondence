      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am decidedly improving—feel more like myself the last three days—I walk very clumsily yet, &amp; do not try to get around by walking—but I think I am stronger now, 
        &amp; my prospects are better than any time yet. The doctor has applied electricity again to-day, 
        making the third application—So upon the whole I think I am doing real well—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I have rec'd a letter from Priscilla Townsend—She speaks of you, says that Aunt Sally 
        always wants to hear from you—She speaks of Sarah Avery's calling there, &amp; of Mrs. Tripp, &amp; all—nothing very new—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this over at the office—It is pleasant here, but cloudy &amp; coolish—Mother, I suppose you got my letter Saturday last—How is Sister Lou getting along—when you write tell me about her—George I suppose is full of business—Well I believe it is better for a man to have plenty to do, if he is well &amp; active—Well, mamma dear, I have written you quite a rambling letter—Tell me when you want envelopes 
        &amp; I will send them—write whenever you can—I think I shall be able to soon give a good account of my improvement.
