            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am still here in the little Camden shanty not much different from when you were
                here but more disabled perhaps in locomotion power &amp; in more liability to head
                &amp; stomach troubles &amp; easiness of "catching cold" (from my compulsory staying
                in I suppose)—Mrs Davis is still housekeeping &amp;
                cooking for me—It is just past noon &amp; I am told I am to have a good rice
                pudding made in a big earthenware baking dish for my dinner—<span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh'</span>​  suits me well—(I wish you were here to help eat it)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> —I see the Staffords occasionally—Mrs S[tafford]
                was here ab't a week ago, is well as usual—nothing very new or different with
                them. They are still on the old farm &amp; store &amp; expect to continue— I
                see Ed and Harry &amp; Joe Browning occasionally—Mrs. Rogers, (Mrs S[tafford]'s sister) is dead &amp; buried, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  two weeks ago.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Thos: Eakins, portrait painter, has painted a picture of
                me—very different from yours—realistic—("a poor old blind despised
                &amp; dying King")—When you write tell me <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  your pict: whether it has been on exhibition &amp;c: also <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  the bust Mary Costelloe has— whether any
                thing has been done with it—Morse is out in Indiana
                    yet—Rhys was in Boston at last <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="accounts​ ">acc'ts</span>​  —I am writing little poetical bits for the N Y <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Herald</span>— Pearsall Smith and
                Mrs. S. &amp; Alice are going to London to live— a
                big bunch of white lilies scents the room &amp; my little canary is singing gaily as
                I finish—</p>
