                    early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
                    the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in
                        Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
                    volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
                    to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13,
                        1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
                    two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of

                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's

                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred

                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
