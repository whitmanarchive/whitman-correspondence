            <p class="tei_p">I have had a very bad cold the past week or so, but am feeling better to-day. I am at the office as usual every day. The promotion I spoke about last week hasn't come yet<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I guess I had better make no reckoning of it till it comes—Mother, I havn't received any letter from you the past week—I sent you day before yesterday a paper with the piece in (or most of it) from the London <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fortnightly Review</span>—it was meant well, but a good deal of it is most ridiculous.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Here in the office every thing goes on as usual. The Attorney General and Assistant are very busy getting themselves ready to argue their cases in the U. S. Supreme Court, which holds a session here every winter, &amp; all the big cases, in which the U. S. are a party, come off on such occasions. We are having pleasant weather yet—a little dusty though. The O'Connors are all well—they have got to move, &amp; are worrying a good deal about it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I believe that is all—so good bye for this time, mother dear. I send my love to Jeff &amp; George &amp; Mat &amp; all.</p>

                    . John Burroughs
                    called it "an eloquent article . . . but it told untruths about him. Walt said
                    it did" (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 39).
                    William O'Connor wrote to Conway on December 5, 1866: "A great deal of it I
                    liked very much, and I think the general effect of it was very good. In part of
                    it, there was a tone I regretted. Pardon me. I think the time is past when this
                    august man should be written of as a curiosity, or his poem mentioned as
                    something monstrous. You do not do this, it is true, but there are, here and
                    there, lines and touches in your article, which suggest such a treatment and
                    leave me unsatisfied" (Yale). However, to John Townsend Trowbridge, O'Connor
                    labeled it "a frightful mess of misstatement and fiction" (Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs</span> (1931), 40). Whitman, and therefore
                    his friends, objected to two of Conway's anecdotes in particular: Whitman's
                    lying on his back at Coney Island with the temperature at 100 degrees, and the
                    description of his room in 1855. In 1888 Whitman observed: "I can't help feeling
                    still a little suspicion of Conway's lack of historic veracity: he romances: he
                    has romanced about me: William says lied: but romanced will do" (Horace Traubel,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [Boston: Small, Maynard
                    &amp; Company, 1906–1996], 3:16). William Michael Rossetti repeated the
                    Coney Island tale in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Walt Whitman</span> (London: John
                    Camden Hotten, 1868), 15–16. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
