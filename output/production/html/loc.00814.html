            <p class="tei_p">I feel lately as though I must have some intermission, I feel well &amp; hearty enough, &amp; was never better, but my feelings are kept in a painful condition a great part of the time—things get worse &amp; worse, as to the amount &amp; sufferings of the sick, &amp; as I have said before, those who have to do with them are getting more &amp; more callous &amp; indifferent—Mother, when I see the common soldiers, what they go through, &amp; how every body seems to try to pick upon them, &amp; what humbug there is over them every how, even the dying soldier's money stolen from his body by some scoundrel attendant, or from some sick ones, even from under his head, which is a common thing—&amp; then the agony I see every day, I get almost frightened at the world—Mother, I will try to write more cheerfully next time—but I see so much—well, good bye for present, dear Mother—</p>
