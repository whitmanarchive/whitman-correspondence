            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Some days ago came my parcel—many thanks—Mr. Grosart's
                books included. That for Mr. Graves had come previously—I have waited a few
                days expecting to hear from my brother (from Edinburgh) of the arrival of his
                copies, but it is sometimes his way to put off writing to me too long, &amp; I have
                little doubt he has got the books safely.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Rossetti let me know from time to time any news of you that
                reached him, and I have to thank you for some newspapers now &amp; again.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It was a real sorrow to us, dear friend, to hear of the loss of your little nephew
            &amp; name–sake. A friend of mine Harold Littledale watched
                this summer by the side of a little sister (about twenty years younger than himself)
                who died, and he told me that in the presence of death &amp; with its consciousness
                enveloping him it was words of yours which expressed the deepest truths of the hour
                &amp; the event. Littledale is President this year of our principal society of students—in
                Trinity College, the Philosophical Society, &amp; I believe his Opening address,
                which is the event of the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01499.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01499.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01499.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Session, is to be partly concerned with your poetry. It was a
                great satisfaction to me this year also, to get a kind of confession or
                self–revelation from one of the most promising men in my class of the really saving
                &amp; delivering power of your writings when he was lapsing in that lethargy &amp;
                cynicism which is one of the diseases of youth in our <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Old</span>
                World, if not in your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">New</span> one—(but in both I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="should​ ">shd</span>​  suppose).</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have done too little this last summer. I copied out about 200 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="pages​ ">pp</span>​  of verse, &amp; am about to have them published. I will send you a copy,
                but I doubt whether you <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01499.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01499.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01499.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> will care for them—I don't claim to be an "Answerer"; but I
                do assert a right to be one of the tribe of the singers—"eye–singer,
                ear-singer, head–singer, sweet–singer, echo–singer, parlor–singer, love–singer, or
                something else". And these have their place &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">raison d'être</span>. Probably my next bit of work will be the
                arranging for publication a volume of Essays on 19<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span>
                century writers, including Tennyson &amp; Browning, Victor Hugo, &amp; the Westminster
                    Article (somewhat altered) on your poetry.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You asked for O'Grady's address. I don't know it at this moment;
                but he would like to get your photograph (of which you spoke) &amp; if you address it to my care he will get it.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hope the cooler weather (after so hot a summer) may do your health good. We are all
                well.</p>
