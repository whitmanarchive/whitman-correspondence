                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Pray forgive my long silence. I have been deep in troubles of my own. All the books have arrived and been safely transmitted. Many thanks.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You have doubtless heard about affairs in England. The tone adopted by certain of your friends here became so unpleasant that I requested all subscriptions etc. to be paid over to Rossetti, and received no more myself. During a certain lawsuit against the Examiner, your admirers—notably Mr. Swinburne—pleaded against me that I had praised <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span>, cited <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">your</span> words against me in court etc. I never was so shocked and astonished, for I would not have believed human beings capable of such iniquity.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As I think I told you before, I shall ever regret the insertion of certain passages in your books (Children of Adam etc). I do not believe them necessary or defensible. These passages are quoted as being the work of an immoral writer, and, altho' I tried to show they were part of a system of philosophy, it would not do. I know the purity and righteousness of your meaning, but that does not alter my regret.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I think your reputation is growing here, and I am sure it deserves to grow. But your fatal obstacle to general influence is the obnoxious passages. I wish you would make up your mind to excise them with your own hand.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">God bless you!—May your trouble lift, and may happy days be in store for you!—Let me know about your affairs. I may soon be in a position to help you more definitely.</p>

                <span class="tei_salute tei_salute_rend_right">Yours ever,</span>
