                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt Whitman:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Pray forgive my long silence.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I have been deep in troubles of my own. All the books have arrived and been safely transmitted. Many thanks.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You have doubtless heard about affairs in England. The tone adopted by certain of your friends here became so unpleasant that I requested all subscriptions etc. to be paid over to Rossetti,<a href="#n0522" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0522">2</a> and received no more myself. During a certain lawsuit against the Examiner, your admirers—notably Mr. Swinburne<a href="#n0610" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0610">3</a>—pleaded against me that I had praised <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span>, cited <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">your</span> words against me in court etc. I never was so shocked and astonished, for I would not have believed human beings capable of such iniquity.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As I think I told you before, I shall ever regret the insertion of certain passages in your books (Children of Adam<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a> etc). I do not believe them necessary or defensible. These passages are quoted as being the work of an immoral writer, and, altho' I tried to show they were part of a system of philosophy, it would not do. I know the purity and righteousness of your meaning, but that does not alter my regret.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I think your reputation is growing here, and I am sure it deserves to grow. But your fatal obstacle to general influence is the obnoxious passages. I wish you would make up your mind to excise them with your own hand.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">God bless you!—May your trouble lift, and may happy days be in store for you!—Let me know about your affairs. I may soon be in a position to help you more definitely.</p>

                    (1841–1901), a Scottish poet, novelist and dramatist, was an ardent
                    supporter of Walt Whitman's works in England (see Harold Blodgett, "Whitman and
                    Buchanan," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Literature</span>, 2:2 [May 1930],

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was one of Whitman's
                    earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake:
                        A Critical Essay</span> (1868), Swinburne pointed out similarities between
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His
                    famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs
                        before Sunrise</span> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
                    Whitman and his later recantation, see two essays by Terry L. Meyers, "<a href="https://pubs.lib.uiowa.edu/wwqr/article/id/25957/">Swinburne and Whitman: Further Evidence</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    d'Adam" in the 1860 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, this
                    cluster of poems celebrating sexuality was called "Children of Adam" in 1867 and
                    thereafter. The poems, openly "singing the phallus" and the "mystic deliria,"
                    were too bold for their time and often led to trouble for Whitman. His
                    relationship with esteemed writer Ralph Waldo Emerson cooled after he refused
                    Emerson's advice in 1860 to drop the poems; in 1865, he lost his job in the
                    Department of the Interior in Washington D.C., for writing "indecent" poems; and
                    he had to withdraw the 1881 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span> from
                    publication in Boston when the Society for the Suppression of Vice found it
                    immoral. For more on "Children of Adam" and its reception, see James E. Miller,
