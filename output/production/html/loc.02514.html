                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    by that of the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke, who had recently
                    returned from two months of travel in Europe, where he had spent time with

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    1866–?) was the brother of Warren Fritzinger, who would serve as Whitman's
                    nurse beginning in October 1889. Harry worked as an office boy in Camden when he
                    was fourteen. He also worked as a sailor. Later, he became a railroad conductor.
                    Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, took care of both Harry and Warren after the
                    death of their father, the sea captain Henry W. Fritzinger. Davis had looked
                    after Capt. Fritzinger, who went blind, before she started to perform the same
                    housekeeping services for Whitman. Harry married Rebecca Heisler on September
                    15, 1890. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
