            <p class="tei_p">Thank you for the copy of "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Once a Week</span>" 
                you sent me &amp; which I received on the 17<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> ult.—I noted especially the account of The
                O'Gorman Mahon, &amp; the pictures &amp; leader relating
                to the Indians. It reminded me of your "Indian Bureau Reminiscences," which I re-read <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01074.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01074.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01074.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I hope that your artist friend "B.H." "regained his health" &amp; has been successful in his studies
                &amp; work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you herewith a copy of "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Magazine of Art</span>" for
                January,—containing a photogravure &amp; engravings of earlier portraits of
                    Ruskin, which I think will interest you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have long been deeply interested in his books, &amp; it used to be one of my main
                desires to give <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01075.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01075.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01075.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> them
                complete &amp; exhaustive study that I, too, might contribute a little to their
                exposition &amp; support.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And I still think that no English author—since his master Carlyle—so emphatically deserves it, &amp; deserves the
                sympathetic &amp; careful study of his race. And at <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">no</span>
                period, probably, has a braver, purer spirit ever spent his passionate force in
                literature for the sacred cause of human well-being. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01076.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01076.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01076.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> His message (with whatever
                limitations,—&amp; they are great) is one of deep importance to his
                generation, &amp; should be laid well to heart. But it still needs to be set in its
                due relationship &amp; needs (it seems to me) to be corrected &amp; offset by the
                larger &amp; complementary (or rather over-arching) teaching which <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> have given us. I have long desired to attempt to do
                this. And, with better health &amp; strength, &amp; under <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01077.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01077.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01077.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> more favourable conditions, I yet hope to
                do something towards it.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I often wonder to what extent you are acquainted with his books. No doubt you know
                some of them well. They are antagonistic, of course, in several essential respects,
                to your own. But I am often struck, in minor points, with the degree in which they
                are not only in unison with yours, but in which they support &amp; illustrate them.

                been done. And though one wishes for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">his</span> sake that he
