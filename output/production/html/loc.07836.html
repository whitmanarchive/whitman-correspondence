            <p class="tei_p">All as usual with me—Sit here in the big ratan heavy-timber'd old yellow chair
                much the same as when you were here—pleasant weather (frequent
                showers)—Warry is somewhere down in the cellar
                with the wood-fuel preparations &amp; cleaning up—the massage book came safe
                (valuable book)—I have sent a 2d copy of p'k't-b'd L of G. to our friend Wallace—enclosed letters f'm Dr Bucke to me rec'd
                lately—(I just send letter to Dr B who writes me ab't twice a
                week—welcome)—Warry has just come in &amp; made the bed—A sudden
                quite heavy shower—Loving salutation to you, to Wallace &amp; to all the
                friends</p>
