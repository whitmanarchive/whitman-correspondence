                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    his letter of <a href="loc.02447">September 27, 1890</a> was overwhelming:
                    "Thanks too for the domestic details and glimpses into your daily life which you
                    favour me with, all of which possess a genuine and deep interest for me and
                    which serve to vivify and deepen the ever present and ineradicable image &amp;

                    Whitman's letter: "In the gummed envelope of this Letter there is a white hair
                    which was probably detached from the beard of Walt Whitman." On <a href="loc.04962">December 16, 1890</a> Wallace related with the sobriety
                    of his devoton that a friend had set this discovery (or revelation) to music in
                    a line reading, "[Dr. Johnston] triumphantly has shown us a hair from off your
