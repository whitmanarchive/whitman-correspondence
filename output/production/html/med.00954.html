            <p class="tei_p">Quite a neat and appropriate way of testifying the
                public gratitude to our New York Volunteers, returned from the Mexican war, has been
                carried out in this city. The Corporation have had nearly four hundred large silver
                medals, struck from an appropriate design, and have given one to each of the
                Volunteers. The medals, themselves, are very beautiful, and their intrinsic value is
                about seven dollars a piece. On one side are the words—"<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Corro Gordo, Chapultepec,
                Cherubusco, Vera Cruz</span>." And on the other—"Presented by the City of New York to the
                Volunteers of the 1st New York Regiment in Mexico."</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The first-mentioned side has
                also a device of the Genius of Liberty, with a bundle of arrows, pointing to the
                Halls of the Montezumas. The other has the arms of New York. Take it altogether,
                this is a very liberal and well-arranged testimonial, and reflects honor on "him
                that gives and him that takes." Each Volunteer, it is to be hoped, will preserve his
                gift, and transmit it as an heir loom. Of course, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">dead</span>, too, are not forgotten.
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Their</span> medals will be preserved as sacred indeed.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">We are expecting the steamer
                Crescent City here by tomorrow, or the next day, at farthest. She brings us, I see
                by the telegraphic dispatch announcing her departure, a big lot of the ready
                rhino—an article much needed hereabouts. In every point of view, the establishment
                of a line of steamers, each equal to the Crescent City, would be prodigiously
                advantageous to New York, Havana and New Orleans, all and each of them.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Every body
                here is quite disgusted with the Congress of the United States and their dawdling,
                long-drawn-out style of legislation, or rather their no legislation. What good are
                they doing at Washington? What need is there that they should stay there ten days
                longer? Indeed, if they had possessed ordinary application and industry, two months
                ago would have seen them adjourned. The plain truth is, that nearly all of them—and
                one party is just as bad as another—are busy (at the people's expense)
                electioneering and President making. The people, it seems, are not capable of
                managing this matter for themselves, and must have their "public servants" do it for
                them. Indeed, this impertinence on the part of Hon. Senators and Representatives, is
                getting to be quite unbearable. In olden times, even, when the people (at least we
                moderns say so) were not half so intelligent and well-informed as now, such
                interference wouldn't have been permitted at all; it wouldn't have been permitted,
                however, in the days of Washington, Adams and Jefferson. Politicians think
                altogether too much of themselves and their influence. As a body, they are very
                corrupt and selfish, thinking more of "spoils" than any thing else. Gloomy would it
                be for this Republic, were there not an immense body of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">middlemen</span>, uninterested in
                politics any further than to do right, or to have right done, who control political
                action. At Washington, now, nearly every member of both houses is engaged in this
                abominable game of injuring certain parties, or benefitting others—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">parties</span>, as such,
                and not connected with any national question or political measure, in which any
                human being—except politicians—is interested! It is equally true, I hope, that the
                masses of the people, are beyond the effect of these improper influences.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Evening
                before last the performances at the Chatham theatre were for the benefit of Messrs.
                Kipp &amp; Brown,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">1</a> who met with such a sweeping loss a couple of months since. The house
                was well filled, and the benefit must have been a substantial one. The pieces were
                light and lively. The Chatham, by the way, is making money at no small rate, though
                its <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">prices</span> are on the small rate.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you remember much about New York, in the way of
                what places are, and what places are not "genteel," you know that the Park, around
                the City Hall, has for years past been in the latter category. Fashion, however, is
                proverbially whimsical, and, this summer, the ban has been taken off. From sundown
                to 9 o'clock, it is decided to be unexceptionable as a promenade. Though surrounded
                with the loudest sort of clatter, it certainly is one of the most agreeable places
                in its quarter of the city for a promenade, especially considering the fountain.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">"Among the peculiar "features" of these times in New York, is the fact that more
                than half the houses and lots of the city, and of Brooklyn, Williamsburg, and the
                other suburban places, are for sale. The same may be said of the farming places
                within 60 or 100 miles of the city. We are a migratory people, that's a fact—every
                body wants to be moving—it makes no difference where, if they only move. With all
                the confusion, however, in trades, sales, etc., there seems to be very little
                evidence of real property—that is, comparatively, little, in our city. Folks appear
                gay and hearty enough, which is the true philosophy.</p>
