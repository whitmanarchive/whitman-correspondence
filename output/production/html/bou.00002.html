                me—I have just finished my early supper (I only eat two meals a day—no dinner)—mutton &amp; 
                rice broth, Graham bread &amp; a cup of tea—relish'd all—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Rush was here to-day—his imprisonment over, &amp; he goes right off to
                Concordville (is it?)—he looks well &amp; was very thankful—had your names over &amp; over again with 
                thanks &amp; blessings—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am writing for pub'n a little still—have had a bad spell last week &amp; before—one of my worst—but 
                am now ab't as usual considering <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the steady downward trend</span>—Dr Bucke 
                is well—I enclose some pictures.</p>
