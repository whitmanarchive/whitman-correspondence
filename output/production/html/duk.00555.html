                got your
            letter monday with the contents
            all safe I should have written
            before but I wanted to hear from
            Hannah and we hadent had
                any word from Jeff
                in a week
            so I thought I would wait
            I got one from Heyde yesterday
                tuesday 17th he says Han is improvin<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">g</span>
            the doctor lanced her wrist
            and it discharged very
            much he said and since he
            said she was not quite so nervious
            her wrist appears to
            have been a gathering – it must be
            on her right hand I dont wonder
            at her letter being wrote so irregular
            and she very nervous with all
            well as to Jeff he is I suppose on
            his way to Brooklyn – will be here
                probably on saturday or sunday
                
            I am glad he is coming poor jeff
            I feel sorry for him and sorry
            for matty
                and sorry for myself – 
            I have my hands full I will
            assure you Walter dear – I feel
            sometimes almost done out – then i
            get quite recruited) some days
            matty has to lie down nearly
            all day – then again she can doo
                around a little – she has been
            troubled very much with vomiting
            I think she takes some things

            at all) the doctor does all he can
            he sounded her lungs again
            on monday and said it <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">w</span>s
            no worse but if any thing rather
            better) her right lung is the one
            affected) she asked him if he
            couldent give her something
            for her coughf he said no
            that it came from her lungs
            and no medicine could cure
            it – the only thing was the way she lived and
            place she lived in) and that
            was the only thing that would
            help her) he said if she had 16
            doctors the best that could be
            produced they could not remove
            her disease by medicine) but
            if she would go where the air
            was dry she could very likely
            get better Yesterday she was

            George went to the doctors last
            night to get something he had
            had prepared for her) the doctor
            asked him if she hadent had 
            a bad day) charley heyde said
            they mentioned her case to dr Thayer
            and he said she couldent have
                come to a worse place than brooklyn</p>
