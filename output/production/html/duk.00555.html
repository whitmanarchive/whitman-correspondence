            the doctor lanced her wrist

            said she was not quite so nervious
            her wrist appears to
            have been a gathering – it must be
            on her right hand I dont wonder
            at her letter being wrote so irregular

            assure you Walter dear – I feel
            sometimes almost done out – then i
            get quite recruited) some days
            matty has to lie down nearly
            all day – then again she can doo
                around a little – she has been
            troubled very much with vomiting

                        for its systematic correction. The marks are faintly visible on the digital

                        Duke University. The corrections appear to be in Louisa's hand, but she may
                        have been prompted to make these corrections by her visiting granddaughter
                        Manahatta. (Manahatta accompanied her mother Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
                        Whitman for her return to Brooklyn for medical treatment.) It appears that
                        Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in her hand corrected her usual lowercase "i" to
                        capital "I" and made many marks to separate phrases. That said, while
                        lower-case "i" is more common in later letters, capital "I" is not unusual
                        in early letters. Also, the style of the slash to separate phrases is not
                        systematically different from the mark that is elsewhere transcribed as a
                        closing parenthesis—the style of the mark varies widely. In this
                        edition, the dashes have been transcribed as an en dash with a space before
                        and after, and the slash-style marks are transcribed as the closing
                        parenthesis.</p>
