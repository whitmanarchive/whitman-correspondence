            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I heard by William O'Connor of the St. Louis proposition<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—&amp; as far as I could judge by his
                account—&amp; since by your letter &amp; Mother's—it seems to me best
                to accept the offer, &amp; go, by all means—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is a great work—a noble position—&amp; will give you a good big field.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Jeff, I wish to hear about the family arrangements—whether Mother &amp; Martha
                &amp;c are going to stay there this summer, or not—(I hope they are.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing special with me, to write about. In the office, all goes on as
                usual. I still board at 472 M st. Love to Mat &amp; the little girls. Remember me to
                Mr. Lane<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; Davis<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—So good bye for this
                time, Jeffy, dear brother. </p>
