                <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Jeff,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I heard by William O'Connor of the St. Louis proposition—&amp; as far as I could judge by his
                account—&amp; since by your letter &amp; Mother's—it seems to me best
                to accept the offer, &amp; go, by all means—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">It is a great work—a noble position—&amp; will give you a good big field.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Jeff, I wish to hear about the family arrangements—whether Mother &amp; Martha
                &amp;c are going to stay there this summer, or not—(I hope they are.)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing special with me, to write about. In the office, all goes on as
                usual. I still board at 472 M st. Love to Mat &amp; the little girls. Remember me to
                Mr. Lane &amp; Davis—So good bye for this
                time, Jeffy, dear brother. </p>
