                    approved by Congress on June 20, 1874, required a reduction of personnel in the
                    Department of Justice. Whitman's letter was sent by Grant's secretary to the
                    Attorney General on July 26, 1874. It was accompanied by a clipping from the
                    Camden <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New Republic</span> of June 20, 1874, which included
                    "Song of the Universal" and Whitman's (anonymous) comments on his illness.
                    Wecter conjectures that Whitman had the article printed "with the hope that it
                    might catch Grant's eye more effectually than would a letter"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span>, 58 (1943), 1108. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
