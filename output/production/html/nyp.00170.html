         <p class="tei_p">Lew tells me he has just finished writing to you, and I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> take the opportunity of sending a few lines in his letter<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>, as a slight token of my affectionate regard for you. I am sorry to hear you have been ill; but hope that by this time you have fully recovered; and that we shall soon have the pleasure of seeing you in Washington, where you are so much missed by your intimate friends and the soldiers in hospitals.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am at present rather unwell;—with a billious attack—but hope to be up again in a day or two.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There was a salute of 100 guns fired here at noon today, in honor of the news from Atlanta, which creates quite a Jubilee.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is now quite a shower of rain falling, and Lew and Bartlett are having quite a time down stairs<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>, while I am up here in our room, alternately throwing up bile, and writing to you. Very interesting, is it not? (I mean the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bile</span> - ing affair.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If you have time, please write me sometimes, as I will always be very happy even to receive a few lines from you.</p>

                    (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
                    August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
                    transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
                    February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
                    February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
                    and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
                    January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
                    Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from <a href="nyp.00193">September 11, 1864</a>
                    . The following
                    September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
                    of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
                    in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
                    family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00170_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00170_n3"><span>Adrian Bartlett was a friend
                    of Joseph Harris and Lewis Brown; all three met Whitman while they were being
                    treated at Armory Square Hospital. On <a href="nyp.00167">July 18,
                        1864</a>, Brown reported that he had not seen Bartlett and Harris since
                    they returned from a spree to Baltimore on July 4, 1864. According to Brown's
                    letter of <a href="nyp.00169">September 5, 1864</a>, the three young men
                    were living in a Washington boardinghouse; Harris was not in good health, and
                    Bartlett worked in the Treasury Department. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
