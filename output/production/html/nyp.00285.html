            </span>

            <div class="section"><p class="tei_p">I received your note,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> with
                Ferdinand Freilegrath's<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> address, at Cologne. I have called on Mr. Westermann,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> who seemed to
                think, upon the whole, that the best way to reach F. F. would be to direct to him to
                care of his publisher, J. G. Cotta, at Stuttgart, Germany. I should like to make up
                a package for F. F.—but most that I want send him is there in Washington.
                Still, I may attempt it here. I will write you further about it.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am having pleasant quiet times here—am occupied a little, &amp; loafe around
                a great deal—am having fixed up, &amp; bound, (partly printed too,) the
                remainings of Leaves of Grass, edition 1867—as there are none on hand, &amp;
                there is a small demand. Am also writing &amp;c a little. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">My dear mother I find in unusual health &amp; spirits, for one of her age. We are
                moving into the new quarters—much more agreeable &amp; roomy, when settled,
                than the old ones. My brother George is well &amp; hearty. Eddy the same. Mother
                sends her love to you &amp; Nelly. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I received yesterday a kind note from Dr. Channing,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>
                offering me hospitality at Providence. I shall gladly accept—shall certainly
                make them a visit of a few days before I return to Washington. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am rooming at Mrs. Price's, but spend a great part of every day with Mother, always
                taking dinner there. The journey to &amp; fro, &amp; especially crossing the ferry,
                &amp; resuming my acquaintance with the pilots, is quite a part of my pleasure here. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I had quite an interview <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tete-a-tete</span> with John Swinton a few
                nights ago. He is much more deeply impressed with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                    Grass</span> than I had supposed—said that the more he read it, the more it imprest him with the meanness &amp; superficiality of all current literature &amp;
                journalism—went on in a strain that would have answered your &amp; John
                Burroughs's extremest demands, &amp;c.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Swinton has lately been posting himself about William Blake, his poems—has the
                new London edition of W. B. in two vols.<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> He,
                Swinton, gives me rather new information in one respect—says that the formal
                resemblance between several pieces of Blake, &amp; my pieces, is so marked that he,
                S, has, with persons that partially know me, passed them off temporarily for mine,
                &amp; read them aloud as such. He asked me pointedly whether I had not met with
                Blake's productions in my youth, &amp;c—said that Swinburne's idea of
                resemblance &amp;c was not so wild, after all. Quite funny, isn't it?<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tell John Burroughs I send him my love, &amp; I wish you to let him have an
                opportunity of reading this letter, if he desires to. Charles Eldridge the same.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Is Ashton<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> there, &amp; well—&amp; what news in the office?</p></div>

    <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly.</span></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am writing this in my room at Mrs. Prices. We had rain all last night, and now a
                rainy, cloudy, dark Sunday. I was down late to breakfast this morning—had a
                good breakfast though—nobody home but Mrs. Price &amp; Mr. Arnold<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a>—I
                like the latter more than formerly—after breakfast we sat leisurely &amp; had
                a good chat—subject, the Roman Catholic religion—anent of Mrs. Rein's
                sister &amp; adopted sister being Catholics. When I rose I said I was going up to my
                room to write to you &amp; William—there were warm expressions from
                both—Mrs. Price charged me to give her love to you, to William, &amp; to
                Jeannie—Mr. A. said "Give my love to Mrs. O'Connor, she is a woman I
                like—Mr. O'Connor I believe I have never seen." Good bye for the present,
                dear friends.</p>

                    Gregorian chant, bellowed by bull-necked priests with donkey lips, and a
                    first-class, infinitely varied, complex-melodied Italian opera, sung by voices
