            <p class="tei_p">We have had a wonderful fine day—I feel much better—had the best night's sleep last night for four weeks—Miss Hillard came at 10 this forenoon, &amp; took me over in the coupé to Philadelphia—went &amp; saw the great Dr Mitchell, I was very well pleas'd with him—I am to go again—He did not express any opinion particular—said he would tell me next time—examined my heart by auscultation—said there was nothing at all the matter with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that</span>—Then I went to Mrs Perot's &amp; we had dinner—Mrs P brought me home in the coupé—had a very good 4 or 5 hours—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Harry is up spending the afternoon with me—brought a chicken—your card to Bell &amp; letter to George came this forenoon—George has not yet got home—</p>
           
            <p class="tei_p">Lou, my old grand-aunt 97 years old in New York, Mrs Sarah Mead, died last Tuesday—I got a letter from her son-in-law Thursday—will finish this, &amp; send it off to-morrow—Sunday—</p>
            
            
            <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday afternoon—3–4 oclock—</span></p>  
            
            <p class="tei_p">George got home about dark last evening, &amp; is away up to the farm to-day—he seems all right as usual—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Bell has been to church this morning—She continues to get along excellently well—We have quite a good many callers—I am not so well to-day—my rheumatism makes itself felt nearly all the time, yet not so severe—Fine sunny weather yet—</p>
