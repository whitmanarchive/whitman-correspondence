      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">your letter has come, &amp; is welcome. Dear Abby, &amp; dear friends all, 
        the doctors say I will get well, &amp; I say so too—but which ever way it goes, 
        it will be all right—the little Philadelphia paper piece was about the right 
        statement of my case from a favorable point of view—I shall remain here 
        for the present—I get around middling well—the worst is bad spells in the head 
        which persistently return—if I get a little better I may like to come on 
        &amp; pay you a visit—upstairs will do just as well for me, as I get up &amp; down 
        better than you would think. I will write to you beforehand should I come.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">My brother Jeff has come on from St. Louis for a while—stopt here yesterday 
        though only a few hours—has gone on to N.Y. to a good sailing excursion, 
        a week on a yacht voyage—I told him to call on you, if possible—&amp; he will if he can work it—My brother &amp; sister here are well as usual—Eddy the same—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Helen, if you see Miss Hillard tell her I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  her letter &amp; thank her for it—I have not felt to write to her, or any one but my sisters, about mother's death—the great dark cloud of my life—the only staggering, staying blow &amp; trouble I have had—but <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">unspeakable</span>—my physical sickness, bad as it is, is nothing to it—</p>
