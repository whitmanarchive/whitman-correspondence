                <span class="tei_salute">My Dearest Friend:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">It seems quite a long while since I wrote, &amp; a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very long</span> while since you wrote. I am beginning to turn my thoughts Philadelphia-wards that we may have some weeks near you before we set out on fresh wanderings across the sea; and though I feel quite cheery about them, I look eagerly forward to the time beyond that when we have a fixed, final nest of our own again, where we can welcome you just when and as you please. Whichever side the Atlantic it is, you will come surely? for you belong to the one country as much as to the other. And I shall always feel that I do too. I take back with me a deep and hearty love for America—I came indeed with a good deal of that, but what I take back is different—stronger, more real. I went over to see friends in Brooklyn yesterday, &amp; it was more lovely than I can tell you on the Ferry—in fact, it was just your poem, "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry". Herby still painting away <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">con amore</span>, &amp; making good progress. I met Joaquin Miller at the Bigelows last week, &amp; he was very pleasant (which isn't always the case) and said some very good things to me. Thursday we are going to lunch with Mrs. Albert Brown—perhaps you may have heard of her as Bessie Griffiths. She was a Southern lady who, when she was about 18, freed all her slaves &amp; left herself penniless. On Sunday we take tea at Prof. Rood's of Columbia College. Kate Hillard we often see &amp; have lively chats with. We meet also &amp; see a good deal of General Edward Lee—a fine soldierly looking man, &amp; I believe he distinguished himself in the war &amp; was afterwards sent to organize the new Territory of Wyoming, &amp; was the first governor. I wish very much that if you or your brother knew him or know anything about him, you would tell me—for reasons that I will tell you by &amp; bye. Bee is seeing a great deal of the educated coloured people at Boston—was at the meeting of a literary club—the only white among 20 or 30 coloured ladies—likes them much.</p>
