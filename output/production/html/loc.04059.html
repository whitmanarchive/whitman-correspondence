            <p class="tei_p">It seems quite a long while since I wrote, &amp; a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very long</span> while since you wrote.<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">1</a> I am beginning to turn my thoughts Philadelphia-wards that we may have some weeks near you before we set out on fresh wanderings across the sea; and though I feel quite cheery about them, I look eagerly forward to the time beyond that when we have a fixed, final nest of our own again, where we can welcome you just when and as you please. Whichever side the Atlantic it is, you will come surely? for you belong to the one country as much as to the other. And I shall always feel that I do too. I take back with me a deep and hearty love for America—I came indeed with a good deal of that, but what I take back is different—stronger, more real. I went over to see friends in Brooklyn yesterday, &amp; it was more lovely than I can tell you on the Ferry—in fact, it was just your poem, "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry". Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">2</a> still painting away <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">con amore</span>, &amp; making good progress. I met Joaquin Miller<a href="#n0412" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0412">3</a> at the Bigelows last week, &amp; he was very pleasant (which isn't always the case) and said some very good things to me. Thursday we are going to lunch with Mrs. Albert Brown—perhaps you may have heard of her as Bessie Griffiths. She was a Southern lady who, when she was about 18, freed all her slaves &amp; left herself penniless. On Sunday we take tea at Prof. Rood's of Columbia College. Kate Hillard<a href="#n0302" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0302">4</a> we often see &amp; have lively chats with. We meet also &amp; see a good deal of General Edward Lee<a href="#n3008" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3008">5</a>—a fine soldierly looking man, &amp; I believe he distinguished himself in the war &amp; was afterwards sent to organize the new Territory of Wyoming, &amp; was the first governor. I wish very much that if you or your brother knew him or know anything about him, you would tell me—for reasons that I will tell you by &amp; bye. Bee<a href="#n0260" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0260">6</a> is seeing a great deal of the educated coloured people at Boston—was at the meeting of a literary club—the only white among 20 or 30 coloured ladies—likes them much.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    Cincinnatus Heine Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of
                    the Rockies" and "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness
                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
                    poetry; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), 60.
                    Whitman met Miller for the first time in 1872; he wrote of a visit with Miller
                    in a <a href="prc.00026">July 19, 1872</a>, letter to his former publisher and
                    fellow clerk Charles W. Eldridge. </span></span> [<a href="#r0412">back</a>]</li><li id="n0302">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0302 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0302"><span>Katharine Hillard (1839–1915)
                    was the translator of Dante's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Banquet</span> (1889) and the
                    editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret
                        Doctrine: A Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
                        Blavatsky</span> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Whitman's 
                    close friend, the women's rights activist Abby Price
                    (see Whitman's <a href="pml.00040">September 9, 1873</a>, letter to
                    Price). According to a letter from Whitman's mother—Louisa Van Velsor Whitman—to Helen Price
                    on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
                    Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
                    writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his <a href="duk.00657">June 23,
                        1873</a>, letter to his friend, the former publisher and fellow clerk Charles Eldridge. Hillard and Whitman first met in
                    person on February 28, 1876, and Whitman sent her a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> on July 27, 1876  (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Writing
                    to Whitman on <a href="loc.01323">September 13, 1871</a>, Moncure D.
                    Conway, who acted as Whitman's agent in England, quoted from a letter he had received 
                   from Katharine Hillard: "I have made a
                    discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that I never
                    half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed it.
                    To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
                    reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and continue
                    beyond." </span></span> [<a href="#r0302">back</a>]</li><li id="n3008">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3008 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3008"><span>Edward M. Lee was appointed

                    (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
                    attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
                    physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
