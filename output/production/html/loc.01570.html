            <p class="tei_p">I send the accompanying article<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> in hopes you can do me the favor to dispose of it to an English magazine. 
                The one I first think of is the Fortnightly Review. If not that, some other. 
                I place the whole business, price, &amp;c. in your absolute control. 
                Only understand that the piece is to be published here in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> for May. 
                Some English magazine for May is what would suit best. In haste.
