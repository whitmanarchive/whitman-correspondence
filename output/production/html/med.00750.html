            <p class="tei_p">First thank you again for the handsome money present of some months ago, wh' did me
                more good than you perhaps think for—it has helped me in meals, clothing,
                debts, &amp;c., ever since. My best help however has come in my old age &amp;
                paralysis from the Br: Islands. The piece in yr paper (was it early in May last?)
                from "a distinguished American man of letters" abt me was a very large inflation
                into fiction of a very little amt of fact—in spirit it is altogether, &amp; in
                letter mainly untrue (abt my affairs &amp;c.).<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> My income
                from my books, (royalties &amp;c.) does not reach $100 a year.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> I am now in my 69th year—living plainly but very
                comfortably in a little wooden cottage of my own, good spirits invariably, but
                physically a sad wreck, failing more and more each successive season, unable even to
                get abt the house without help—most of the time though without serious pain or
                suffering, except extreme weakness wh' I have a good deal—the paralysis that
                prostrated me after the Secession war (several shocks) never lifting entirely
                since—but leaving mentality unimpaired absolutely (thank God!) I have a few,
                very few, staunch &amp; loving friends &amp; upholders here in America. I am
                gathering a lot of pieces—uttered within the last six years &amp; shall send
                them out under the name of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> before
                long—a little book (200 pages or less) some new pieces—a sort of
                continuation or supplement. Then I think of printing a revised ed'n of complete
                writings (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days

                volume) soon. Please accept <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">personal thanks</span> from me (never mind the literary) &amp;
                I know you will accept the impromptu Note in the same spirit in wh' it is written.
                Best thanks and love to all my British helpers, readers &amp; defenders.</p>

                    (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Pall Mall Gazette</span> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
                    what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
                    would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
                    investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
                    impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
                    "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
                    readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
                    headlines. He died on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Titanic</span> when it sank in
                    1912. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00750_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00750_n1"><span>Stead had printed
                    passages from a "private letter" on May 6, which detailed the American
                    supporters of Whitman: George W. Childs, Carnegie, Burroughs. The
                    author—perhaps Moncure Conway—asserted that "a rich Philadelphian
                    told me today that he had given himself, off and on, a thousand dollars," and
                    concluded: "All this talk of the necessity of raising money by subscriptions
                    abroad, with the idea that he won't be taken care of at home, is ridiculous";
