            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Lazy me, that have been thinking letters to you instead of writing them! We have Dr. Bucke's book at last; could not succeed in buying one at
                    Trübner's—I believe they all sold
                directly—but he has sent us one. There are some things in it I prize very
                highly—namely, Helen Price's "Memoranda" and
                Thomas A. Gere's. These I like far better than any personal
                reminiscences of you I have ever read &amp; I feel much drawn to the writers of
                them. Also your letter to Mrs. Price from the Hospitals, dear Friend. That makes one
                hand-in-hand with you—then &amp; there—&amp; gives one a glimpse of a
                very beautiful friendship. But why &amp; why did Dr. Bucke set himself to counteract
                that beneficient law of nature's by which the dust tends to lay itself? And
                carefully gathering together again all the rubbish stupid or malevolent that has
                been written of you, toss it up in the air again to choke and blind or disgust as
                many as it may? What a curious piece of perversity to mistake this for candour &amp;
                a judicial spirit. Then again, how do I hate all that unmeaning, irrelevant
                clatter about what Rabelais or Shakespeare or the ancients
                &amp; their times tolerated in the way of coarseness or
                plainness of speech. As if you wanted apologizing for or could be apologized for on
                that ground! If these poems are to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">tolerated</span>, I, for one, could not tolerate
                them. If they are not the highest lesson that has yet been taught in refinement
                &amp; purity, if they do not banish all possibility of coarseness of thought &amp;
                feeling, there would be nothing to be said for them. But they do: I am as sure of
                that as of my own existence. When will men begin to understand them?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We have had pleasant glimpses of several American friends this summer—of Kate
                    Hillard for instance, who, by the bye narrowly escaped a
                bad accident just at our door—the harness broke &amp; the cab came down on the
                horse &amp; frightened him so that he bolted—struck the cab against a
                lamp-post (happily, else it would have been worse)—overturned them &amp;
                it—but when they crawled out no worse harm was done than a few cuts from the
                glass—&amp; Kate &amp; her friend behaved very pluckily, &amp; we had a
                pleasant evening together after all. Then there was Arthur Peterson, looking much as
                in the old Philadelphia days: and Emma &amp; Annie Lazarus—who, owing to some
                letters of introduction from James the novelist, have had a
                very gay time indeed—been quite lionized—and last, not least, Mr. Dalton
                Dorr, the curator of the Pennsylvania Museum in Fairmount Park—whom we all
                liked much. He is enjoying his visit here with all his heart—is a great
                enthusiast for our old Gothic Cathedrals, and for everything beautiful—but
                says there is nothing such a source of unceasing wonder &amp; delight as riding
                about London &amp; over the bridges &amp;c on the top of an omnibus watching the
                endless flow of people—it is indeed a kind of human Mississippi or Niagara.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The young folks are busy packing up to start for the seaside. Herby wants a background for a picture in which green turf &amp;
                trees and all the richness of vegetation come down to the very edge of the sea and I
                seem to remember such a place near Lynn Regis, where I was thirty years ago, when my
                eldest child was born, so they are going to look it up. We hear the heat is very
                tremendous in America this year. I hope you are as well as ever able to stand it
                &amp; enjoy it? I wonder where you are. Friendly greetings to Mr. &amp; Mrs.
                    Whitman &amp; Hattie &amp; Jessie &amp; the Staffords. Love to you, dear
                Friend, from us all.</p>

                    two.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
