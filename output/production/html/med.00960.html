            <p class="tei_p">The anticipated rising in Ireland<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> continues to engross very much of the public interest
                here, even though the political witchery of the season is fast closing its spells
                around us. Ireland has such a large representation here in New York—many of
                the most distinguished professional men, as well as a large portion of the working
                classes, looking back to Erin as their native land—more beloved, because most
                oppressed. In almost every quarter the subject of the trials of the arrested
                Repealers is talked of, and the consequences it will lead to discussed. One thing is
                beyond doubt: if the fall of 1848 passes on to winter, (which latter rigid season is
                a fitting symbol of the icy clutch which the Russell<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> government are tightening
                around Irish freedom) and the English officials go on imprisoning the glory and the
                pride of Ireland—for such are those young Repeal editors, as brave hearts as
                throb on old earth's surface!—and packing juries to convict them, and sending
                them off to the hulks, and the oppressed submit to it all, without actual resistance
                of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">deed</span>, then the sympathy of the world—at all events
                of our New World—is shorn of its proportions, and we can hardly think the
                Irish yet deserving of their freedom. We can hardly think of any worse or more
                cowardly enemies, then, than they are to themselves. As it is, the great heart of
                America and of France would be with them. Nor could it be, in case of a deadly
                struggle, that the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">honest</span> heart of Old England would willingly
                see the Government carrying fire and sword against men whose only crime is loving
                their country, and who have been pushed to desperation by untold
                persecutions—by starvation, stripes, scorn and outrages upon conscience!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Buffalo Convention<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">3</a>
                convenes next Wednesday—and a huge unwieldly meeting it will be. Delegations
                have been sent to it not by twos and tens, but by hundreds and thousands, without
                any regard to proportion or to relative sizes of places. That there will be very
                considerable excitement there, is a matter of course. Not unlikely, there will ensue
                a pretty bitter conflict of opinion between the committed friends of Mr. Van
                    Buren,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">4</a> and those who prefer somebody else. The
                probability is, however, that Van Buren will be the nominee for President, with
                Judge McLean<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> for Vice president; if not the Judge,
                Senator Hale.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">6</a> Even the New York Tribune, you see,
                endorses Van Buren. These are wonderful days, when such things come to pass!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Quite a conflict is going on between the omnibus
                proprietors and the drivers. The former have (they say in their own defence) passed
                some pretty stringent resolutions to dismiss all drivers who misbehave, or don't pay
                up every one of "them" sixpences. The worst of it is, that when one has been thus
                dismissed the other proprietors are bound not to take him into their employment.
                This don't suit the Messrs. Jehus, who number some four or five hundred of our "free
                and enlightened." So, on Sunday morning they held a grand meeting,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">7</a> and made
                speeches, and "resolved" many things—among the rest that they were an injured
                community, and wouldn't stand it; moreover, that they wouldn't work for less than a
                dollar and a half a day. Heretofore their pay has been a dollar a day.</p>

                    nationalist movement that supported Irish independence. Originating in an 1830s campaign to repeal 
                    the 1800 Irish Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland, the Young Ireland movement garnered a strong base in
                    Dublin and had a lasting influence on subsequent separatist endeavors.
                    The Young Irelanders attempted an unsuccessful insurrection in 1848, in part,
                    as a response to British Parliament's passage of a "Crime and Outrage Bill"
                    that enacted martial law in Ireland in an attempt to counter Irish nationalism. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00960_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00960_n3"><span>John Russell, 1st Earl Russell (1792–1878)
