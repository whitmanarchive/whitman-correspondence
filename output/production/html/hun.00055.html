            <p class="tei_p">Thanks, my dear E C S, for the box of noble books with the endless mines in
                them—&amp; double thanks for the loving cheering (I fear flattering) long
                letter, wh' has done me good, &amp; I have read twice—My friendly &amp;
                liberal presentation 7th Vol. is thoroughly appreciated by me—&amp; the
                picture is certainly printed at its best—The whole presentation indeed is by
                far the best of that sort I ever received. I wish to convey my best regards to the
                printers, proof-readers &amp; print-plate presser &amp;c—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been specially laid up for nearly a year almost entirely
                disabled—imprison'd in sick room—last fall &amp; during winter sometimes
                low, serious, but just now easier, comparatively free from pain—getting along
                better than you might suppose.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Our dear friend O'Connor is very ill at Washington (lower legs
                paralyzed, &amp; lately attacks of epilepsy)—Burroughs is
                pretty well—is at his place West Park Ulster Co: with his wife &amp; boy (with a book in press, I
                believe)—Best regards &amp; love to you &amp; yours—Have put off this
                letter of thanks &amp; good wishes waiting for a day I sh'd feel pretty well to
                write it in, but such day lagging I delay no longer—</p>
