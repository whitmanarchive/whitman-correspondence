                letter, wh' has done me good, &amp; I have read twice—My friendly &amp;
                liberal presentation 7th Vol. is thoroughly appreciated by me—&amp; the
                picture is certainly printed at its best—The whole presentation indeed is by
                far the best of that sort I ever received. I wish to convey my best regards to the

                low, serious, but just now easier, comparatively free from pain—getting along

                letter of thanks &amp; good wishes waiting for a day I sh'd feel pretty well to
                write it in, but such day lagging I delay no longer—</p>

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
