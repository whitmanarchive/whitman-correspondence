            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Thank you for the kind postal card—Does Wm care ab't
                having papers (Critic, Boston Trans: &amp;c) sent—&amp; is he mostly at the
                house in O street—or to be address'd at the office? I think every day about
                him, &amp; am almost feverishly anxious to do something—Would like at the
                least to send papers &amp; letters to while away the time—but fear being
                intrusive with them—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am living here in a little wooden house of my own, with a kind Jersey woman (a
                sailor's widow Mrs: Davis) for housekeeper &amp; cook—am totally bodily
                disabled as to locomotion &amp;c.—but good heart—&amp; eating,
                digestion, sleep-power &amp;c. fairly active—I am sitting here in a big arm
                chair by the open window as I write—hot weather here too for eight
                weeks—but I have stood it—</p>
