                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years, and he speaks often in his letters of their daughter Jean, by nickname
                    "Jenny" or "Jeannie." Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break in late
                    1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated black citizens,
                    Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence between Whitman and
                    Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For
                    more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see also Dashae E. Lott, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
