                    printer/compositor at 104 S. Second St. in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He
                    occasionally visited Whitman at his Camden home, and Whitman often used him to
                    set various pieces, to print stationery, envelopes, and shipping labels, and to
                    run proofs and send the poet printed slips. Whitman told Horace Traubel:
                    "Curtz—poor devil! I throw as much in his way as I can"(<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.143.html">Tuesday, November 25, 1890</a>). Another time, he described Curtz this
                    way: "Henry Curtz. You know him, Horace. He is rather an effete
                    person—seems as if left over from a very remote past: his queer little
                    office, the Washington press, the old faced letters, the wood type, Curtz
                    himself: it's all odd and attractive to me. Be good to Curtz—he's the last
                    of his race" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.52.html">Saturday, May 19, 1888</a>). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_yal.00486_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="yal.00486_n1"><span>This note was written on
