                    written on the verso of Jeff's letter of <a href="clc.00001">December 3,
                        1863</a>: "I have just telegraphed to you that Andrew was dead. Poor boy,
                    he died much easier than one would have supposed. I do hope to God you will come
                    on. I have been with him, Mary, Mother, Mat and I, almost all the time since you
                    left. Mary and I watched last night. He has been dying ever since Wednesday
                    morning—fully 24 hours—Poor Nancy, she takes it woful hard. Mary has
                    acted like the best of Women. It is very affecting to see Nancy and the
                    children. Mattie did everything that she possibly could. She watched with us
                    till near 3 o'clock this morning. Andrew was very desirous of having us all
                    around him when he died. The poor boy seemed to think that that would take
                    nearly all the horror of it
                    away." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
