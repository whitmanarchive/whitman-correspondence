                    (1823–1908) was the fourth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman and Walt
                    Whitman's youngest sister. Hannah was named for her paternal grandmother, Hannah
                    Brush Whitman (1753–1834), and her mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
                    (1795–1873). Although Walt Whitman had a close relationship with his
                    younger brother Jeff Whitman, Hannah was his favorite, most beloved sibling.
                    Until she married, Hannah lived at home with her parents and her brothers.
                    Educated at the Hempstead Academy, Hannah taught school in rural Long Island. On
                    March 23, 1852, Hannah married Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892), a
                    landscape painter. It is possible that Walt introduced Hannah to Charles. In
                    August 1852 the Heydes departed for Vermont. The first decade of their marriage
                    was marked by constant moving from boarding houses to hotels, mostly in rural
                    Vermont, as Heyde sought out vantage points for his landscape paintings. In 1864
                    the Heydes settled in Burlington, purchasing a house on Pearl Street. After
                    Hannah's marriage and relocation to Vermont, Mother Whitman became Hannah's
                    faithful correspondent; Walt also kept in touch, sending letters and editions of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after publication. Hannah faced
                    several health crises during her marriage, partly due to the ongoing trauma of
                    emotional, verbal, and physical intimate partner violence that she experienced.
                    In the 1880s and 1890s Heyde increasingly had difficulty earning enough to cover
                    household expenses; in addition, he may have become an alcoholic. He repeatedly
                    asked Whitman for funds to cover their expenses. Whitman sent both Heyde and
                    Hannah small amounts of money. After Heyde died in 1892, Hannah remained in
                    Burlington, living in their house on Pearl Street until her death in 1908. For

                    (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and
                    his brother—having lost both parents—became wards of Mary O. Davis,
                    Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
                    inherited part of his estate. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May 1891

                    month. Traubel and Ed Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase
                    "a strong suitable out-door chair" for the poet that would allow him to be
                    "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's letter to William Sloane Kennedy of
