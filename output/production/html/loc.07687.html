                                 a valiant "six hundred" who will rush into the jaws of death or into the mouth of hell.
                                 One of the outlets for these dauntless spirits has long been the quest for the North Pole.
                                 Whether its discovery is of sufficient value to science to warrant the tremendous hardships and risks to be run is 
                                 not the question. It is a fruitful field for harrowing disaster, hence its attraction to the venturous. Next year there
                                 will be another attempt made to penetrate its frozen mysteries, this time by Dr. Nansen,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">11</a> a Norwegian, whose journey
                                 across Greenland last summer will furnish interesting reading when his book, which he is writing, is finished.
                                 His plan of campaign is bold and daring. He will ascend the east coast to a higher point, if possible, than the 
                                 German and Lockwood expeditions, after crossing Greenland in its broaded part, starting from the west coast settlements.
                                 By this route, he will practically have completed the mapping of Greenland's coast line. Reaching the highest point possible
                                 on the Greenland coast, he will strike out over the frozen sea for the pole, severing all connections, and wasting no
                                 time in establishing bases of supplies. He has taken for his motto the old Norse proverb: "There is before us only heaven or hell,"
                                 and says that he expects it will be the North Pole or death. Any well-equipped expeditions have been sent into these regions,
                                 but none have gained their ends. The elaborate preparations that were made for disaster in establishing a line of retreat exhausted
                                 their energies too soon. It would seem that a flying expedition like that propsed by Nansen might penetrate farther north than the former 
                                 cumbrous ones. The scheme is backed by $100,000 capital, to which Mr. Gamel, whose name is already associated with arctic exploration, 
                                is the chief subscriber.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    Nansen (1861–1930) was a Norwegian explorer and scientist, who led the
                    first crossing of the Greenland interior in 1888. He won worldwide fame after
                    reaching a then-record northern latitude in an expedition in the 1890s, a
                    venture funded by a wealthy Copenhagen merchant named Augustin Gamel. Nansen
