            <p class="tei_p">Your card of 22d came to hand yesterday evening and has
                made me feel very bad and I should feel still worse but for the interline "am
                certainly easier" which I earnestly hope may be still true. I shall look anxiously
                for further word of you. About the Photo' that you have
                for me—thanks in advance—there is a young man going from the Asylum to
                Phila' tomorrow—he will call to see Ed. and you and he
                will bring the photo' back safe (he is coming right back) if you will give it to
                him. His name is Dick Flynn he was here in '80 and
                recollects you well and wants to see you—he will tell you about the Asylum and
                all of us. We are well and all goes well with us here—</p>
