                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
                    sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
                    caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
                    Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. Wilkins graduated on March 24,
                    1893, and then he returned to the United States to commence his practice in
                    Alexandria, Indiana. For more information, see Bert A. Thompson, "Edward

                    longtime assistant to Bucke at the London asylum, doing odd jobs. Whitman met
                    Flynn and admired his gardening work when he visited Bucke in 1880; he mentions
                    Flynn in his <a href="yal.00114">October 14, 1880</a>, letter to Thomas
                    Nicholson. Traubel also records that Whitman was anticipating a visit from Flynn
                    in Camden shortly before Bucke wrote this letter (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.142.html">Tuesday, August 27, 1889</a>). Flynn, while on a tour of the U.S.,
                    apparently stopped by Whitman's Mickle Street home and carried a copy of the
                    Gutekunst photograph of 1889 back to London with him. Whitman had worried that
                    the photo would get damaged in the mail. Whitman and Bucke both greatly admired
                    this <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/zzz.00113.html">photographic portrait</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
