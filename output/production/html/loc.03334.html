                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Walt Whitman,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your card was welcomed the other day; but I was sorry it did not give a better
                account of your present condition. I hope the bright American autumn weather will
                serve you better than the summer has done,—bringing a renascence of the
                imagination at least.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If in imagination you could only come to this Welsh mountain valley, &amp; go
                exploring some of its mountain sides &amp; its swift streams with me in this
                splendid October sunshine,—this alone would be a sufficient 
                    medecine
                    medicine
                 for the soul surely! I suppose these late weeks here have been the
                happiest of my life,—in the sense of physical delight at any rate; &amp; the
                keen pure air makes one mentally alert &amp; energetic too. A good <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03334.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03334.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03334.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> part of every
                day goes in excursions across the mountains, but I usually write in the mornings
                &amp; evenings—of necessity, &amp; so get through a fair amount of work.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The life of the farm, which you know so well in the States, is essentially the same
                here no doubt. Harvest is late this year, &amp; on some farms the corn is not yet
                all gathered in; but here at Blaen Sawdde, the two energetic sons of the house
                working under the shrewd &amp; restless direction of their father, the last field
                was stacked ten days or more ago. Old William Williams, the father, is a typical
                Welsh peasant of the better class. He is just seventy years old, &amp; except for
                indigestion &amp; occasional rheumatism, is very hale &amp; strong for his age, as I
                found out one day soon after coming here, when he took up the hatchet to show me how
                to chop a log of wood in two. Of the two sons now at home, the eldest David is about
                34 years old, &amp; William about 25.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03334.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03334.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03334.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">Like most Welshmen, they are both good <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">singer's​ </span><span class="tei_corr">singers​
        
      </span></span>, &amp; take bass in the parish church
                on Sundays. William moreover is a remarkably comely &amp; well-built youth, without
                an evil trick in his whole nature. It is really inspiring to see him at work: he
                does everything with such ease &amp; strength. And he is equally quick mentally, and
                reads English &amp; Welsh readily &amp; with imagination. I almost envy him his
                self-reliance &amp; manly sufficiency.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Two days ago quite a momentous event,—the bi-annual sale by auction of sheep,
                cattle &amp; mountain ponies, took place at the farm, &amp; some hundreds of farmers
                rode across the mountains &amp; from the surrounding hamlets to attend it. The sight
                of so many sturdy countrymen, with their ponies &amp; beautiful collie dogs, would
                have delighted you greatly. A plentiful supply of Welsh ale &amp; beef &amp; mutton
                &amp; other things made a feast quite Baronial, &amp; put them all into good humour.
                In the evening the younger fellows wrestled on <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03334.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03334.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03334.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the grass until the new moon sank 
                behind the hills &amp; it was too dark to see any longer. Later they sat round the
                fire, &amp; sang &amp; told stories,—all in Welsh of course, &amp; some score
                or more of them did not return home, but stayed here &amp; sat up all night,
                continuing the fun. Altogether a fine experience for me, as you may imagine. Every
                day I gather in this way some new association to add to my store; &amp; all the
                while I am picking up the Welsh idiom, difficult as it is, &amp; hope in a month or
                two to be able to read the old Welsh MSS. poetry &amp; romances chiefly at the
                British Museum.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to think that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">November Boughs</span> &amp; the complete
                900 page volume are so nearly ready, &amp; look forward to having them. It is within
                the bounds of possibility that I may write a review of the complete book for one of
                our leading monthlies,—the XIXth Century or Fortnightly Review; but I must not be too sure.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If Gilchrist is with you, give him greetings. &amp; Mrs. Davis too.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">

            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">I shall probably stay here two or three weeks more, &amp; then go to London after
                    a short stay in the Vale of Avallon in Somerset.</p>
