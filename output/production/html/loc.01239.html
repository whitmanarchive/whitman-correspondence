                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> I had yours of 3 Aug—acknowledging receipt of
                draft. Sorry to hear you were troubled with sunstroke. I hope you are going on
                pretty well again now. We were very pleased that the money came in handy—I
                haven't been in London lately or seen Mrs. Gilchrist or <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr.</span>​  friend Mary (?) <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Whittall​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Whitall​
        
      </span></span> whom you mention. I
                rather expect to be that way in about a month or so. Am laid up just now with a kick
                from my horse—luckily nothing very bad—he struck me (accidentally in <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01239.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01239.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01239.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> a way—the
                kick being probably meant for another horse that was teasing him) just above the
                knee on the front of the thigh—so no bones broken, but it is a big bruise and
                it will be a week or two before I can get about. It is wonderful though how nature
                sets to work directly to put things right, and it has been peaceable &amp; free from
                pain. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have plenty to do looking over proofs—I am bringing out a 2<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">nd</span> edition, enlarged, of Towards Democracy—also a
                criticism of Modern Science <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh.</span>​  I am interested in &amp; hope it will provoke some discussion—it is
                a direct attack on the validity of scientific <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01239.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01239.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01239.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 'laws' &amp; methods
                generally—not that I don't think Science has been very useful, but that it is
                time that it should 'climb down' a bit. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Do you see anything of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr</span>​  young friend McKinsey or has he left Philadelphia? I send you
                a photo I had taken a little time ago with a young fellow who is an old friend of
                mine—in Sheffield—it is not very good of me, though very fair of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="the other​ ">'tother</span>​  one. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> The farm gets on—slowly—but still it moves, and I rather expect in a few
                months to put it on a distinct cooperative footing. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> Prices are awfully low—owing apparently to the general depression and the fact
                that the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mass of the people</span> are without money—also
                perhaps, partly to a growing scarcity of gold. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Isabella Ford has had an accident since we wrote, but I do not know exact particulars.
                She was driving with her Mother &amp; the ponies ran away— Isabella climbed out,
                probably thinking she <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="could​ ">cd</span>​  render some assistance, &amp; fell, hurting her
                shoulder. However, she was much better when I last heard. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Hope you keep going pretty well—I often think of you &amp; wish we could have
                a chat. </p>
