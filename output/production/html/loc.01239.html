            <p class="tei_p"> I had yours of 3 Aug<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—acknowledging receipt of
                draft. Sorry to hear you were troubled with sunstroke. I hope you are going on
                pretty well again now. We were very pleased that the money came in handy—I
                haven't been in London lately or seen Mrs. Gilchrist<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">2</a> or <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr.</span>​  friend Mary (?) <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Whittall​ </span></span><a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> whom you mention. I
                rather expect to be that way in about a month or so. Am laid up just now with a kick
                from my horse—luckily nothing very bad—he struck me (accidentally in <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01239.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01239.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01239.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01239.002_large.jpg</span> a way—the

                knee on the front of the thigh—so no bones broken, but it is a big bruise and
                it will be a week or two before I can get about. It is wonderful though how nature
                sets to work directly to put things right, and it has been peaceable &amp; free from
                pain. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> Do you see anything of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr</span>​  young friend McKinsey<a href="#n3106" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3106">4</a> or has he left Philadelphia? I send you
                a photo I had taken a little time ago with a young fellow who is an old friend of

                perhaps, partly to a growing scarcity of gold. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Isabella Ford<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> has had an accident since we wrote, but I do not know exact particulars.
                She was driving with her Mother &amp; the ponies ran away— Isabella climbed out,

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
