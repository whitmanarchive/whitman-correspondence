                    Curtis in a letter from <a href="loc.00801">October 28, 1863</a>
                    , Caleb Babbitt
                    suffered a sun stroke in July 1863 and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
                    According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
                    been in Mobile earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on furlough. On
                    August 18, 1863, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre,
                    Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary
                    acknowledged Whitman's letter on September 6, 1863, and wrote that Caleb was
                    "not quite as well as when I wrote you before . . . he wishes me to tell you to
                    keep writing . . . for your letters do him more good than a great deal of
                    medicine." On September 18, 1863, at the expiration of his forty-day furlough,
                    Caleb was strong enough to write: "Walt—In your letters you wish me to
                    imagine you talking with me when I read them, well I do, and it does very well
                    to think about, but it is nothing compared with the original." On October 1,
                    1863, Babbitt was depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my pathway
                    and I can not remove them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned
                    his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved me." On October 26, 1863, S. H.
                    Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He Is
                    unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable pain In his head" (Henry W. and
                    Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library). See also Whitman's letters
                    from <a href="med.00304">December 27, 1863</a>
                    , and <a href="med.00305">February 8, 1864</a>
                    . (This letter is in
                    two pieces, on the verso of which appears the draft letter to Bethuel Smith from
                        <a href="loc.00787">7 October 1863</a>.) </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
