                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p"> William and I are here at Dr. Channing's home. I brought William out here from Washington in the
                hope that the climate might arrest the progress of his disease. It was a serious
                undertaking to bring so sick a man three thousand miles on a railroad train, and he
                was much exhausted when he arrived. He has hardly recovered from the effect of the
                journey as yet. In fact, he is worse that he has ever been. Can walk very little
                without the assistance of a friendly arm. If any improvement is to be achieved, it
                must come hereafter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> This is a garden of fruit and flowers. . . .</p>

            <p class="tei_p">William and I received here (forwarded from Washington) letters from Mr.
                    Lovering, M.C., relative to your hospital services. William
                was unable to answer, much to his regret, but I did the best I could on my own
                account. Hope for a favorable result. . . . </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> He [O'Connor] has received an indefinite leave of absence from the Treasury
                Department with pay. He says he will write you as soon as he can. He sends much
                love, and so do I. Sorry to hear from the newspapers that your health is so feeble.
                Wish you could come out here and get strong. </p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">As ever, faithfully yours</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">Charles W. Eldridge</span>
