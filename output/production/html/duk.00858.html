            <p class="tei_p">I am ab't as usual—have just had my dinner, a slice of cold roast beef, &amp; a
                couple of cook'd apples wh' I ate with relish—Dr Bucke
                has been here for a week—leaves this evening—H[erbert] G[ilchrist] is here—leaves 21st on the Germani[a]. Nothing very new
                with me in literary matters—or anent—I sent a little poem to
                Harpers—(Alden)—but it came back, refused—this is the 4th refusal within a few months, &amp; I shall try no more.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Phila: is all alive with the Centennial U S Constitutional commemoration, &amp; will
                be thro' the week—I have been pressingly invited, but cannot go—(A crowd &amp; hubbub are no place for
                me)—Fine weather here for several weeks—cloudy &amp; rainy this week,
                however—I enclose J A Symonds's note—(rather flat
                it seems to me)—also something ab't Ruskin—How ab't
                the W W Society? Anything new? Yes, I shall send you a copy of English ed'n "Spec:
                    Days"—</p>
