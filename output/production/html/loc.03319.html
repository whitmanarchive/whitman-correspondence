            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Back here again last night—after a fine time of it at Mrs. Nordhoff's, where everyone was so kind &amp; the fun so continued all day long, that I did not find time to write you even a line.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">There were some jolly young fellows there, &amp; some splendid girls, but among the last 
                I think Alys Smith may be said to have "taken the cake." Dressed as Portia, when a Shakespeare masquerade (in which everyone took some part from the plays) was being enacted, it would have delighted your eyes to see her dance,—"A wild Bacchante passionate of foot!"—The house itself stands on the Palisades of the Hudson, about 500 feet or so above 
                the river on a steep cliff, commanding a superb view right over to the sea &amp; far away up &amp; down the Hudson. The place <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_es">would</span>

            have thoroughly suited you for a camping spot.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Passing through New York yesterday, in a bright, splendid sunlight, the rush of life in Broadway made me wish you could have been with me there.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">After the stupid, half-&amp;-half pretence of Philadelphia, the reckless, go-ahead life in New York is very refreshing. Tell this not to the Philadelphians!</p>                
            <p class="tei_p">No letters arrived at Alpine Bergen for me,—so I suppose none have reached you! If there are any waiting now, will you mail them on here. I expect to go to Boston on Friday or Saturday—after which my address will be to the care of Kennedy at Belmont.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are feeling well these bright days. I am trying to persuade myself that from this New Year forward everything is to be first-rate with me &amp; with all my friends—in the higher, eternal sense, if not always &amp; altogether in the other!</p>
