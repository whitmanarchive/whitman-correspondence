Dressed as Portia, when a Shakespeare masquerade (in which everyone took some part from the plays) was being enacted, it would have delighted your eyes to see her dance,—"A wild Bacchante passionate of foot!"—The house itself stands on the Palisades of the Hudson, about 500 feet or so above 
                the river on a steep cliff, commanding a superb view right over to the sea &amp; far away up &amp; down the Hudson. The place <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_es">would</span>

I expect to go to Boston on Friday or Saturday—after which my address will be to the care of Kennedy<a href="#n3039" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3039">3</a> at Belmont.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are feeling well these bright days. I am trying to persuade myself that from this New Year forward everything is to be first-rate with me &amp; with all my friends—in the higher, eternal sense, if not always &amp; altogether in the other!</p>

                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
