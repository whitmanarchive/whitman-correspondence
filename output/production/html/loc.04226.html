                to do good and to do justice. I would like to review your late works. I would not ask a press copy
                were I able to buy them. I am certain if you will send me one or more of your late books I can by review
                and personal attention and effort return more than value received. I have often given personal mention
                of yourself and books, and will continue to do so. It would be a very great pleasure to receive from you
                a personal copy of such books as you would care to send. You have grown in favor with our students and
                readers. Your courage, high honor, fidelity and faith in justice is being rewarded by all

                    (1855–1940) was an educator, editor, and a founding member of the Woodland
                    Shakespeare Club. Thomas was a native of La Plata, Missouri, and, in 1877,
                    received a Bachelor of Philosophic Didactics from the North Missouri Normal
                    School (now Truman University) and was valedictorian of her class. She married
                    Charles W. Thomas, a lawyer originally from Kentucky, in 1879, the same year he
                    was admitted to the bar. A wedding announcement in a local newspaper describes
                    her as "one of La Plata's most accomplished, intelligent, and refined ladies"
                        (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">La Plata Home Press</span> [May 10 1879], 4). She received
                    a Master of Arts and of Philosophic Didactics from North Missouri Normal School
                    the following year. The couple moved to Woodland, California, in 1885 and
                    remained there for the rest of their lives. In an article on "The Function of
                    the Reviewer" for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Woodland Democrat</span>, Serelda Thomas
                    writes, "to think over the great thoughts after great minds is to be well-read.
                    It is also the province of the critic or reviewer to direct readers to these
                    rich, immortal fields" (reprinted in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span> no. 307
                    [November 16 1889], 247). For more information, see her obituary, "Mrs. S. G.
                    Thomas Dies in Woodland," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Sacramento Bee</span> (December
                    18, 1940), 9. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.04226_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.04226_n1"><span>Thomas wrote this letter to
                    Whitman on the back of a typed form letter written on the letterhead of a

                    form letter, signed by Thomas, is a general appeal to publishers, printers, and
                    editors to send copies of recently published books and information about the
                    histories of publishing houses. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
