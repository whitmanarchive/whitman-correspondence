            <p class="tei_p">I hope you will not consider this impertinent, or improper. The intention is good, and the purpose
                to do good and to do justice. I would like to review your late works. I would not ask a press copy
                were I able to buy them. I am certain if you will send me one or more of your late books I can by review
                and personal attention and effort return more than value received. I have often given personal mention
                of yourself and books, and will continue to do so. It would be a very great pleasure to receive from you
                a personal copy of such books as you would care to send. You have grown in favor with our students and
                readers. Your courage, high honor, fidelity and faith in justice is being rewarded by all
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">real</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">worthy</span> students. Will you let me have a word
                from you. I hope my letter will be received in the spirit in which it is sent.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Address all in my name.</p>
