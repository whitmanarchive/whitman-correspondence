            <p class="tei_p">Am still holding on—same place Mickle Street—not writing any
               for publication—suppose you rec'd my last little book "Good–Bye my
               Fancy"—J W Wallace of Bolton, Eng: is 
                here—Dr Bucke is well &amp; busy,
                same position, Canada—Harry Stafford &amp; all the S's are as before—Herbert
               Gilchrist is at his place in Centreport, well—I have a bad complication
               of gastric, bladder &amp; catarrhal maladies.</p>
