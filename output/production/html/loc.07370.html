                    (1815–1900) was a suffragist and abolitionist who later founded the
                    Detroit Women's Club. She married Augustus Wright Leggett (1836–1855), and
                    the couple's home was a stop on the Underground Railroad. Leggett, who was also
                    the grandmother of the artist Percy Ives, corresponded sporadically with Whitman
                    from 1880 until his death. A number of her letters to him are reprinted in
                    Thomas Donaldson's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: The Man</span> (New York:
                    Francis P. Harper, 1896), 239–48. For more information on Leggett, see

                    Elias Hicks (1748–1830), a Quaker from Long Island whose controversial
                    teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division
                    that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father
                    and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's
                    teachings. This letter excerpt begins Whitman's "Reminiscence of Elias Hicks" in
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span>, where Whitman writes that accompanying
                    Leggett's letter was "a rare old engraved head of Elias Hicks, (from a portrait
                    in oil by Henry Inman, painted for J. V. S., must have been 60 years or more
                    ago, in New York)." For more on Hicks and his influence on Whitman, see David S.
                    Reynolds, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's America</span> (New York: Knopf, 1995),
                    37–39. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
