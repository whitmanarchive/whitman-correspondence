            <p class="tei_p">Such a joyful surprise was that last paper you sent me, with the Poem 
                celebrating the great events in Spain—the new hopes, the new life wakening in the 
                hearts 
                of that fine People which has slumbered so long weighed down &amp; tormented with hideous nightmares of

                superstition.—Are you indeed getting strong &amp; well again? 
                able to drink in draughts of pleasure from the sights 
                &amp; sounds &amp; perfumes of this delicious time, "lilac-time"—according to your wont? 
                Sleeping well—eating well, dear Friend?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William Rossetti is comin to see me Thursday, before starting for his holiday trip to Naples. 
                His father was a Neapolitan, who 
                 
                narrowly escaped a lifelong dungeon

                for having written some patriotic Songs—he fled in disguise by help of English friends &amp; 
                spent the rest of his 
                life here. So this, his first visit to Naples, will be specially full of interest &amp; delight 
                to our friend. He is also 
                in great spirits at having discovered a large number of hitherto unknown early letters of 
                Shelley's. Of modern English Poets Shelley is the one he loves &amp;
                admires incomparably the most.—Perhaps this letter will

                on your birthday. What can I send you? What can I tell you but the same old story of a heart 
                fast anchored—of a soul 
                to whom your soul is as the sun &amp; the fresh, sweet air, and the nourishing, 
                sustaining earth wherein the other one 
                breathes free &amp; feeds &amp; expands &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">delights</span> itself.
                There is no occupation of the day however homely that is not 
                coloured, elevated, made more cheerful to me by thought of you &amp; by thoughts you have

                No hope or aim or practical endeavour for my dear children that has not taken a higher 
                larger more joyous scope through you. No immortal aspiration, no thoughts of what lies beyond death but 
                centre in you. And in 
                moods of pain and discouragement dear Friend I turn to that Poem beginning "Whoever you are holding me
                now in hand" 
                and I don't know but that that one revives &amp; strengthens

                me more than any. For there is not a line nor a word in it at which my spirit does not rise up instinctive and fearlessly 
                say—So be it. And then I read other Poems &amp; drink in the draught that I know is for me, because it is for all—the 
                love that you give me on the broad ground of my humanity and womanhood. And I understand the reality &amp;

                preciousness of that. Then I say to myself Souls are not made to be frustrated—to have their greatest &amp; best &amp; 
                sweetest impulses and aspirations &amp; yearnings made abortive. Therefore we shall not be "carried diverse" forever. This dumb 
                soul of mine will not always remain hidden from you—but some way will be given me for this love, this passion of gratitude, 
                this set of all the nerves of my being toward you, to bring joy 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00137.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_cb.00137.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_cb.00137.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                &amp; comfort to you. I do not ask the When or the How.— </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall be thinking of your great &amp; dear Mother in her beautiful old age, too, on your
