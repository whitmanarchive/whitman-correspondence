            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">I believe you told me sometime ago that you had a friend at Los Angeles, Cal. 
                If you have, I wish you would give me a line of introduction to
                him for my brother Bertie (Albert)<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">1</a> who has just left hospital after a month's
                illness with typhoid fever, and who at such a distance from home and friends feels
                (I'm afraid) homesick and possibly despondent. If I had known earlier I would have
                gone on to Los Angeles myself, to nurse the lad; but this seems unnecessary now that
                he is able to get about again. You will easily understand, however, that I feel
                pretty anxious, and if you can let me have a line as I suggest, it will be a great
                help.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Down here I've been talking again about the New Poetry—on Monday in Boston, and
                last night before the Harvard students who gave me a very hearty reception—the
                best I've had so far. I find there is quite an earnest feeling for Leaves of Grass
                among a great many of them. You have no doubt got their invitation to lecture<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> by
                this time—which I told you sometime ago they were preparing to send.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Next week (as you will see by my enclosed circular) I am to speak in Chickering Hall<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a>
                on Literary London—rather a rash adventure, I'm afraid.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Has Dr. Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">4</a> returned yet? I must write and ask him whether he
                can arrange a talk at London, Ontario, or not.</p>

                <span class="tei_salute">With remembrances to Mrs. Davis.<a href="#n6113" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6113">5</a> Yours

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
