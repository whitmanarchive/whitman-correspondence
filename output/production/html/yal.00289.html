            <p class="tei_p">I have had the two enclosed letters and your note to
                Kennedy and myself of 18th inst somedays, been too busy to
                write even a line, have never been so crowded with work of all kinds as I am at
                present. I do wish you were well enough to accept Mr. Fords proposition to go to
                England &amp; Scotland. I am dead sure you would have the biggest kind of a time and
                lots of money (if wanted) might be made out of it. But I suppose it is no use
                thinking of such a thing. O'Connor's letter is not cheerful but
                for all that middling for him poor fellow, his writing is I think better than it has
                been, firm &amp; clear—if he <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">could</span> only get better!
                But we must not wait for it.</p>
