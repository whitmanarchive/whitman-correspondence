      <p class="tei_p">I send herewith the copy of my American Institute Poem. It will be plain sailing, if you
        have a careful printer &amp; proof reader.<a href="#n0512" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0512">1</a> I think an ordinary
        12 mo would be best, and send you a sample, my idea of size of page, and sort of
        pamphlet-volume to be made. As to size of type for the poem, if English solid would not be
        too large, I would like to have that. If you think it too large, take the next smaller size.
        In binding let the edges remain uncut, &amp; bind in the kind of paper according to sample.
        See sample of title on cover. Send the revised proofs to me by mail, directed to this city,
        and I will promptly return them. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My percentage &amp;c. I leave to you to fix—I should expect two or three dozen
        copies. I reserve the copyright to myself. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the papers have freely printed &amp; criticized the piece will much help, as it awakes
        interest &amp; curiosity, &amp; many will want to have it in good form to keep. The demand
        will grow. I have no authority to speak for them, but I think the American Institute will
        want several hundred copies, &amp; that the pamphlet will have a sale at all their public
        Exhibitions &amp; Fairs. They always have book stands at them. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">It ought to be put in hand immediately, &amp; out soon. </p>

                    Boston in 1863. Though it introduced such authors as Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
                    William Morris, Joaquin Miller, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Emily
                    Dickinson, it became famous for the works of Louisa May Alcott. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">After All, Not to Create Only</span> was the only work of Walt
                    Whitman that the firm published. It has been suggested that Bronson Alcott
                    persuaded Roberts to undertake the work; see Raymond L. Kilgour, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Messrs. Roberts Brothers, Publishers</span> (1952), 107. The
