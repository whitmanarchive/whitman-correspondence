      <p class="tei_p">I send herewith the copy of my American Institute Poem. It will be plain sailing, if you
        have a careful printer &amp; proof reader. I think an ordinary
        12 mo would be best, and send you a sample, my idea of size of page, and sort of
        pamphlet-volume to be made. As to size of type for the poem, if English solid would not be
        too large, I would like to have that. If you think it too large, take the next smaller size.
        In binding let the edges remain uncut, &amp; bind in the kind of paper according to sample.
        See sample of title on cover. Send the revised proofs to me by mail, directed to this city,
        and I will promptly return them. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">My percentage &amp;c. I leave to you to fix—I should expect two or three dozen
        copies. I reserve the copyright to myself. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">That the papers have freely printed &amp; criticized the piece will much help, as it awakes
        interest &amp; curiosity, &amp; many will want to have it in good form to keep. The demand
        will grow. I have no authority to speak for them, but I think the American Institute will
        want several hundred copies, &amp; that the pamphlet will have a sale at all their public
        Exhibitions &amp; Fairs. They always have book stands at them. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">It ought to be put in hand immediately, &amp; out soon. </p>
