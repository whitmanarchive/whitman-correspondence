                also no worse—I am glad to hear of your driving in the open air, &amp; am sure you will derive

                called here &amp; I accompanied him part way home to Rivington. Cool evening, but air deliciously 
                fresh, sweet, tonic &amp; bracing. Beautiful sky &amp; cloud effects,

            <p class="tei_p">Quite a cold wind though all day, but fresh &amp; tonic.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Had a good time on Sunday evening. Bright warm sunshine, clear atmosphere &amp; a wonderful sky. 
                Got up into the fields above Rivington (alone) commanding a wide view seaward (westward). 
                Had L. of G. with me &amp; read most of the "Song of Myself," carefully &amp; studiously. Cattle 
                grazing near, every influence sweet, sanative, &amp; beautiful beyond expression.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Last night was almost equally beautiful, but colder, with strongish wind. I had a walk again round 
                the nearest lake—L. of G. as usual my companion.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J. is expecting an assistant<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">5</a> soon, &amp; I hope that he will be able

            <p class="tei_p">Some of the friends were here on Saturday,—D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J amongst them. But

                a better acceptance than has come. How stupid it was of me not to see that they were your own! I 
                supposed them to be written by friends in sympathy with you, &amp; was astonished by their powerful

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military

                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
