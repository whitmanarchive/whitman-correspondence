               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Much to our joy and surprise George made his appearance among us on Sunday morning. He arrived home about 11 O<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ck</span> on Saturday night but we all happened to be abed and he did not wake us up but went to his room and made himself shown at about 8<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">
                  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ock</span>
               </span> in the morning  He is well and looking first rate, pretty well played out as regards cloths, but we will fix him up in that respect this afternoon  He wants me to ask you if you can find out if he can get his pay in New York and if so at what office and hour. Please find out what you can about it and answer me at once. He has some $500 coming to him and would like to get it here if he can. Please write me at once will you Walt.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Of course we were all wonderfully glad to see him. I think he looks well. He certainly is well pleased with his position and I think it would be hard to get him to leave it. He could only get 10 days and that will hardly be time for him to see and shake hands with all his friends. 'Tis a pity it could not have been for 20 or 30 days, it certainly ought to have been.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all in our usual good health. Mother, George says looks younger than when he went away. I think she looks better than when you left. Mattie, Sis and the rest are all well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I received a long letter from you Saturday. I like much to hear from you   you must write often. About your office hunting  I suppose you will have to wait a long time before it amounts to anything but patience will bring something undoubtedly</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hoping to hear from you immediately, I remain</p>
            <span class="tei_closer tei_closer_rend_right">
               <span class="tei_signed">yours affectionately Jeff.</span>
