         <p class="tei_p">Yes, I shall, unless prevented, bring out a volume this summer, partly as my
            contribution to our National Centennial. It is to be called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two

            emanating the real and ideal), it will embody much that I had previously written. . . .
            but about one-third, as I guess, that is fresh. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
               Grass</span>, proper, will remain as it is identically. The new volume will have nearly
            or quite as much matter as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">L. of G.</span> (It is a sort of omnibus
            in which I have packed all the belated ones since the outset of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>.)</p>

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    The article began: "Walt Whitman writes to a correspondent...." However, see the

                    Edward Dowden of <a href="inu.00001">May 2, 1875</a>. Whitman probably
                    used similar phraseology in two letters, one written on May 2 to Dowden and
                    another written about the same time to Rossetti. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
