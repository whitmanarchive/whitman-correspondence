         <p class="tei_p">Yes, I shall, unless prevented, bring out a volume this summer, partly as my
            contribution to our National Centennial. It is to be called <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two
               Rivulets</span> (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">i.e.</span>, two flowing chains of prose and verse,
            emanating the real and ideal), it will embody much that I had previously written. . . .
            but about one-third, as I guess, that is fresh. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
               Grass</span>, proper, will remain as it is identically. The new volume will have nearly
            or quite as much matter as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">L. of G.</span> (It is a sort of omnibus
            in which I have packed all the belated ones since the outset of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>.)</p>
