            be much better it is nearly
            well now) well we have
            had our dinner not turkeys
            nor geese but pot pie
            made of mutton matty
            and hattie
                and all took
            dinner down here and
            supper last night so you
            see i donteat up stairs
            very often but i feel just
            as well satisfied) you
            know they wont have Jess
            up stairs now so we have
            the benefit of the children
            down stairs
            i dont mind
                the baby but i really
            think hattie is the worst
            child i ever had any
            thing to doo with so very
            ugly with her mischiev<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ing</span>

            if i can pay a little
            more rent and can get
            a place i shall move
            in the spring this place
            is cheap but it is too muc<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">h</span>

            she has got or had 30 doll<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ar</span>
            and the man that got the
            chest says he will set it
            up again and give her
            the proceeds
            
            they are going
            to get her a sewing mashine
            but i think it will doobut little
            good) i got your letter
            walt about Jesse Jeffy
            must have wrote very strong
            about him
                Dr ruggles is
            very much interested in him
            wel walt jessy is a very
            great trouble to me to 
            be sure and dont apprece<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">at</span>e
            what i doo for him but he
            is no more deranged than
            he has been for the last 3 years
            i think it would be very
            bad for him to be put in
            the lunatic assiliym if he
            had some light employment
            but that seems hard to get
            i could not find it in my heart to put him there withou<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">t</span>
            i see something that would
            make it usafe for me too have him

            he is very passionate
            almost to frenzy and
            always was but of cour<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">se</span>
            his brain is very weak
            but at the time of his
            last blow out we had
            every thing to confuse and
            irritate we had nanc s
            children here 2 days and
            hatty and his going there
            and seeing Andrew
            lie dead
            he cried very
            much every time he heard
            them speak of him whe<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">re</span>
            or at the funeral i fixed
            him all up and he kept

            nancy got in the carriage
            and then he brougth him
            out to her and got in the
            carriage i went in the
            carriage with her and
            Jeff and matty and Eddy
            in the next) i think Walt
            what a poor unfortunate
