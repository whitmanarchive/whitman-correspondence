            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Here I linger along like a dead wither'd tree yet ("why cumbereth it the
                    ground?")—not much different but steadily
                declining—yet spirits middling fair—&amp; appetite &amp; sleep
                fair—wh' is all something to be thankful for. If I were able how I sh'd like
                to come down there &amp; be with you all—I often think ab't you all &amp; ab't
                old times over at the Creek—Debby was here yesterday, &amp; she &amp; the
                little girl were welcome &amp; cheer'd me up—what a sweet little rose bush she
                is!—(She reminds me in her looks of Jo, &amp; then
                of her grandfather Geo:)—Susan, thank you for the nice chicken—I enjoy'd
                the eating of it well—I am sitting here in my den alone as usual—the sun
                is shining finely &amp; I shall probably get out in my wheel chair for an hour. Love
                to Harry and Ed and all—&amp; a
                happy year 1890 &amp; God's blessing to all of you—</p>
