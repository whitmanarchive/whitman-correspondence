            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter and I do not think you can form an idea how very badly I feel to hear that you are not recovering faster.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I do so sincerely hope that you are right in your theory that the slow recovery indicates permanency—I hope to God, my dear Brother that you may permanently recover—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Not much new with me—I have had several outside jobs lately that will pay me I think in time but so far they are only sources of investment</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How do you get along on money matters? do not fail to let me know if you have any prospect of being short  I read with much regret mother's statement about the eating at George's,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>  it does seem too bad that with every chance to make things good and happy they should fail so completely on so small a cause. I hope you may carry out your idea of getting a little place in Washington and have Mother live there  It would be happiness indeed for her, and for you too for that matter</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot understand how it is that Loo is so stingy nor how it is that George does not correct it<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—I would suppose he would (and naturally he is so) prevent it at once</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hattie wrote you a few days ago—I hope you have it ere this</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Write me when you can and let me know if you are in want of a little money</p>

                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman commented to Walt Whitman that the George Whitman
                    household would be eating a "not very good" piece of beef every day from Sunday
                    "till wensday or thursday." Recognizing that her health was failing and that her
                    appetite was poor, she expressed a desire for something other than "the regular
                    fare" (May 1, 1873 [Trent Collection, William R. Perkins Library, Duke
                    University]). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00473_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00473_n3"><span>A model of thrift
