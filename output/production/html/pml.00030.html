            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have seen Major Saxton, &amp; handed him your note, &amp; the accompanying paper—he said he knew the 4th Auditor personally, &amp; would see him about it, &amp; would probably write to you within three or four days. So Arthur is home, &amp; you are all well—what with the baby &amp; all you women—what jolly times you must have—I wish I could just drop in and take part in them—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">With me, nothing very new or special—I am well &amp; hearty—feel first-rate the greater part of the time—and as to streaks of the other kind of feeling, I am thankful they are so few—for you know I am getting to be an old fellow—though my temperament for buoyancy &amp; fun I believe increases instead of diminishes—I shall take my vacation considerably earlier than usual, this summer—so it wont be long before I shall see you all.</p>
            
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to all—not forgetting the baby.</span>
