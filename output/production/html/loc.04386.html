                <span class="tei_salute">My dearest Friend,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I write this in Dr's office—(3. 10 pm) 
             Dr.  busy—asks me to give you his love. Day gloriously fine—warm 
             as one of our hottest Midsummer days.—We are going
             to drive soon to the cricket ground here (in front of Refractory Wards) to 
             watch a cricket match for a short time. Much cooler to 
             <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">watch</span> it than to take part in it!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was very proud &amp; happy this morning to receive your letter of 
            the 13<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>,
            &amp; the batch of papers you sent me. Thank you from my heart. 
            It stirs me very deeply that you should
            trouble to write in your present circumstances, &amp; nothing 
            that you have ever done seems more characteristic of the love which 
            your whole life exemplifies. Love to you in return—deep &amp; tender
            &amp; lifelong.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And thank you for your advice (to "tie up" &amp;c) so full of tender 
            sympathy &amp; kindness.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad that you "continue same as before" which means really—as 
            you say—"thankful it's no worse"
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00918_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00918_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00918_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            I understand well that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">at best</span> it is "bad enough." I could wish it
            were otherwise if I were not convinced that a divine purpose underlies it all. It seems to be your
            lot—as Symonds says—to teach us not only to live, but how to suffer &amp; to die.
            That there "is all fullness to reward you," I do not doubt,—to 
            reward <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, personally—As for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span>, well, our loving sympathy only goes out to you
            all the more deeply &amp; tenderly.—And all future generations of your lovers
            will think of you with "more tender love.—
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I thank you for Ernest Rhys's letter, &amp; will write to 
             him on my return.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Since I began this Dr. &amp; I have had a drive together to the Cricket 
             Ground—staying there about 10 minutes—match between 
             "Doctors V Lawyers"—D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span>
                just out for about 147 runs—Dr. Beemer
                scoring over 60.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mail just come in with 3 English letters for me—Father, D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> J, &amp;
                RK Greenhalgh. Letters never tasted so good to me as they do now!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am impatient to read them, &amp; will close. Please give my love to M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span>
                Davis &amp; to Warry—&amp; to Traubel
                &amp; his wife. With supreme love to
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> &amp; constant thoughts &amp; good wishes</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Yours affectionately</span>

            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">PS/ Letter from father tells me of two magazines received from you—Thanks! Letter from
                    RKG on Sep 9—supposes that I saw you that 
                    day—&amp; says. "I feel the hour sacred
                    &amp; sweet, for I am sure today has seen the communion of two souls, both dear 
                    as life to me &amp;c." Sends love to you.</p>
