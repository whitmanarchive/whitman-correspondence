                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Friend:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting in my room with my dear little grandson, the sweetest little fellow you ever saw, asleep beside me.<a href="#n0259" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0259">1</a> Giddy<a href="#n0890" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0890">2</a> and Norah<a href="#n3006" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3006">3</a> (my <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="third​ ">3d</span>​  daughter) are gone into Durham to do some shopping. Bee is up in London on her way to Berne in Switzerland, where she has finally decided to complete her medical studies. Herby<a href="#n0262" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0262">4</a> is, I think, staying with Eustace Conway<a href="#n3007" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3007">5</a> at Hammersmith just now. He has been spending a week at Brighton with Edward Carpenter<a href="#n0141b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0141b">6</a> &amp; his family—but I will leave him to tell his own news. We are lodging in this little village with its red-tiled roofs &amp; gray stone walls, lying among wooded hills, corn fields, meadows, and collieries on the banks of the Weir, for the sake of being near Percy &amp; his wife. He is superintending here the erection of some kilns for making the peculiar kind of basic firebricks needed in his dephosphorization process. Durham Cathedral, which was mainly built soon after the Norman conquest, is in sight, crowning a wooded hill that rises abruptly from the river-side. It looks as solid, majestic, venerable as the rocks &amp; hills—the interior is of wonderful grandeur &amp; beauty. When you enter one of these cathedrals you are tempted to say architecture is a lost art with us moderns so far as sublimity is concerned—except in vast engineering works. You would not dignify the Weir with the name of a river in America—it is no bigger than Timber Creek—but it winds about so capriciously through the picturesque little city as to make almost an island of the hill on which the castle &amp; cathedral stand &amp; to need three great solid stone bridges within a quarter of a mile of each other, &amp; with its steep wooded sides carrying nature right into the heart of the old town. But the rainy season (we have scarcely seen the sun since we have been in England &amp; I believe it is the same in France &amp; Italy) and the great depression in trade, especially the coal &amp; iron, which chiefly concerns this district, seem to cast a gloom over everything. There are whole rows of colliers' cottages in this village empty. Where they go to no one knows, but as soon as the collieries reopen they will all reappear. We often meet Colliers returning from work—they look as if they had just emerged from Hades, poor fellows—their faces black as soot—their lean, bowed legs bare—I believe the mines are hot here; they work with little on—but they are really the cleanest of all workmen, as they take a bath every night on their return before supping. The speech here is almost like a foreign tongue to any one from the south or middle of England. I wonder if you have yet read Dr. Bucke's book.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a> It is about the only thing I have read since my return. It suggests deeply interesting trains of thought.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wonder if you are at Camden, taking your daily trips across the ferry &amp; strolls up Chestnut St. I hardly realized till I left it how dearly I love America—great sunny land of hope and progress—or how my whole life has been enriched with the human intercourse I had there. Give my love to those of our friends whom you know &amp; tell them not to forget us. I have had a long letter from Emma Lazarus.<a href="#n1052" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1052">8</a> I suppose Hattie<a href="#n0911" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0911">9</a> and Jessie<a href="#n1055" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1055">10</a> are spending their holidays at Camden &amp; that Hattie has pretty well done with school. We have been chiefly busy with needlework since we came—preparing dear Bee for Berne. I miss her sadly—had quite hoped we should have all been together at Paris this winter—but it seems the course is much longer &amp; more arduous [there]. We spent a week in Edinburgh before we came on here. It is by far the most beautiful city I have ever seen. The journey between it and Berwick-on-Tweed lies through the richest &amp; best cultivated farm land in Britain—the sea sparkling on one side of us &amp; these fertile fields dotted with splendid flocks &amp; herds—with large comfortable-looking farmhouses, &amp; here &amp; there an old castle; it was singularly enjoyable. How I have wished everywhere that you were with us to share the sight—and the best is that you would return home more than ever proud &amp; rejoicing in America. It is a land where humanity is having, and is going to have, such chances as never before. Giddy sends her love. Mine also &amp; to your brother &amp; sister. Good-bye, dear Friend.</p>

                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
