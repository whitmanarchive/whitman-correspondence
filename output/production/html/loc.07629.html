                    with a letter of introduction, and goes off to caricature and lampoon you in a
                    magazine!</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I see the little pieces you send forth. "Yonnondio" is beautiful. The Boston <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Advertiser</span>, which
                    also has for you an aspergil of ice-water, copied it, which is an act of
                    tribute.—I think your term, "Shakespeare-Bacon,"
                    will stick to Verulam. Donnelly is,
                    I guess, in England, getting out his English edition. I have not heard from him
                    since October, and await his movements on tiptoe.</p>
