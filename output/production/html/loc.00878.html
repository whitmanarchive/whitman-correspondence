                    letter shows, the date of this letter reads simply, "Thursday"; because Whitman
                    responded to George Wood's letter on Saturday, <a href="hav.00002">January
                        17, 1863</a>, we might thereby assume that the date of this letter is most
                    likely Thursday, January 15, 1863. George Wood (1799–1870) worked as a
                    clerk in the Treasury Department in 1822, and he held various posts in that
                    bureau until his death. He was the author of several satirical works, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Peter Schlemihl in America</span> (Philadelphia: Carey and Hart,
                    1848) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Gates Wide Open; or, Scenes in Another
                        World</span> (Boston: Lee and Shepard, 1869); see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">National
                        Cyclopaedia of American Biography</span>. Undoubtedly he became acquainted
                    with Whitman through Ellen and William O'Connor. Ellen O'Connor mentioned a Mr.
                    Wood in her letter of <a href="loc.00943">July 5, 1864</a>. In reply to
                    Whitman's letter, evidently delivered by O'Connor and dated
                    "Thursday"—probably <a href="loc.00878">January 15,
                    1863</a>—Wood wrote: "You sometimes find a poor soldier whom a Small Sum
                    would relieve and I beg you will distribute these pieces of paper as you shall
                    see best on your visit to the Hospital." </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
