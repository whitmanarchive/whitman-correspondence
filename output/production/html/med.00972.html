                night, gave in his adhesion to Gen. Taylor,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">3</a> declaring that he should
                vote for him, as the best way to defeat Gen. Cass.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">The brave sailor Jerome,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a> who so heroically
                rescued a number of persons from the burning wreck of the Ocean Monarch, is to be
                donated the freedom of the city (what is it?) in a gold box, to-morrow night, at the
                sailor's church in Roosevelt street. Mr. Banvard<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> departed yesterday
                for Europe, with his panoramas of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers. Of
                course, he will make a good "spec" there, in all probability. His success has given
                rise to a host of imitators. We have panoramic views, now, of nearly all the
                principal rivers of the country. We have even on exhibition here pictures of matters
                and things as they were before the Deluge—doubtless a very correct
                representation. Nothing of importance was done yesterday, at the Episcopal
                Convention; it only organized—electing Dr. Creighton<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">7</a> of Tarrytown, as
                President, and Rev. Mr. Haight,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">8</a> Secretary. One of the disturbing
                questions to come before these potent, grave and reverend signors, is that of the
                admission, on equal terms with whites, of congregations of colored churches. That is
                one branch of the great question. Of course it is very important—to the
                parties concerned.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hear in the city this morning of the death of Michael
                Hoffman,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">9</a> Naval officer, for this city; he was aged sixty years,
                and died last night at his residence in Pacific street, Brooklyn. Mr. Hoffman was a
                well-known politician of the Radical stamp, and had filled offices in the
                Legislature and other positions. He was much beloved by the Silas Wright<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">10</a> democracy,
                who were in daily expectation of hearing of his removal by the National Executive,
                at Washington. The removal, however, has been by a more solemn power, and more
                potent mandate. He is to be taken this afternoon to Herkimer county, his former
                residence, for burial.</p>

                    supported the Whig Party in his early years, though he helped found the Republican Party in 1854.

                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n10">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n10 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n10"><span>Zachary Taylor (1784–1850), a Southern

                    and as Secretary of State under James Buchanan. In 1848 he was the Democratic candidate for president. Cass was a
