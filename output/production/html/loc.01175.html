                open fire place &amp; thinking of you. This little shanty is a real solitude, cut
                off from the house &amp; standing alone here on the brow of the hill. A wild rabbit
                lives under the floor &amp; the wild wood mice scamper over head. But few of my friends
                have

                visited me here, but here I sit by my open fire &amp; have long long thoughts of
                them. How I make them come trooping in. How many times have I planted you there in
                my big chair by the window, or here in front of the open fire &amp; talked the old
                talk with you. Alas, alas, that I should never see you here in the body as well as
                in the spirit. I talk at O'Connors picture &amp; think of him
                too so often, the brilliant one whom I shall see no more.

            How sacred is memory! as we grow old how much he lives in the past, how trivial &amp;
                cheap seems the present. A tender &amp; beautiful light fills my mind when I think
                of those years in Washington when we were all there; a light I know that never was
                on sea or land. How solemn &amp; pathetic, as well as beautiful it must seem to you,
                considering all you passed through there!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Chas. Eldridge sends me his wedding cards from California. I am
                glad he is married &amp; hope he is happy &amp; prosperous. I must write to him.

            my love if you write him. I think I told you we were housekeeping in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pokeepsie​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Poughkeepsie​
        
      </span></span> for the winter. Mrs B &amp; Julian are there now, but I am back on my farm &amp; at work
                for the past two days, &amp; I find it much better than hanging about the miserable
                little city. My winter has been flat stale &amp; unprofitable. I mean to delve the
                earth with vigor now to make up for it. I have seen nobody nor been anywhere. Should
                probably have gone to W. had not wife been sick for 5 weeks with the gripe. I get a
                glimpse of you now &amp; then in the paper. I hope you are comfortable. Do drop me a
                card if you can, or ask <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Trauble​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Traubel​
        
      </span></span> 
                to write me. Our winter has been a perpetual spring as I suppose yours has.</p>
