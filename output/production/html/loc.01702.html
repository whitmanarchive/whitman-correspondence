      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Not knowing whether it will reach you, I will however write a line to acknowledge the
        receipt of your beautiful &amp; elevated "Love &amp; Death," and of the friendly letter from
        you, of October 7th last. I have read &amp; re-read the poem,
        &amp; consider it of the loftiest, strongest &amp; tenderest.
        Your letter was most welcome to me. I should like to know you better, &amp; I wish you to
        send me word should this reach you—if the address is the right one. I wish to forward
        you a copy of my book—as I shall presently bring out a new edition. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, as usual, in good health, and continue to work here in Washington in a government
        office, finding it not unpleasant—finding, in it, indeed sufficient and free
        margin.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pray dont think hard of me for not writing more promptly. I have thought of you more than
        once, &amp; am deeply touched with your poem.
      </p>
