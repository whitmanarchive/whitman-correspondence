      <p class="tei_p">Not knowing whether it will reach you, I will however write a line to acknowledge the
        receipt of your beautiful &amp; elevated "Love &amp; Death," and of the friendly letter from
        you, of October 7th last.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I have read &amp; re-read the poem,
        &amp; consider it of the loftiest, strongest &amp; tenderest.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
        Your letter was most welcome to me. I should like to know you better, &amp; I wish you to
        send me word should this reach you—if the address is the right one. I wish to forward
        you a copy of my book—as I shall presently bring out a new edition. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am, as usual, in good health, and continue to work here in Washington in a government
        office, finding it not unpleasant—finding, in it, indeed sufficient and free
        margin.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pray dont think hard of me for not writing more promptly. I have thought of you more than
        once, &amp; am deeply touched with your poem.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>

                    Love | This Verse | A Feeble Echo of His Song | Is Dedicated." Symonds noted in
                    his letter of <a href="loc.01960">October 7, 1871</a> that his poem "is of
                    course implicit already in your Calamus, especially in 'Scented herbage of my
                    breast.'" The printer's proof of the poem is in the Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C. On December 8, 1872, Symonds wrote to Swinburne, somewhat
                    abjectly, to implore his opinion of his poems: "I sent Walt Whitman the one
                    called 'Love &amp; Death,' &amp; he graciously accepted it as a tribute to the
                    author of Calamus. Yet no one on whose critical faculty I could rely has judged
                    them" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_loc.01702_n4 note" id="loc.01702_n4"><span>Walt Whitman deleted: "I must apologize,

                    Symonds wrote on <a href="loc.01961">February 7, 1872</a>, begging for
                    clarification of "athletic friendship." On <a href="loc.01962">February 25,
                        1872</a>, he sent Walt Whitman "Callicsates," a poem which, like
                    Stoddard's sketches, has homosexual overtones. Perhaps because Symonds pressed
                    too hard, as he was to do again later, for information about the Calamus poems,
                    Walt Whitman did not reply; see Symonds' letter of <a href="loc.01963">June
                        13, 1875</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
