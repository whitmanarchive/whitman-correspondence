      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting up on the side of the bed writing this. Every thing is going on as well with
        me as I could expect. I rec'd your letter, dear mother—you may rest assured that I
        write the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">exact facts</span> about my sickness—I am not gaining very
        fast, but it is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sure</span>—I am on the gain every day a
        little—I still have a good deal of distress in the head—the quieter I am left by
        general visitors the more comfortable I am—I slept fairly last night—&amp; eat
        quite a nice breakfast this morning—(dinner I left mostly untasted)—I have all
        the attention I need, &amp; food &amp;c. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I will write toward the middle of the week—Write whether this &amp; the money come
        safe. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Love to you, dear Mother &amp; George &amp; Lou—&amp; don't be uneasy about me. I have been up by the window looking out on the
        river &amp; scenery—it is beautiful weather now—they have sent over &amp; paid
        me my January pay—all are very kind—</p>
