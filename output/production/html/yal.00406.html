      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting up on the side of the bed writing this. Every thing is going on as well with
        me as I could expect. I rec'd your letter, dear mother—you may rest assured that I
        write the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">exact facts</span> about my sickness—I am not gaining very
        fast, but it is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sure</span>—I am on the gain every day a
        little—I still have a good deal of distress in the head—the quieter I am left by
        general visitors the more comfortable I am—I slept fairly last night—&amp; eat
        quite a nice breakfast this morning—(dinner I left mostly untasted)—I have all
        the attention I need, &amp; food &amp;c. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I will write toward the middle of the week—Write whether this &amp; the money come
        safe. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Love to you, dear Mother &amp; George<a href="#n0700" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0700">2</a> &amp; Lou<a href="#n0368" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0368">3</a>—&amp; don't be uneasy about me. I have been up by the window looking out on the
        river &amp; scenery—it is beautiful weather now—they have sent over &amp; paid
        me my January pay—all are very kind—</p>

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
