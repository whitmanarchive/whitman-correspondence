            <p class="tei_p">I forget what the date may have been when I last wrote to you: more shame to me perhaps, as showing that it must
                at any rate have been a long while ago. Perhaps it may even have been before May 1873. In that month I went
                to Italy on a short trip with some friends, one of them being the daughter,<a href="#n6123" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6123">8</a> whom I had
                known from childhood, of one of my oldest intimates Ford Madox Brown<a href="#n0114" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0114">9</a>

                My wife is greatly interested in you &amp; what concerns you, &amp; bids me not fail to say that she 
                "admires you as much as I do". I remember that her sister,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">10</a> 
                then perhaps barely 17 years of age, seemed more fascinated with your poems, when my selection of them 
                came out towards 1868, than with any other poetical work she had ever seen. She also is an able 
                painter—now married to Dr. Hueffer,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">11</a> a German learned in musical 
                &amp; other matters, who has of late contributed some musical articles to the N.Y. Tribune.

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    as Scotland's national poet. An early Romantic poet who wrote in both Scots and
                    English (often though not exclusively inflected by Scottish dialect), Burns is
                    perhaps best known for his poems "Auld Lang Syne," "Tam o' Shanter" and "To a
                    Mouse" (from which the title of John Steinbeck's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Of Mice and
                        Men</span> is derived). Of Burns, Whitman wrote in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
                        Boughs</span>: "Though so much is to be said in the way of fault-finding,
                    drawing black marks, and doubtless severe literary criticism . . . after full
                    retrospect of his works and life, the aforesaid 'odd-kind chiel' remains to my
                    heart and brain as almost the tenderest, manliest, and (even if contradictory)
                    dearest flesh-and-blood figure in all the streams and clusters of by-gone
                    poets." For Whitman's full opinion of Burns as it appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span>, see "Robert Burns as Poet and Person," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November Boughs</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1888),
