                the pleasure was a somewhat melancholy one yesterday, owing to the far from favourable account <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="​ ">wh.</span>​  
                you give of yourself. It seems a singularly perverse arrangement of nature (but 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> are not the man to complain

                as severe an attack. Believe that 
                you have in this country some most sincere sympathizers, to whom news of your complete recovery

            <p class="tei_p">I look forward with great interest to your proposed volume of prose &amp; verse. The last thing I saw
                of yours was that temperate &amp; discriminating but yet hearty (or it

                I put something about it into a literary weekly review I write in, The Academy. This was

                has probably been done ere now. I shall now put into the Academy the substance of your last 
                note, &amp; of the article in the New Republic. Symonds therein mentioned
                (at least I suppose it is the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">same</span> Symonds) entered years ago into a correspondence
                with me, on the sole basis of his great admiration of your poems. Clifford is regarded

                men of science, very bold in his tone of thought.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I forget what the date may have been when I last wrote to you: more shame to me perhaps, as showing that it must
                at any rate have been a long while ago. Perhaps it may even have been before May 1873. In that month I went
                to Italy on a short trip with some friends, one of them being the daughter, whom I had
                known from childhood, of one of my oldest intimates Ford Madox Brown 
                (a distinguished historical painter—she herself being also a painter of no small attainment). 
                Before we came back from                 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01884.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01884.005_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01884.005_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>                
                the trip, we had resolved that we had better part no more, &amp; in March 1874 we married. 
                My wife is greatly interested in you &amp; what concerns you, &amp; bids me not fail to say that she 
                "admires you as much as I do". I remember that her sister, 
                then perhaps barely 17 years of age, seemed more fascinated with your poems, when my selection of them 
                came out towards 1868, than with any other poetical work she had ever seen. She also is an able 
                painter—now married to Dr. Hueffer, a German learned in musical 
                &amp; other matters, who has of late contributed some musical articles to the N.Y. Tribune. 
                There was also a brother, Oliver Madox Brown, who                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01884.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01884.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01884.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>                
                showed a singular extent of genius, both as painter &amp; as writer: a romance of his, Gabriel Denver, 
                was published in 1873, &amp; his other remaining writings will probably soon be issued. Unfortunately he 
                died in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Novr.</span>​  last of pyæmia,
                aged less than 20. Many a time have I heard him refer to your writings in an enthusiastic spirit.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last month I for the first time in my life faced a public audience (in Birmingham) to deliver a 
                lecture—on Shelley: &amp; I found myself less unfitted for the task than I had 
                apprehended. It was a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">written</span> lecture. There must be a great

                satisfaction in addressing a large audience, for one who can speak wholly or almost extempore, &amp; 
                who feels the magnetic personal thrill between his hearers &amp; himself. You, I think, have on 
                various occasions experienced this pleasure.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This afternoon I shall be seeing one of the interesting old men surviving from a past generation—Trelawny,
                the friend of Shelley &amp; Byron. He has always been a wonderfully strong man, 
                in all senses of the word: &amp; now, well past 80, he wears no under-clothing &amp; no great coat, 
                bathes constantly in cold water &amp; in the sea, prefers to dispense with stockings as he sits at home 
                slip<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01884.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01884.008_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01884.008_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>pered—&amp;c.
