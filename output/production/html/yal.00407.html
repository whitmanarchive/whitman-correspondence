                    Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
                    be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
                    Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
                    William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
                    and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
                    and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
                    William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
                    as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
                    relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r0450">back</a>]</li><li id="n0705">2. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0705 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0705"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
