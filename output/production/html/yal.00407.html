          O'Connor has just been to see me—I was glad to see her—I
        am still improving, but slowly—the doctor did not come yesterday, which I suppose is a
        good sign—I expect him this afternoon or evening—he evidently thinks I am on the
        gain—Pete has just come in, &amp; will take this to the p. o. for me—Love to
        you, dear mother, &amp; to all—</p>
