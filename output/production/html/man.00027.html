                <span class="tei_salute"/>Dear Walt,</span>

            <p class="tei_p">It is a long time since I wrote to you—but I have heard a good deal about you
                from the Gilchrists—about your journey West and back again. I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">am</span> glad you have seen it all, and are satisfied—and

I would like to see you
                and be with you for a little time—it would seem so restful. I wonder now
                whether you have good friends about you at Camden, and feel at peace, spite of
                illness. Do you sometimes feel really satisfied, and as if you didn't care what
                happened, knowing it is done and can never be undone—dear Walt I wish you
                could live and renew your strength again in all those whom <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00182_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00182_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00182_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>you have delivered. But perhaps you
                do so. I have long had it on my mind to write and ask you about the possibility of
                publishing a cheaper edition of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">y<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">r</span></span>​  Leaves of Grass in England;—there are so many now who cannot afford
                the long price of present editions. I have thought that the sale might be so
                increased by a cheaper edition (say a 7/6 one) as even to pay you. But then
                there is the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00042_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00042_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00042_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>difficulty of publishers (Trübner <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="would​ ">w<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span></span>​  I think do you justice); and of course you could not issue your present
                stereotyped <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="edition​ ">ed<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">n</span></span>​  in England at a lower price than in America. Still, what if a few friends
                in England combined to undertake the expense of a comparatively cheap edition, sell
                it through Trübner or some other publisher, and the profits to go to you. Would
                you approve? I have thought a good deal about it, and that is the only feasible plan <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh</span>​  occurs to me—that will make the book accessible <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00043_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00043_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00043_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>to the people, and
                also pay you. But then again, would such a cheaper <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="edition​ ">ed<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">n</span></span>​  be pirated across the Atlantic &amp; sold in the U.S.A in competition with
                yours? Of course you have thought all this over: but you may not realise, what I am
                only beginning to realise, the great demand <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wh</span>​  is likely to arise here for your works, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> among the literary
                world but among the ordinary working day world. I have often been asked lately about

                every paragraph. I considered it would be better to praise the whole book, for it is
                all excellent. It is to be hoped Whitman will publish a cheaper edition of his
                splendid works. He is one of those whom <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00184_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fman_ej.00184_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fman_ej.00184_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>mankind in the future will surely

I believe I once mentioned to you a M<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">rs</span> Hardy who is now out in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Pennsylvania​ ">Penn<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">a</span></span>​  (Lawrence C<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">o</span>).

                to be at work out in the country near here—at first on some land of
