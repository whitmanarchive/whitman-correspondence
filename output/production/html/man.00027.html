                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    Grace, Percy and Herbert. Anne Gilchrist wrote one of the first significant
                    pieces of criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "A Woman's

                    Gilchrist's long correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in
                    love with the poet after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she
                    visited Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. Anne's son Herbert (1857–1914) was
                    a painter and shared his mother's fascination for Whitman. For more on Whitman

                    one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
                    via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
                    of <a href="loc.04038">March 18, 1879</a>). Ruskin, according to Whitman,

                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
