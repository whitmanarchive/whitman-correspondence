                    was the son of Henry Wilson (1805–1870)—a harness and trunk maker—and
                    Ann S. Williams Wilson (1809–1887). Benton Wilson was a U. S. Civil War soldier recovering in Armory Square Hospital 
                    in Washington, D.C., when he met Whitman. Later, Wilson was employed selling melodeons and sewing machines. He also
                    sold life insurance and may have worked as a pawnbroker. He married 
                    Nellie Gage Morrell Wilson (ca. 1841–1892). Nellie had two children, Lewis
                    and Eva Morrell, from a previous marriage, and she and Benton were the parents of five children.
                    Wilson named his first child "Walter Whitman Wilson," after the poet; their other
                    children were Austin, Irene, Georgie, and Kathleen Wilson. Benton Wilson's
                    correspondence with Whitman spanned a decade, lasting from 1865 to 1875. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01988_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01988_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:

                        and Wilson, a former U. S. Civil War soldier, can be reconstructed from
                        Wilson's letters (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                        1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On <a href="loc.01997">July 18, 1869</a>, Wilson recalled his confinement
                        in Armory Square Hospital (as mentioned in Whitman's <a href="loc.00802">November 8–9, 1863</a>, letter to Lewis K. Brown), "when your
                        kind face &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won their
                        hearts. I never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp; I
                        got there. We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's
                        first letter, written on <a href="loc.00611">November 11, 1865</a>, he
                        began: "I suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this
                        time but I have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be
                        forgotten by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on <a href="loc.00614">December 16, 1866</a>: "I wish if aggreeable to
                        yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us ... I think it will
                        be of benefit to me morally, and perhaps will not be of any detriment to
                        you." In this letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Whitman
                        was a poet. On <a href="loc.01987">January 27, 1867</a>, he informed
                        Whitman that he had been reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, but
                        complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago that I was married but did
                        not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was displeased with it"; he
                        concluded the letter: "I remain as ever your<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> Boy Friend<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> with
                        Love<span class="before_br"> </span><br/><span class="after_br"> </span> Benton H. Wilson." Walt Whitman replied (lost), and sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray Poet</span>, which Wilson acknowledged on <a href="loc.01988">February 3, 1867</a>. On <a href="loc.01989">April 7, 1867</a>, after he informed Whitman that his wife had gone
                        to the hospital for her first confinement (the child was to be named Walt
                        Whitman), Wilson complained: "I am poor and am proud of it but I hope to
                        rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am not happy for my
                        disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I love her dearly but
                        I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had ought to live alone, but
                        I had not ought to feel so." On <a href="loc.01990">April 21,
                        1867</a>, Wilson acknowledged Whitman's reply of <a href="loc.01562">April 12, 1867</a>: "I do not want you to misunderstand my motives in
                        writing to you of my Situation &amp; feelings as I did in my last letter or
                        else I shall have to be more guarded in my letters to you. I wrote so
                        because you wanted me to write how I was situated, and give you my mind
                        without reserve, and all that I want is your advice and Love, and I do not
                        consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish you to write to me just as
                        you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as freely as you wish and will be
                        satisfied." On <a href="loc.01991">September 15, 1867</a>, Wilson
                        wondered why Whitman had not replied. In his letter of <a href="loc.01998">December 19, 1869</a>, Wilson
                        reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still selling melodeons
                        and sewing machines. On <a href="loc.01999">May 15, 1870</a>, Wilson
                        informed Whitman of his father's death two weeks earlier and related that
                        his son "Little Walt . . . is quite a boy now . . . and gets into all kinds
                        of Mischief." Evidently Wilson wrote to the poet for the last time on <a href="nyp.00398">June 23, 1875</a>, when he wanted to know "what I
                        can do to contribute to your comfort and happiness." </span></span> [<a href="#r0810">back</a>]</li><li id="n5002d">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_xml:id_n5002d tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n5002d"><span>This letter has not been

                    most frequently visited in Washington, D.C., during the Civil War. Because of
                    Armory Square's location near a steamboat landing and railroad, it received the
                    bulk of serious casualties from Virginia battlefields. At the end of the war, it
                    recorded the highest number of deaths among Washington hospitals. See Martin G.

                    secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed Whitman from his
                    second-class clerkship on <a href="nyp.00222">June 30, 1865</a>. Harlan
                    apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> which Whitman was revising and which he kept at his desk. With
                    the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant Attorney General J. Hubley
                    Aston, Whitman secured a position in the attorney general's office. The Harlan
                    episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet." Although
                    Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman may have sarcastically
                    applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865, Harlan had issued an
                    official directive asking for the names of employees who disregarded "in their
                    conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum &amp; propriety
                    prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman's Champion</span> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M University Press,
                    1978], 57). Harlan resigned in 1866 and returned to the Senate in the following
                    year. </span></span> [<a href="#r0287">back</a>]</li></ul>
