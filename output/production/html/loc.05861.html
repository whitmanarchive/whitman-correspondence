            <p class="tei_p">–poorly continued—head, belly &amp; bladder
                matters—am sitting here in big chair as usual—Mrs: D over
                at Phila—Warry down stairs—made my breakfast
                of toast tea &amp; fresh egg.—pleasant weather—the travel
                clear—Herbert Gilchrist comes often—Geo:
                    Stafford is better—Harry S is
                pretty well—has to move—wants to go back to RR employment—You know
                ab't Kennedys "Dutch Traits of WW"
                well Horace T has the MS &amp; is to print it in his little
                paper, next but one—(HT is very active &amp; popular—quite
                ardent—as you know is very radical &amp; revolutionary in all this business of
                technical theological &amp; political reform) is permanently assiduous &amp; helpful
                &amp; friendly to me all along—the one o'clock big whistle just blows 1½
                fair debouch f'm water works—first for 20 hours</p>

                Ingersoll book is out I have not seen it but Horace has one
                &amp; says it is well done printerially &amp; bookishly for that kind of
                thing—quiet &amp; monotonous with me so far to day no letters—buckwheat
                cakes &amp; honey for breakfast—pretty fair night last—am writing a
                little—the printing of the reduced photo on celluloid plate new style (WW 1890
                ¾ length in chair) is specially well done—same as y'r large
                photo—if you want any of these small ones I can supply you—I return
                herewith JW Wallace's letter to you—the rain &amp; dark
                seem to be set in for the day—Best physical &amp;c: feelings early
