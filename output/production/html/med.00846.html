            <p class="tei_p">Sir, I will have 150 (not 50 nor 100) copies bound in the style I like—as sample.—I
                send 100 autograph sheets—(50 were sent before.) I send 100 labels—(50 were sent
                before.) The sample made up is herewith—partly as sample which all copies will be
                compared strictly by—and partly to put in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the right page for "Specimen Days" title
                    back'd with the copyright line</span>, wh' in present is out (the printer's fault)
                endangering our copyright. Please see the right ones get in these copies.</p>
