                bit of dinner for the first time in over a week—(stewed rabbit, with a piece
                of splendid home-made buttered bread, covered with the stew gravy)—Every thing
                from you rec'd &amp; welcomed—dull weather, the ground covered with
                snow—(but my little bird is singing as I write)—</p>
