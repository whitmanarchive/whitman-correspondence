            <p class="tei_p">I send you an original piece of mine, in hopes it will be found available for say the 
                March Number of your magazine. The price is 4 pounds—$20—in gold—and four copies of the number in which it is printed, sent me by mail.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Please send me an answer, with decision, by next or succeeding mail.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My address is Attorney Gen's office, this city.</p>
