                    (1838–1923), a statesman as well as a man of letters, was editor of the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Fortnightly Review</span> from 1867 to 1882. He had visited
                    Whitman in February 1868; see Whitman's <a href="col.00001">February 17,
                        1868</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway and Morley's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Recollections</span> (1917), 2:105. Morley replied on <a href="loc.01810">January 5, 1869</a>, that he could not print Walt Whitman's poem ("Thou
                    vast Rondure, Swimming in Space") until April: "If that be not too late for you,
                    and if you can make suitable arrangements for publication in the United States
                    so as not to interfere with us in point of time, I shall be very glad."
                    Unaccountably, the poem did not appear in print. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
