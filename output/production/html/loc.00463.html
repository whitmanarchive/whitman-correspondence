            <p class="tei_p">Mattie is, I think a little improved since I last wrote you—she passed an easier night last night—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Friday she went down to a photograph gallery in a carriage and we took her in a chair up the stairs—I had a lady sent there to fix her hair and dress her and altogether I think we obtained a most excellent picture of her—though I hav'nt seen the pictures yet</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I do not think she suffers so much—though yesterday she had a bad day all day—on account of the excitement</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Love to all—will write again to morrow</p>
