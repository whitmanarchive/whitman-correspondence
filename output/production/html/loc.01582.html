            <p class="tei_p">I will write you just a line, to let you know I have not forgotten you. 
                I am here on leave, &amp; shall stay nearly all this month. Duffy is here, 
                driving on Broadway &amp; 5th av. line. He has been up the Hudson river this 
                summer driving hotel coach. He is the same old Duffy. I have heard that 
                William Sydnor on 65, was laid up sick. I wish to hear about him, &amp; whether he is well, 
                &amp; again at work. If you see him, tell him I have not forgot him, but send him 
                my love, &amp; will be back in Washington again. Tell Johnny Miller<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> there is 
                still a sprinkling of the old Broadway drivers left. Balky Bill,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> Fred Kelly, Charley McLaughlin, Tom Riley,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> 
                Prodigal, Sandy, &amp;c. &amp;c. are still here. Frank McKinney<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">5</a> &amp; several other old 
                drivers are with Adams Express. Staging is rather dull.
