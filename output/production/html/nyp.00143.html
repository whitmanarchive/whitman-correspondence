            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">My brother wishes me to inform you of the state of his health, also of his journey home he arrived home last week Wednesday very much exhausted &amp; he was obliged to take to his bed from which he has not yet got up. he has put off writing every day thinking the next day he would be able to write himself. He often speaks of you telling of your kindness during his sickness there, and wishes he could see you and tried to gratify himself by looking at your portraits which he has out 5 or 6 times during the day. the sister whom you have heard him speak of as being sick so long was carried to the Insane Hospital the day before his arrival. he is very anxious to hear from you &amp; wants you should write him a good long letter to cheer him up for he has had the blues once since he came home.
