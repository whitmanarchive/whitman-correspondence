He often speaks of you telling of your kindness during his sickness there, and wishes he could see you and tried to gratify himself by looking at your portraits which he has out 5 or 6 times during the day. the sister whom you have heard him speak of as being sick so long was carried to the Insane Hospital the day before his arrival. he is very anxious to hear from you &amp; wants you should write him a good long letter to cheer him up for he has had the blues once since he came home.<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a>

                    Curtis in a <a href="loc.00801">October 28, 1863</a>, Caleb Babbitt
                    suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square Hospital.
                    According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library), Babbitt had
                    been in Mobile, Alabama, earlier. About August 1, 1863, he left Washington on
                    furlough. In this letter, Caleb's sister, Mary A. Babbitt informed Whitman of
                    Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because of his exhaustion he was unable
                    to write. Mary acknowledged Whitman's letter on <a href="nyp.00145">September 6, 1863</a>, and wrote that Caleb was "not quite as well as
                    when I wrote you before…he wishes me to tell you to keep writing…for your
                    letters do him more good than a great deal of medicine." On <a href="nyp.00146">September 18, 1863</a>, at the expiration of his
                    forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong enough to write: "Walt—In your
                    letters you wish me to imagine you talking with me when I read them, well I do,
                    and it does very well to think about, but it is nothing compared with the
                    original." On <a href="nyp.00148">October 18, 1863</a>, Babbitt was
                    depressed—"dark clouds seem to be lying in my pathway and I can not remove
                    them nor hide them from my mind"—until he mentioned his beloved, Nellie F.
                    Clark, who "has saved me." On <a href="nyp.00150">October 26, 1863</a>, S.
                    H. Childs wrote for Caleb from the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston: "He
                    Is unable to set up &amp; suffers considerable pain In his
                    head."
