            <p class="tei_p">Very hot &amp; sultry &amp; oppressive—Getting along pretty well,
                considering—your letters rec'd—a devout Catholic <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">faith cure</span> priest (or group) has or have sent me some ardent
                advice over here from France by mail—came yesterday—Bowels moved Friday and Saturday &amp; even to some effect even this (Sunday)
                forenoon—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Tom Harned came back last evening, after a week at Chicago—it looks at
                present as tho' after the chaos &amp; row &amp; unsettledness, have all
                settled—for definite shibboleth and ticket—that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Blaine</span>

                the fight to do its best—not a bad game—Well, we'll see—</p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I have sent the 20 pages proofs complete to Wm O Connor—the "Sands at
                Seventy"—wh' said 20 pp he will send to you in ab't three days—you will
                then have the first 38 pages proof—(I am inferring that O'C is
                better)—The new little "November Boughs" is slowly but steadily
                moving—Horace Traubel is invaluable to me in it—My head in preparing my
                copies or reading proof is poorly, dull, raw, no weak grip, no consecutive, no
                racionative power—Well it is getting on in afternoon &amp; I have sat up three
                hours—Havn't got out of this room yet—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Best remembrance &amp; thanks &amp; love to Pardee earnestly he will have a good
                turn—(who was the old veteran had a saying <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">God &amp; time
