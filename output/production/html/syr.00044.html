            <p class="tei_p">Your post card of 22<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> came to hand this morning [.] I am
                glad you are able to say that you are "fairly well". Shall try to see the 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> vol. of Am. Sup. to Ency. Brit. I have the Ency. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">itself</span> but not the supplement.
                Have spent an hour today most pleasantly looking over the drafts of "The Song of the
                Redwood Tree." Studying it all from the newspaper piece (which seems to have
                suggested it) to the finished, printed, poem. It is all most interesting and
                    suggestive. [—] Still the same wonderfull
                weather here, warm—bright—sunny—. Willy Gurd
                is here still will go East to work at meter probably early next week. The scheme at
                present is as follows: Gurd will go East and make a gas meter, then our New York
                partner will establish a company to manufacture—we hope to be making meters by
                the autumn but there may be other slips ahead of us yet and we count on nothing too
                certainly [/] We will just jog along and do our best and leave the rest to
                Providence. After all it is a matter of little consequence [/] we have done very
                well for a long time now without the meter and I guess we can get on all right
                without it still. One thing I would like to know (tho' I suppose I never shall) that
                is how Harned accounts (to himself) for his failure to
                carry out his agreement with us?</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have sent copies of the Inspector's Annual Report (in which mine is printed) and
                shall send you one as soon as I get them</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All well and quiet here</p>
