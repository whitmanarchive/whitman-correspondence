            <p class="tei_p">Your post card of 22<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> came to hand this morning [.] I am
                glad you are able to say that you are "fairly well". Shall try to see the 4<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> vol. of Am. Sup. to Ency. Brit.

                Have spent an hour today most pleasantly looking over the drafts of "The Song of the
                Redwood Tree." Studying it all from the newspaper piece (which seems to have
                suggested it) to the finished, printed, poem. It is all most interesting and
                    suggestive.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> [—] Still the same wonderfull
                weather here, warm—bright—sunny—. Willy Gurd<a href="#n4284" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4284">4</a>
                is here still will go East to work at meter probably early next week. The scheme at
                present is as follows: Gurd will go East and make a gas meter, then our New York
                partner will establish a company to manufacture—we hope to be making meters by
                the autumn but there may be other slips ahead of us yet and we count on nothing too
                certainly [/] We will just jog along and do our best and leave the rest to
                Providence. After all it is a matter of little consequence [/] we have done very
                well for a long time now without the meter and I guess we can get on all right
                without it still. One thing I would like to know (tho' I suppose I never shall) that
                is how Harned<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">5</a> accounts (to himself) for his failure to
                carry out his agreement with us?<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a></p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
