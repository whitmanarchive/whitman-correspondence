            <p class="tei_p">I was really astonished to hear my quondam college mate—young Henry Norman—was the one who engineered the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Pall
                    Mall Gazette</span> subscription. I always knew Norman had a soft spot 'way down
                deep in him somewhere. There was a race-antipathy between us, however. I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">suspect</span> I was the one who first introduced you to him. For
                when we were in college together in Cambridge Mass. I was in the first flush of my
                enthusiasm for you; had just read you for the first time, &amp; after a while I came
                out &amp; made a solemn confession of faith before the whole Divinity
                School—Professors &amp; all— &amp; told them what I had found in you.
                They were a band of earnest liberal fellows (Norman &amp; I the best read of 'em)
                &amp; I saw that they did not laugh, &amp; that my solemnity impressed them. I

                friend, that you–being of English &amp; Dutch stock—do not find in you the
                race-antipathy that I—a French-Scotch-Irish-Englishman find in me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As to Norman—It is what we might expect to find one of <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="your​ ">yr</span>​  opposites seeking you for inspiration. He certainly <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">needs</span> you, if any man does—in the heart department he is quite
                stony—veilled by culture &amp; Unitarianism (or was 8 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="years​ ">yrs</span>​  ago: I suspect he has <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mellowed</span> since that) His
                father is a wealthy Unitarian manufacturer of Leicester County England. Norman is
                intellectually brilliant, &amp; no mistake. We have had some tiffs in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Critic</span>. But I wish him well. His <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="pamphlet​ ">pam.</span>​  on the Irish evictions won my sympathy, &amp; now what Rhys tells me of this Pall Mall matter increases my esteem.
                We must <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="even​ ">een</span>​  love
                him, Hal. I suppose.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Rhys continues his schemes on society's pocket-book, &amp; demoralizes my nerves
                frightfully when I see him, somehow. Charity, charity, man, I keep saying (&amp;
