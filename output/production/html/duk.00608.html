    <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n4">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00608_n4 note" id="duk.00608_n4"><span><p class="tei_p">This letter is nearly
                        impossible to date precisely. Richard Maurice Bucke dated it April 3, 1871,
                        and Edwin Haviland Miller dated it April 16?, 1871 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University
                        Press, 1961–77], 2:368). Because the letter refers both to an expected
                        visit from George Washington Whitman and his "wife" that has been postponed
                        until the following Saturday and to "quite a seige [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>] the last month or so," a phrase that presumably refers to the
                        departure of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman and daughters Manahatta and
                        Jessie Louisa after an extended visit, the letter dates at least a week (and
                        perhaps several) after the marriage of George to Louisa Orr Haslam and a few
                        (or several) days after the departure of Jeff Whitman's family. One separate
                        matter, the expected move of the Mann family, may suggest a late April date.
                        However, these factors cannot be pinned down with certainty, so the letter
                        could date as early as March 19, 1871, as late May 14, 1871, and to almost
                        any Sunday in between.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">If George has a "wife" already, the letter dates no earlier than the Sunday
                        that followed his marriage. George married Louisa Orr Haslam on either March
                        14, 1871 or April 14, 1871. Whitman scholars since Gay Wilson Allen have
                        preferred the April date: see Richard Maurice Bucke, "Genealogy of Whitman
                        Family," Trent Collection, Duke University, reprinted in Gay Wilson Allen,
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
                        596. This assumption probably guided Miller's April 16? date for this
                        letter. However, Allen's source, Bucke's typescript genealogy, is derived
                        from a manuscript in Walt Whitman's hand, and Whitman's manuscript differs:
                        Whitman identified March 14, 1871 as George's marriage date. See Walt
                        Whitman, "Marriages," Missouri Historical Society, reprinted in Edward F.
                        Grier, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose
                            Manuscripts</span> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 27.
                        Bucke's notation on Louisa's <a href="duk.00603">March 7?–May 15?,
                            1871</a> letter to Walt also differs: there Bucke writes "George
                        married March '71." An independent source derived from Camden county records
                        also dates George's marriage March 14 (H. Stanley Craig, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Camden County New Jersey Marriages, 1837–1910: Records Filed in
                            the Office of the County Clerk</span> [Merchantville, New Jersey: H.
                        Stanley Craig, 1932], 133). As two independent sources, one in Walt's hand
                        and one derived independently from county marriage records agree on March
                        14, the date of this letter, if to a Sunday just after George's marriage, is
                        March 19 or March 26, 1871.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p"> If Louisa's reference to a "seige [<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sic</span>] the last
                        month or so" refers to the visit of Jeff Whitman's family to Brooklyn, their
                        departure to return to St. Louis dates four to six weeks after their
                        arrival. Louisa at one time expected Mattie and daughters to arrive in
                        Brooklyn in early February: "we are looking for matt," Louisa wrote in her
                            <a href="duk.00609">February 9, 1871</a> letter to Walt. The
                        two-week discrepancy between Louisa's initial and later expectation of
                        Mattie's arrival highlights the speculative quality of presumptions that
                        have guided this initial assignment of the letter's date to March 19 or
                        March 26, 1871. Questioning those assumptions undermines either of those
                        possible dates. The phrase "month or so" may refer to the entire visit of
                        four to six weeks by Mattie and family in Brooklyn, but another letter
                        places Mattie and family in Brooklyn and on the point of departure for
                        Camden with George. See Louisa's <a href="duk.00603">March 7?–May
                            15?, 1871</a> letter to Walt, which is assigned a most probable range
                        of March 7 to March 21, 1871. If Louisa defined her "seige" as having begun
                        after the return of Mattie and daughters from Camden, Jeff's family's visit
                        could have begun in late February and continued for a few weeks before the
                        departure to Camden. If Mattie and daughters departed Camden to return to
                        Brooklyn on March 21 or so, their return could mark the new start as an
                        extended month-plus visit to Brooklyn (the "seige").</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In addition, at the time of the letter Louisa expected the Mann family to
                        move soon, and that expectation may date this letter to April 30, 1871, just
                        before May 1, the typical moving day in Brooklyn. However, the most common
                        date for moving is highly speculative if it cannot be corroborated by
                        another factor. And it cannot be in this case. Ultimately, any factor cited
                        so far may be independent of the others: the Mann family's moving day, the
                        arrival of Jeff's family in Brooklyn, George and Louisa Orr's marriage date,
                        the visit of Jeff's family to George and Louisa Orr in Camden, the start and
                        end of the approximately month-long "seige," the separation of Jeff's
                        family's visit into multiple stages, and the departure of Jeff's family for
                        St. Louis. Therefore, the letter may date between possible marriage dates,
                        from March 20 to 27. The full range of possible dates, given either of the
                        two marriage dates, is March 20 to May 14, but the most probable date
                        range—if Jeff's family has departed for St. Louis, their visit began
                        in late February and extended for approximately six weeks, and George and
                        Louisa Orr married on March 14, 1871—is April 9 or April 16, 1871, a
                        week or so after Mattie and daughters departed to return to St. Louis. If
                        the April 14 marriage date is assumed, the latest date, April 30, 1871, is
                        preferred as it corresponds also to Brooklyn's moving day.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00556_n3 note" id="duk.00556_n3"><span>George Washington Whitman
                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
                    in spring 1871.

                    expired, was the typical moving day in Brooklyn. The Mann family—though
                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman usually spells their name "man"—lived downstairs
                    from her at 1149 Atlantic Avenue between September 1868 and April 1869. Shortly
                    after Louisa's arrival at Atlantic Avenue, a young child in the family, named
                    Charley, succumbed to the croup (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00552">November
                        10, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman). She mentioned the Mann family in
                    multiple letters while at 1149 Atlantic Avenue, just after they moved in, but
                    aside from this single brief reference she made no mention of them after her
                    move to Portland Avenue in April 1869. This letter, by indicating that the Manns
                    were moving out, suggests that they were either taken on as boarders in the
                    Portland Avenue house that George Washington Whitman built as a residence for
                    his mother or rented one of George's other houses. Louisa did remain in contact
                    with the Mann family: her letter to Mary E. Mann shortly after the death of
                    Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman is not extant, but Mary Mann's <a href="loc.00637">March 9, 1873</a> reply indicates that Louisa had
                    reported on Walt's stroke and on her residence with George and wife Louisa Orr
                    in Camden. Louisa also inquired about the health of Mary, her three daughters,
                    and Mary's mother. In 1873 the Mann family resided at 89 North Portland Avenue
