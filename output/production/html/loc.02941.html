            <p class="tei_p">The enforced infrequency of my gossippy letters turns often to my advantage, since it
                brings you out in a nice page letter to know why the garrulous voice from Belmont
                (the cicada) has intermitted its notes. (Just laid my pen down to see to a sick cat I
                am doctoring: how curious the habit we have of laying a pen down, &amp; forgetting
                totally where we put it!)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Your Kottabos rec'd &amp; letter. Why, yes, I confess I felt a good deal of sympathy for our
                cranky friend Johnson the planter His insinuations as to assumed peccadiloes of yrs were of no importance in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my eyes</span> but such things
                if spoken of to third parties sometimes do mischief. Though, supposing all the
                things he mentioned were so, (and doubtless some of them were in a measure) they wd not affect a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rational</span> man's temper or friendship
                a jot. But, unfortunately, our fellow-men are far from being rational.</p>

                course wrote without the knowledge of any one else) if he wd like to say a few words of you for the appendix to the book. Also wrote to
                Enrico Nencioni (c/o <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Nuova Anotologia</span>, Rome) asking him to

                work at office 9 hours. I think I must solve the problem by having both wife &amp; I

            <p class="tei_p">Rhys's Chickering Hall lecture being worse than a failure
                (financially) some of his Back Bay friends have got him up a private lecture in
                grand style, &amp; passed around the hat to the tune of $200. Chamberlin who writes the Listener for the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Transcript</span> had Rhys at his home
                for a month. Rhys drove him frantic, as he did us, &amp; Chamberlin one day <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">disappeared</span> leaving R. with the three children. C's
                friends find him out; doctor says he is over-worked; send him to Savannah (that is
                the reason <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Listener</span> is so brief lately, as you see); C's

                Kate Gannett Wells. It is a dreadful pity that R. is so on the wrong track as to the

                out of this soon, or he is lost.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have not much faith in the despatch of F.W. Wilson: we must let him drag, I
                suppose. I have sent him 20 names. 
            He <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">must</span> have a hundred, at least, by this time. Not a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">written</span> word fr. him since I sent him the 150 circulars. But he is evidently crawling on,
