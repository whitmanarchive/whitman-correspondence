                brings you out in a nice page letter to know why the garrulous voice from Belmont
                (the cicada) has intermitted its notes. (Just laid my pen down to see to a sick cat I
                am doctoring: how curious the habit we have of laying a pen down, &amp; forgetting
                totally where we put it!)</p>

                things he mentioned were so, (and doubtless some of them were in a measure) they wd not affect a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rational</span> man's temper or friendship
                a jot. But, unfortunately, our fellow-men are far from being rational.</p>

                    letter from <a href="loc.01838">September 13, 1874</a>: a former Rebel
                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
                    war he had been "a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slaveholding</span> youthful 'patriarch.'"
                    He informed Whitman in the <a href="loc.01837">August 13, 1874</a>, letter
                    that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                    Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                    that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                    Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                    profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                    after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
                    mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes with the usual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lack</span> of
