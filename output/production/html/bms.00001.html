                    for letting me have it! I will get as much as I can out of the publishers; for
                    as Walter Scott is one of the largest railway contractors, as well as a
                    publisher, &amp; well stocked with money, I have no scruple on that score. It is
                    not easy in any case to get much out of him, unfortunately. For my own sake, as
                    well as yours, I wish it were!" On <a href="loc.03316">January 19,
                        1887</a>, he informed Whitman that Scott was willing to pay ten guineas
