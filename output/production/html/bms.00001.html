            <p class="tei_p">First I ought to apologize for not answering your letters before—I am always
                glad to get them—Nothing specially new or different with me—I am willing
                you should print "Specimen Days" in your series—let W[alter] S[cott] send me
                what he thinks he can afford, &amp; I shall want 10 copies of the book. I should advise you to leave out the Appendix—If
                you want it further cut down, let me furnish you with a prepared copy—</p>
