               </span>
               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly</span>
            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I have received your letter, also Charles Eldridge's &amp; Mrs Cooper's. Nelly, I hope this will find you better of your cold, &amp; that you &amp; all the rest are well &amp; [in] good spirits.<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> Tell Mrs Cooper I heartily accept her invitation to visit at Philadelphia, &amp; if I can work it so I will come gladly.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I think about you all, &amp; frequently. I have told my mother &amp; sister about you all. I send my love to William. I feel that I have never had a better friend, &amp; that no truer nor warmer heart beats. Tell Charles Eldridge too I send him my love. I regret his not likely meeting me in New York to go around together. But, Charley, we will have it yet, dear comrade. I received the letters you sent under envelope. For all &amp; sundry, &amp; the year's most valuable kindness, from you three, what can I say, more than that I am sure I appreciate it.
Nelly, I had a pleasant trip that Monday from the start, &amp; all through—clear &amp; cool &amp; no dust—I got home about 8 in evening—was up bright &amp; early to the polls next morning &amp;c. How well the election went in this state, you know.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> Here Brooklyn gave a stunning union vote, the biggest ever dreamed of here—Mayor, assemblymen, judges, all elected. Nelly, I am writing this from my room at my mother's house. It is Sunday afternoon, dripping &amp; rainy, the air thick &amp; warm, &amp; the sky lowering. My poor brother Andrew is very ill. It is not likely he can live. His voice is quite gone. Still he moves about &amp; is here all the time during the day. My sister Martha is untiring, feeding &amp; nursing him. Of her children, little Hattie is well—the new baby is immense, &amp; I take to her in proportion. I want her to be called California. She is fully worthy the name. She is large, calm, not pretty but something ahead of that, full of latent fire in the eyes (which are grey) &amp; a complete success every way. Mother is very well &amp; active &amp; cheerful—she still does her own light housework, &amp; keeps up handsomely under her surroundings of domestic pressure—one case of sickness &amp; its accompanying irritability—two of grown helplessness<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—&amp; the two little children, very much with her, &amp; one of them unsurpassed in volatility &amp; restlessness—Nelly, I have thought before that the real &amp; best bravery is to be discovered somewhere else than in the bravery of war, &amp; beyond the heroisms of men. My brother Jeff is well—he is a noble young man &amp; one to love.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I find my New York boys the same gay-hearted, joyous fellows, full of friendship &amp; determined to have pleasure. We have been together quite a good deal. They have given me little supper parties, men only, with drinking &amp;c. Of course we have great times. I have been several times to the Opera &amp; to French theatre. The opera here, Maretzek's troupe,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> is very fine. Medori, soprano, is pretty near perfection—Mazzoleni, tenor, ditto—Biachi, base, ditto. Miss Kellogg is also good. The pieces were Lucrezia, Sonnambula, &amp;c.<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I have seen Charles Howells.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> He is well—apparently indeed better than he was in Washington (in health I mean). I have been at the place, 15 Charles street. In the parlor is hung up a large blue placard "Headquarters of the Pantarchy" in white letters. I did not stop to dinner, although I was prest hard. I saw a man named Newbold.<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> Charles Howells is cheerful. We had quite a walk. He told me he was doing well in a business point of view, had made more while in New York than his salary would have been in Idaho. I did not see Mr nor Mrs Andrews.<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a> I did not make any demonstration upon Charles, except what was probably significant enough during the course of his flourishing &amp; somewhat elaborated statement of the Pantarchian scheme which I listened to in dead silence, broken only by one or two running questions of a very brief &amp; dry character. Charles was full of friendship &amp; our interview was one in which he imprest me more agreeably than ever before. Surely he is a good man. The impression I received (maybe casual) is that he is partially absorbed there, his own yearning &amp; eager nature supplying the fuel of the flame, but that he is really shrewd at bottom, &amp; may prove more able to pick his way through the humbugs of the world than we were thinking.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nelly, I have seen Mrs Price, but not to have much true &amp; friendly talk, as there were many present. She is much <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">less</span> well than I expected—has a hacking cough. She preserves the same quiet cheerful way—&amp; her daughters—dear girls—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love deeply.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nelly, if you go down to Armory Square—or if Mrs Howells should, (&amp; if you feel well, &amp; like going, I much wish you would very soon) please find if Pleasant Borley<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a> is living, he is in bed 40 in Ward A—tell him I am coming back soon, (or tell Miss Gregg,<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> for him)—Also see James S Stilwell<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">12</a> in Ward C, &amp; Thomas Carson<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">13</a> in same ward—also Lewis K Brown<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">14</a> in Ward K, (I have sent him a long letter)—also Oscar Cunningham<a href="#n15" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r15">15</a> in Ward K—also tell Mrs Doolittle<a href="#n16" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r16">16</a> in Ward B, I want to see the boys there. I shall probably stay five or six days longer. I count on our all being together again. My head &amp; hearing &amp;c. are better yesterday &amp; to-day than for two weeks—sometimes have been rather disagreeable. Well, Nelly, I will now bid you good bye for present, my truly dear friend, &amp; good bye to the rest, &amp; God bless you all.<a href="#n17" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r17">17</a>

                    with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs,
                    were to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>,
                    an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
                    O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
                    1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
                    Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
                    Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
                    correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
                    correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00185_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00185_n2"><span>The identity of Mrs. Cooper
                    is unclear. A Mrs. Cooper is mentioned in Whitman's notation on Ellen O'Connor's
                    letter of <a href="loc.00940">November 10, 1863</a>, and on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, O'Connor informed Whitman that
                    Eldridge was going to stay at Mrs. Cooper's home in Philadelphia for several
                    days. This is undoubtedly the Hattie B. Cooper (listed in the Directory as C. H.
                    B. Cooper, "gentlewoman") who in an undated letter sent a "Christmas Greeting"
                    to Whitman. Fred Vaughan referred to who is likely a different Mrs. Cooper on
                        <a href="loc.00569">March 27, 1860</a>; the Mrs. Cooper of Vaughan's
                    letters was the mother of his roommate Robert "Bob" Cooper after Vaughan left
                    Whitman's Classon Avenue apartment. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00185_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00185_n3"><span>See note 4 in Whitman's

O'Connor
                    melodramatically implored Whitman to see Mr. Howells, "and with all the skill
                    and talent of which you are master do what you can to disenchant him with those
                    people.…If he could but know the real truth in regard to 'the great head' and
                    leader of the reform it would surely open his eyes. He evidently thinks Mr.
                    A[ndrews] a 'great light' &amp; a saint of a man, sincere and true." Joseph
                    Charles Howells, according to entries in New York Directories, must have been
                    versatile (and perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in
                    1865–1866 an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an
                    "inspector," and in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">8. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00185_n8 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00185_n8"><span>Perhaps John A. Newbould,
                    who, according to the Directory of 1863–1864, managed a hardware store in
                    New York and lived in Brooklyn. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n9">9. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00185_n9 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00185_n9"><span>Stephen Pearl Andrews
                    (1812–1886), an abolitionist and philosopher, was absorbed in utopian
                    schemes to establish a universal language, to reconcile all great thought, to
                    discover a science of the universe ("Universology"), and to institute a new
                    social order which he called Pantarchy. Trowbridge related Whitman's adverse
                    opinion of Andrews' schemes in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Independent</span>, 55
                    (1903): 497–501; note also R. A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">PMLA</span>, 63 (1948): 266, and E. C. Stedman's description of
