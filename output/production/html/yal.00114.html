                rate time—Started the next morning early in an easy comfortable palace car
                &amp; went on like a streak through New York and Pennsylvania—got into
                Philadelphia after 11 at night—(we were an hour late,)—but the city looked
                bright &amp; all alive, &amp; I felt as fresh as a lark—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am well, my summer in Canada has done me great good—it is not only the fine
                country &amp; climate there, but I found such good friends, good quarters, good
                grub, &amp; every thing that could make a man happy—</p>

                from the beautiful grass and spacious lawns there around the Asylum—for miles
                as far as the eye can reach nothing but flat gray sand &amp; the sea rolling
                in—&amp; then looking off at sea, always ships or steamers in sight out in the
                offing—I sat hours enjoying it, for it suits me—I was born &amp; brought
                up near the Sea, &amp; I could listen forever to the hoarse music of the
                surf—Tom I got your paper &amp; handbill—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">good for

                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
                    Nicholson, who was twenty-one, was an attendant in Dr. Richard Bucke's asylum
                    from April 12, 1880, to September 14, 1882. In his only extant letter to the
                    poet, on <a href="loc.00716">December 6, 1881</a>, Nicholson urged Whitman
                    to come to London, Ontario: "Every body <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">loves you</span>, and
                    you wount be no Stranger this Time." Perhaps Nicholson, or one of his friends,

                    Nicholson, were employees in Richard Bucke's hospital. Thomas Bradley, age 23,
                    served at the asylum from September 6, 1876, to April 30, 1877, when he was
                    discharged. He rejoined the staff on June 1, 1877, and was employed until April
                    30, 1882, holding such positions as mail driver, assistant baker, and messenger.
                    He again returned to the asylum on July 1, 1882, only to resign three months
                    later. Edward Batters, who was 42, worked at the hospital in 1873 and 1874,
                    until he was discharged. He was rehired in 1875 and remained until March 31,
                    1881, at which time he was a supervisor. Richard Flynn, age 24, was employed
                    from 1875 to 1885, working as a messenger, a gardener, a night watchman, and a
                    stoker. Henry O'Connor, age 22, was an attendant from August 15, 1879, until he
                    was discharged on November 12, 1880 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: The
