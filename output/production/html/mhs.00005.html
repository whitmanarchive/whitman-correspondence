            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new with me—I wrote you three days ago, to Annapolis, I suppose you got it—Jeff is away a good deal of the time, surveying &amp;c—We are having another rain-storm set in here this morning—Congress is splurging away, doing some good things too—I see Kalbfleisch &amp; Odell here frequently—have you writ to Han? Well, brother, good bye for present—</p>
