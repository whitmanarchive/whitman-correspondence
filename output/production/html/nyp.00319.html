        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Nelly:</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">About me, my ailments, no great difference. (A queer old doctor here—did I tell you?—sticks to it that, 
        although the trouble has taken the form of paralysis, &amp; instigated far back, the basic &amp; origin are of 
        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">stomachic</span> nature—at any rate the derangement &amp; suffering <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">now</span> 
        are mostly gastric &amp; liver business—telling in distress of head)—</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I went over to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil</span>​ Phil: yesterday, &amp; had a nice, good, I may almost say <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">happy</span> afternoon, with dear Mrs. Lesley, 
        Kate Hillard, &amp; the two Miss Lesleys, daughters—us four, only, no men-critters but me—I was there some four hours, 
        filled with animated talk—we had dinner, very nice, a nice glass of wine—Mrs. L. a fine gentle, sweet-voiced, 
        handsome black-eyed New England woman, (of the Lyman family, daughter of Judge Lyman.) With Miss H[illard], though the first meeting, I got along capitally—found her a jolly, hearty girl—evidently seen life &amp; folks, &amp; read lots—she talked much about the London literati, 
        &amp; the (I suppose I may say) <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">personal</span> friends of mine there, both men &amp; women, nearly all of whom she knew well, 
        giving me, among the rest, descriptions of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Personnel</span> that were new &amp; very interesting to me. She goes to Wash[ington] 
        to-morrow, to stay there (1734 I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Street​ ">st.</span>​ ) a month—reads a series of twelve papers on English poets.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I made a short call on Hector Tyndale, 1021 Clinton <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Street​ ">st</span>​ —he came down to see me, in the parlor—(I did not see Mrs. T.)—Hector did not seem much different, physically—had the tone, I thought, 
        of one who is <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">dreary</span> of life, to whom it is all an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">ennui</span>, a settled morbidity—of course that was the worst. 
        I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  a letter from Marvin to-day—from Peter Doyle yesterday—snowing here as I write—the baby fine, 
        fat, bright today, but raising his voice lustily just this moment—You got my letter three days since?
