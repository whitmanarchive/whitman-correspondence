                    1866 after the public outcry caused Swinburne's previous publisher to withdraw.
                    Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten
                    introduced such writers as James Russell Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
                    and Bret Harte to an English audience. After his death, his business was
                    purchased by Chatto &amp; Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866,
                    William Douglas O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of Whitman: "Seems
                    to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare this." Whitman
                    was dissatisfied with Hotten's work, referring to the publisher as "the English
                    pirate-publisher" and the edition as "bad &amp; defective" in a <a href="rlc.00001">January 
                    16, 1872</a>, letter to Rudolf Schmidt. For Whitman's relationship with Hotten, see Whitman's <a href="pri.00011">November 1,

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    Rossetti justified his editorial decisions, which included editing potentially
                    objectionable content and removing entire poems: "My choice has proceeded upon
                    two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every poem which could with any
                    tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or propriety in
                    this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include every remaining poem which

                    one of the first magazines to identify contributors by name rather than publish
                    their work anonymously.

                    Algernon Charles Swinburne (1837–1909) was one of Whitman's
                    earliest English admirers. At the conclusion of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Blake:
                        A Critical Essay</span> (1868), Swinburne pointed out similarities between
                    Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
                    Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
                    sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world" (300–303). His
                    famous lyric "To Walt Whitman in America" is included in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Songs
                        before Sunrise</span> (1871). For the story of Swinburne's veneration of
