                    1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
                    form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
                    with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
                    was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
                    more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    transcription at the conclusion of his section recounting his conversations with
                    Whitman in 1886: "I never corresponded with Whitman; the only communication I
                    received from him is a postal card acknowledging receipt of some money for
                    several of his books I had bought" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Conversations with Walt
                        Whitman</span>, 34). According to Edwin Haviland Miller's tabulation, based
                    upon Whitman's letters and his entries in his Commonplace Book, Whitman's income
                    in 1886 amounted to at least $2,289.06: royalties, $120.21; lectures,
                    $742.00; sales of books, $203.35; payments for articles and poems,
                    $360.00; and gifts, $863.50. (The figures on book sales are to some
                    extent conjectural, since Miller assumed that Whitman charged a uniform
                    price.) </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
