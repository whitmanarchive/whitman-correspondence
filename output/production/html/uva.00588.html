            <p class="tei_p">Curiously monotonous with me—I am still kept in the same sick room, unable to
                get out, even down stairs—don't seem to retrograde in some main
                respects—but little or no strength or the vim &amp; go that underlie all going
                &amp; doing—John Burroughs has been to see me, the dear
                good fellow, I was glad to have him, &amp; his talk did me good—he is not very
                well, is troubled with persistent insomnia—works at physical labor (on his own
                land)—not much of late seasons on essay or book making—I had a letter
                day before yesterday from O Connor—he has great trouble
                with an affection of the eyes—one lid remains fallen, &amp; the other eye
                sympathises with it—seems to be at his desk in the Life Saving Service office
                daily—I hear f'm Dr Bucke" every day or so—T B
                    Harned was here an hour ago—is well &amp;
                busy—Horace Traubel is faithful to the utmost—I
                have not heard a word from Dr Knortz ab't that German
                translation being printed by publisher Schabelitz, Zurich Switzerland (I believe I
                told you Rolleston in Ireland sent me word he had rec'd first
                proofs)—I forward with this mail a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November
                    Boughs</span>—McKay will be the publisher this coming
                week—What has become of the W W plaster bust? Has it gone to Concord—or
                is going? Sidney Morse is in Chicago—I remain in fair spirits &amp;
                comfortable—am just going to have my dinner (I live neither abstemiously nor
                generously, two meals a day)—Splendid sunny October day—rather
                quiet—Love to you &amp; yours—</p>
