                    journalist and friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the
                    Civil War. Swinton, managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                    Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman.
                    Whitman's correspondence with Swinton began on <a href="bos.00006">February
                        23, 1863</a>. Swinton's enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On <a href="loc.01955">September 25, 1868</a>, Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly
                    impressed with the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you.
                    I read this afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never
                    before read. I could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more
                    to me than all other books and poetry." On <a href="loc.01957">June 23,
                        1874</a>, Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter":
                    "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the
                    'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street,
                    Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something
                    that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me,
                    grown around me, and grown into me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
                    36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
                    for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the
                    weekly labor journal, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Swinton's Paper</span>. When this
                    publication folded, he returned to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. See Robert
                    Waters, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Career and Conversation of John Swinton</span> (Chicago:

                    (1841–1899) was a noted journalist in Philadelphia, New York, and
                    Washington, D.C. A Pennsylvania native, he began writing at the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> at age seventeen and was named a managing editor in
                    1862. After serving as a war journalist during the Civil War, he moved to New
                    York in 1865 to work at the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>, which he
                    edited from 1866 to 1868. In 1870 he established his own newspaper, the New York
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Standard</span>. In 1877, he was invited to accompany
                    President Ulysses S. Grant on a world tour; Young published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Around the World with General Grant</span>, a two-volume account of the tour,
                    in 1879. Young's knowledge of the Chinese language earned him the position of
                    the American ambassador to China from 1882 to 1885. He became the seventh
                    Librarian of Congress in 1897 and served until his death. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Men and Memories</span> (New York, F. Tennyson Neely, 1901), a posthumous
                    collection of Young's personal reminiscences, his editor and wife, May Dow
                    Russell Young writes: "A deep and genuine affection existed between Walt Whitman
                    and John Russell Young, the result of many years' acquaintance and profound
                    admiration" (76). The collection includes Young's account of reading the first
                    edition of  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and later meeting Whitman in
                    Washington, D.C. (76–109). For more information, see John C. Broderick,
