            <p class="tei_p">To celebrate your seventieth birthday, I your grateful and devoted admirer, have
                written some words of sympathy and congratulation, and published them in the issue
                of June 2nd of the paper I am editing just now, viz. the 'Deutsche Presse,' the
                official organ of the league of German authors (Deutschen Schriftsteller-Verband).<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">1</a> I
                trust I may be able some day to devote to you and your work a serious essay
                better suited to do justice to your genius than was possible in that aphoristic
                article. However, those few lines will at least serve as an unambiguous testimony of
                my deep and true devotion to you, and as it may give you pleasure to hear of an
                unknown German friend of yours, I take the liberty to send you that birthday paper,
                hoping you will look upon it in kind and indulgent eyes.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a></p>
