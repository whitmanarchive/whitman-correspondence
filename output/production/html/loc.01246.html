            <p class="tei_p">After a splendid time in Ceylon &amp; India I have got back here again. Saw much of the interior 
                life of the people, religious customs, &amp;c—spent one night, or a good part of one, in a 
                Hindu Temple during a festival—saw a little of the peasantry &amp; their ways, and made 
                several friends among the natives. Altogether it is very interesting—the old occult knowledge 
                (some of a very remarkable character) lingering on among certain sections; then the

                tremendous Westernising movement among other sections, towards education science, &amp; commercialism, 
                and away from caste &amp; religion; caste itself, such an intricate &amp; stupendous affair, impossible 
                to get to know more than the fringe of it; the evident rapprochement between The East &amp; The West, 
                and yet the deep &amp; vital differences between them, in temperament &amp; almost everything—altogether
                it has given me a lot to think about!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I got a pamphlet from D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Johnston of Bolton about his visit 
                to you—wh. I enjoyed—also a capital photograph. His account in the pamphlet and in a recent

                letter about your health, dear Walt, is not very good—this long confinement to the house, together 
                with gastric troubles, must weary you at times—It does make such a difference when one can get 
                out—and yet there doesn't seem much difference in you, exc: quite outwardly.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Some of us (Bessie &amp; Isabella Ford; R.D. Roberts of Cambridge; William, Arthur 
                &amp; Ethel Thompson; and myself) are sending on to you our usual birthday 
                remembrance—with our love and unchanged affection (I think I may say). The letter of credit, enclosed, 
                is for £40. I don't quite know what "identification" they require; but I don't think you will have any

                difficulty about the matter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William Thompson is lately married &amp; is working a little at bookbinding for a trade. Arthur &amp; Ethel 
                are his brother &amp; sister, whom I know next to nothing of. The two Miss Fords have been down with influenza, 
                but are mending again I believe. Herbert Gilchrist I hear is on Long Island.

                when you see them. I send you a bit of sweet briar wh. grows by the door of this little house. Our garden goes 
                on much the same, and all seems homelike &amp; pleasant after my long absence—the bees humming in the sun
                as if the world had only just begun! I hope you will have a pleasant birthday gathering, dear Walt—</p>
