            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs of yesterday rec'd—I suppose you gave my
                letter &amp; enclosures to Col. I[ingersoll] as I meant them
                (especially the enc's) to get to him—Yes, dear friend, I too think with pride
                (&amp; something more, if there is any thing more) of having Ingersoll go on
                permanent record on L of G.—have no sharper regret than the passing away
                unrecorded of the Reisser speech in Phila:—I don't
                believe either Ing: or any of you realize how inimitable &amp; perfect it was.</p>
