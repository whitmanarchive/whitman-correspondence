                    Whitman from London on <a href="loc.01118">October 3–4, 1871</a>,
                    after he had visited St. Paul's, where he had a staggering revelation, not
                    unlike Henry James's in a Parisian gallery: "I saw for the first time what power
                    &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I felt for a moment
                    what great genius was in this field.…I had to leave them &amp; sit
                    down.…My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these
                    things all at once…It is like the grandest organ music put into form."
                    Whitman wrote in the margin: "Splendid off hand letter from John
                    Burroughs—? publish it." On <a href="loc.01882">October 8, 1871</a>,
                    William Michael Rossetti referred to a visit three days earlier from Burroughs:
                    "I like his frank manly aspect &amp; tone." Burroughs visited Dowden in November

                    <p class="tei_p">In his letter of <a href="loc.01489">September 5, 1871</a>, Dowden
                        cited a number of Dublin admirers, and concluded: "One thing strikes me
                        about everyone who cares for what you write—while your attraction is
                        most absolute, &amp; the impression you make as powerful as that of any
                        teacher or vates, you do not rob the mind of its independence, or divert it
                        from its true direction. You make no slaves, however many lovers."</p>
