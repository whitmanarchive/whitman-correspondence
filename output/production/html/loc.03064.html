            <p class="tei_p">I have your postal card of yesterday. I send you a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> of Sunday, as I see by your card that up to

            <p class="tei_p">Tucker has fairly cowed Stevens &amp; Co in Boston. My private advices are very amusing. Pity Osgood was such a craven, though better for you.</p>
