               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff's letter of the 11th, acknowledging the books, also the one about five days previous, containing the $10 from Van Anden, came safe.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> Jeff's letters are always first rate and welcome—the good long one with so much about home, and containing Han's &amp; George's, was especially so. It is a great pleasure, though sometimes a melancholy one, to hear from Han, under her own hand. I have writ to George—I wrote last Friday—I directed the letter to "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lexington</span> or elsewhere, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kentucky</span>"—as I saw in a letter in a Cincinnati paper that Gen. Ferrero<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> was appointed provost marshal at Lexington—the 51st is down there somewhere, and I guess it is about as well off there as anywhere—there is much said about their closing up the regimental companies—that is, where there are ten companies of 40 men each, closing them up to five companies, of 80 men each. It is said the government purposes something of this kind—it will throw a good many captains &amp; lieutenants out—I suppose you know that LeGendre<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> is now Col. of the 51st—it's a pity if we havn't Americans enough to put over our old war regiments—(I think less and less of foreigners, in this war—what I see, especially in the hospitals, convinces me that there is no other stock, for emergencies, but native American—no other name by which we can be saved.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I feel quite bad about Andrew<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—I am so in hopes to hear that he has recovered—I think about him every day—he must not get fretting and disheartened—that is really the worst feature of any sickness—diseases of the throat and bronchia are the result always of bad state of the stomach, blood, &amp;c. (they never come from the throat itself)—the throat and bronchia are lined like the stomach and other interior organs with a fine lining like silk or crape, and when all this gets ulcerated or inflamed or what not, (it is Dr. Sammis's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">mucous membrane</span>, you know,) it is bad, and most distressing—medicine is really of no great account, except just to pacify a person—this lining I speak of is full of little blood vessels, and the way to make a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">real cure</span> is by gentle and steady means to recuperate the whole system—this will tell upon the blood, upon the blood vessels, and so finally &amp; effectually upon all this coating I speak of that lines the throat &amp;c. But as it is a long time before this vital lining membrane (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very important</span>) is injured, so it is a long time before it can be made all healthy &amp; right again—but Andrew is young &amp; strong enough and good constitution for basis—&amp; of course by regular diet, care, (&amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">nary whiskey</span> under any circumstances) I am sure he would not only get over that trouble, but be as well &amp; strong as he ever was in his life. Mother, you tell him I sent him my love, and Nancy the same, and the dear little boys the same. The next time you or Mat goes down there you take this &amp; show him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mat, I am quite glad to hear that you are not hurried &amp; fretted with work from New York this spring—I am sure I should think sis &amp; housekeeping &amp;c would be enough to attend to. I was real amused with sis's remarks, and all that was in the letter about her. You must none of you notice her smartness, nor criticisms, before her, nor encourage her to spread herself nor be critical, as it is not good to encourage a child to be too sharp—and I hope sissy is going to be a splendid specimen of good animal health—for the few years to come I should think more of that than any thing—that is the foundation of all, (righteousness included)—as to her mental vivacity &amp; growth, they are plenty enough of themselves, and will get along quite fast enough of themselves, plenty fast enough—don't stimulate them at all—dear little creature, how I should like to see her this minute—Jeff must not make his lessons to her in music any ways strong or frequent on any account—two lessons a week, of ten minutes each, is enough—But then I dare say Jeff will think of all these things, just the same as I am saying.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff writes he wonders if I am as well and hearty, and I suppose he means as much of a beauty as ever—whether I look the same<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—well, not only as much, but more so—I believe I weigh about 200 and as to my face, (so scarlet,) and my beard and neck, they are terrible to behold—I fancy the reason I am able to do some good in the hospitals, among the poor languishing &amp; wounded boys, is that I am so large and well—indeed like a great wild buffalo, with much hair—many of the soldiers are from the west, and far north—and they take to a man that has not the bleached shiny &amp; shaved cut of the cities and the east. I spent three to four hours yesterday in Armory Hospital—One of my particular boys there was dying,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> pneumonia—he wanted me to stop with him awhile—he could not articulate—but the look of his eyes, and the holding on of his hand, was deeply affecting. His case is a relapse—eight days ago, he had recovered, was up, was perhaps a little careless—at any rate took cold, was taken down again and has sunk rapidly. He has no friends or relatives here—Yesterday he labored &amp; panted so for breath, it was terrible—he is a young man from New England, from the country—I expect to see his cot vacated this afternoon or evening, as I shall go down then. Mother, if you or Mat was here a couple of days, you would cry your eyes out. I find I have to restrain myself and keep my composure—I succeed pretty well. Good bye, dearest mother.</p>

            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, my last letter home was a week ago to-day—We are having a dark rainy day here—it is now ½ past 3—I have been in my room all day, so far—shall have dinner in ½ an hour, and then down to Armory.</p>

                    from <a href="loc.00406">April 6, 1863</a>, Jeff included $10 from
                    Isaac Van Anden (1812–1875), the founder of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn

                    1846–47, but left after a political disagreement with the proprietor; see

                    business and they are too cursed costly to buy." By April 11, 1863, he had
                    received two books: "I am extremely obliged . . . and shall, Oliver Twist like,
                    ask for more" (see Jeff's letter to Walt dated <a href="loc.00407">April 11,

                    soldier who helped to recruit the Fifty-first New York Volunteer Infantry.
                    LeGendre was severely wounded at New Bern, North Carolina, on March 14, 1862, as
                    George observed in his letter of March 16–18,1862, to his mother, Lousia
                    Van Velsor Whitman (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
                    Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). LeGendre was appointed lieutenant
                    colonel on September 20, 1862, and later succeeded Edward Ferrero (see Walt's
                    letter to his mother from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>) and
                    Robert B. Potter (see Walt's letter from <a href="loc.00772">May 26,
                        1863</a>) as commanding officer of the Fifty-first Regiment. During the
                    second Battle of the Wilderness, May 6, 1864, he lost his left eye and the
                    bridge of his nose, and was honorably discharged on October 4 of the same year.

                    "Andrew had been discharged from the [navy] yard. Tis too bad but I presume it
                    is on account of his not being there much of the
                    time." This was but the first of the
                    disasters that befell Andrew in 1863. In a letter from <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, Jeff noted that Andrew's health was poor, and that the
                    doctor had advised him to stop drinking and "to work
                    out-doors." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00766_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00766_n5"><span>In a letter to Walt dated
                        <a href="loc.00407">April 11, 1863</a>, Jeff, like a typical father,
                    boasted of Mannahatta's verbal ability: "Yesterday one of the Hearkness children
                    was in our rooms and they were talking about rolling their hoops, one told
                    sis—4½ yrs old—that she had rolled her hoop down the 'teet'; sis
                    says 'I rolled mine down the street, thats the way to say it'." On <a href="loc.00406">April 6, 1863</a>, Jeff wrote: "Every day I give her a
                    little exercise in singing, two or three notes only. I think she could be made a
                    fine musician and am going to try it." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00766_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00766_n6"><span>Also in the <a href="loc.00406">April 6, 1863</a>, letter Jeff wrote: "Walt, how I
                    should like to see you, do you look the same as ever or has the immense number
                    of unfortunate and heart-working cases given you an sober and melancholy look."
                     Whitman always endeavored to allay
                    Jeff's fears. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00766_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00766_n7"><span>Whitman might be

                    Whitman spent most of his time in Armory Square Hospital because, he wrote on
                    June 30, "it contains by far the worst cases" (see Walt's letter to Louisa Van

                    [Washington, D.C.: A. O. P. Nicholson, 1860]). When Whitman met Mullan, Mullan
                    was about to publish his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Report on the Construction of a

                    Government Publications Office, 1863). In a notebook entry for April 1863
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #76), Whitman referred to both of these reports. In a letter to his
                    mother from <a href="loc.00765">March 31, 1863</a>, Walt had praised
                    "Capt. Mullin, U.S. Army (engineer), who has been six years out in the Rocky
                    Mt's, making a gov't road, 650 miles from Ft. Benton to Walla Walla—very,
                    very interesting to know such men intimately, and talk freely with them." A
                    transcontinental railroad had long fascinated Whitman; he later wrote an
                    editorial on the subject in 1858 while he was editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Times</span> (see Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    celebrated the completion of the railroad in his poem, "Passage to
