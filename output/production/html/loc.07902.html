                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    final illness. Carol J. Singley reports that "Longaker enjoyed talking with
