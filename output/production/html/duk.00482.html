                the matrass she sleeps on, made over, at a cost of $6.<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">50</span>—It

                help her—come to see her—send her money, or send it to Dr 
                Bringham— but it will come safe if sent to her through mail—she
                looks pitifull—does not sleep well. Brahma roosters make 
                such discord at early morning—and men currying horses—and

                wear pants—the same for three years—growing old of course—have nice
