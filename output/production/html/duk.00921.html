                regularly—thanks—Nothing very different with me—Still
                imprison'd—my dilapidation not mending (slowly gradually worse if any thing,
                but not much change)—am preparing my (to me) most satisfactory new really
                complete ed'n L of G. including "Sands" and epilogue "Glance"—will send you one—Am sitting here in the big
                chair sort o' comfortable—alone all day—O'C[onnor]
                still very sick—Dr B[ucke] well &amp; busy—</p>
