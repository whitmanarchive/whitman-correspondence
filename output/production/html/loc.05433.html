            <p class="tei_p">I received your welcome epistle some weeks since,<a href="#n5002d" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5002d">2</a> and was pleased to find you had not

                come.—You may imagine how fortunate this decision of mine is for the people
                here. Of course as long as these diggins are irradiated by the presence of your humble servant,
                a double amount of splendor in things spiritual, moral, and intellectual, is
                bestowed upon the residents thereof.—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see by the papers that Overacre<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> has opened a "Children's

                    would go on to become a bookkeeper and friend of Walt Whitman. Leech also served
                    as secretary pro tem of The Jamaica Lyceum in the 1840s in Jamaica, New York. He
                    and his wife, Phebe Kissam Duryea Leech (1823–1885) had two children:

                    Jamaica, Long Island, New York in 1840, and he started "The Children's Retreat"
                    for Home Education. An advertisement for Overacre's educational program appeared
                    in the April 13, 1841, issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New York Tribune</span>, and
                    indicated that Overacre would receive a limited number of boys under twelve
                    years of age into his family, to "effect a thorough training of the faculties; a
                    seasonable and harmonious development of the moral, physical, and intellectual
                    powers." The ad also indicated that Overacre's "mode of discipline [was]
                    strictly parental," and that the Bible would be the primary source of "religious
                    principle and moral duty" ("Home Education," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New York
                        Tribune</span> [April 13, 1841], 3). Given that Overacre's "Children's
                    Retreat" is advertised in mid-April 1841 and Whitman mentions having seen papers
                    that printed news about the school, this letter almost certainly dates to May 4,
                    1841. Later, Jacob Overacre is listed as a teacher at the Mechanics' Institute
                    School in the 1851 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Manual of the Corporation of the City of
                        New York</span> and, according to the state census, still resided in Brooklyn
                    as a schoolteacher in 1865. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.05433_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.05433_n3"><span>Whitman may be making a
                    reference to the Bible; see Acts, Chapter 2, verse 3, in which the Holy Spirit's
                    presence is felt at Pentecost, and followers of Jesus see tongues of fire,
                    symbols of the various langauges in which they were to preach the Gospel. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
