            <p class="tei_p">Enclosed a little piece the whole idea of which I got from you—as you see. It
                is in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> of Sept. 27—Dry and warm and
                often oppressive weather here—a long spell—My lameness seems permanent
                like—I have promised to write a War Hospital Article for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> to supplement
                their forthcoming swell [of] war narratives by Grant &amp; the rest.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William, I wonder if you or Charles Eldridge couldn't help me to something there from
                the Medical Bureau—summaries, or statistics or any information—who do
                you know in the Surgeon Gen[eral]'s office?</p>
