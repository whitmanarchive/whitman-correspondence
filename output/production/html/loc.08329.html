                    (1832–1904) was a British writer and editor best known for his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> and over 6,000 leading articles for the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Telegraph</span> (Mary Ellis Gibson, ed., "Sir Edwin
                    Arnold," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Anglophone Poetry in Colonial India,
                        1780–1913</span> [Athens: Ohio University Press, 2011], 259–260).
                    He visited Whitman in 1889 and in 1891. For an account of Arnold's 1889 visit,
                    see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Thursday, September 12, 1889</a> and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.157.html">Saturday, September 14, 1889</a>. There are at least two additional
                    accounts of this visit; "Arnold and Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Times</span> (Philadelphia, PA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00519.html">September 15, 1889</a>, and a different article, also titled "Arnold and
                    Whitman" was published anonymously in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Daily Picayune</span>
                    (New Orleans, LA) on <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00637.html">September 26, 1889</a>. Arnold also paid a surprise visit to Whitman in
                    Camden on November 2, 1891. An account of the visit was published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Press</span> with the title "A Poet's Greetings to
                    a Poet." See Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    Traubel described the account of Whitman's visit with Arnold as "almost
                    idiotic—certainly foolish." See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Springfield

                    Whitman had come down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his
                    right lung. Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would
                    never recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel
                    Longaker of Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care
                    during his final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4b">back</a>]</li></ul>
