        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your second letter, with sad news—following the sad, sad, inexpressibly sad news of
        the first—has just reached me. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I will not write any of the usual condolences. Chancy's malady
        &amp; death seem to be of those events sometimes mocking with unaccountable sudden tragedies
        &amp; cross–purposes, all of us, &amp; all our affairs. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have again had some pretty bad spells, (gastric &amp; brain)—but am decidedly better as I write, &amp; for a day or two past—Shall
        come—Will write again soon—</p>
