                    visited Whitman in March 1874 and wrote to his uncle on March 29, 1874: "It
                    seemed hard to see the great man afflicted, bowed down, and I could not suppress
                    my tears, and cannot suppress them now. . . . His death would be a heavy, heavy
                    blow to me. Oh, Uncle John, I can't think of it without crying, as I do now"

                    described a visit to Dr. Grier on June 2, 1874: "He reiterated his theory that
                    my sufferings, (later ones) come nearly altogether from gastric, stomachic,
                    intestinal, non-excretory, &amp;c. causes, causing flatulence, a very great
                    distension of the colon, of passages, weight on valves, crowding &amp; pressing
                    on organs (heart, lungs, &amp;c) and the very great distress &amp; pain I have
                    been under in breast &amp; left side, &amp; pit of stomach, &amp; thence to my
                    head, the last month. Advised me by all means to begin the use of an injection
                    syringe, (Fountain No. 2. tepid water for clysters)—was favorable to my
                    using whiskey—advised assa[feti]da pills, 2 ? kneading the bowel[s] . . ."
