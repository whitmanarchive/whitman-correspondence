                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate
                        of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical</span> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    with Marvin, who had gone to England on official business (see Whitman's <a href="nyp.00372">December 16, 1875</a> letter to John Burroughs). On
                        <a href="loc.01885">December 23, 1875</a>, William Michael Rossetti
                    described to Walt Whitman a dinner he gave for Marvin which was attended by the

                    which Conway reported that Walt Whitman had given up hope of recovery, on <a href="loc.02885">December 4, 1875</a>, Gilchrist implored: "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dont give up that hope</span>, for the sake of those that so
                    tenderly passionately love you." She promised to come to America as soon as
                    Percy was married. Meanwhile, on October 19, 1875, Gilchrist had written to
                    Burroughs to inform him that Walt Whitman's English admirers were preparing
                    "some tangible embodiment however inadequate" to relieve the poet's financial
                    needs (Boston Public Library; Clifton Joseph Furness, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
