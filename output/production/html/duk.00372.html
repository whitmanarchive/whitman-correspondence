                    Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in
                    Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
                    corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
                    1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the
                    correspondence was renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On
                    March 5, 1875, Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old
                    Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the
                    days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter,
                    on August 16, 1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for
                    California. Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection. He is
                    mentioned in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During the War</span> (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span>, 10 vols. [New
                    York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134). When Bucke wrote to Farwell after Walt
                    Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the back of a
                    circular," was extant (Miller). For Farwell's other correspondence with Whitman
