            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 16th rec'd—Although delayed from calling upon you by one or two little
                matters, I still entertain your proposals—I have had several—For one
                point I should like some publishing &amp; radiating spot near my own
                locality—for another to retain control of my book &amp; personally advise in
                selling &amp; publishing it—Will call upon you Monday bet'n 11 and
                12—</p>
