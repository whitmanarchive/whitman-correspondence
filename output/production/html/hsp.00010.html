            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 16th rec'd—Although delayed from calling upon you by one or two little
                matters, I still entertain your proposals—I have had several—For one
                point I should like some publishing &amp; radiating spot near my own
                locality—for another to retain control of my book &amp; personally advise in
                selling &amp; publishing it—Will call upon you Monday bet'n 11 and
                12—</p>

                <p class="tei_p">What would you say to entering decidedly into the publishing field? Haven't you
                    thought of it? I want to publish my <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Prose writings</span> in a
                    companion volume to L of G—Then there is a Canada man who has a

                    doubtless have issued it but for the flurry.)—Making <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">three Volumes</span> that ought to go out together, from the same house &amp;
                    hands—</p>
