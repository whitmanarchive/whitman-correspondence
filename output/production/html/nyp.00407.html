            <p class="tei_p">I supposed you rec'd a paper from me lately with an acc't of some of my movements &amp;c. here, as I sent you one—I had no idea of staying so long when I left 13th June—thought only of staying a couple of days—[but then?] it will be most a month soon—But I shall return to Camden next Tuesday—or Wednesday at furthest—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My darling boy, I want to see you very much, &amp; I know you do me too—Harry, I meet many, many friends here, some very fine folks—some tip-top young men too—&amp; there is no end to hospitality, &amp; places to visit &amp;c.—everybody seems to know me—it is quite funny sometimes—but I believe I am as contented down by the old pond as any where—(I wish I was there this afternoon—at least for a couple of hours)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I see Hunter<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> was convicted—we will see now whether he is hung—I see an item in the paper that [Emma?] Bethel had confessed to poisoning the Bishops—I will finish my letter &amp; send it off to-morrow—</p>
