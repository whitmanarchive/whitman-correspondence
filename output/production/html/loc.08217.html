                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    suspicions that he had written plays under the pen-name William Shakespeare in

                    Francis Bacon. Bucke also mentions his longing to discuss the subject with
                    Whitman's friend and defender William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), a Baconian

                    was a close acquaintance of Walt Whitman and one of the poet's literary

                    daily beginning in the late 1880s. The result of these meetings—during which
                    Traubel took meticulous notes—is the nine-volume collection <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/index.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></span>. Later in life, Traubel also
                    published Whitmanesque poetry and revolutionary essays. He died in 1919, shortly
                    after he claimed to have seen a vision of Whitman beckoning him to 'Come on'.

                    he also wanted to be able to present copies to his friends. A version of the
                    1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, often referred to as the
                    "deathbed edition," was bound in December of 1891 so that Whitman could give the
                    volume to friends at Christmas. The following year, the 1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Phildelphia publisher
                    David McKay. This volume reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex consisted of a long prefatory essay
                    entitled "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" and sixty-five poems; while the
                    second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection of thirty-one short poems taken
                    from the gathering of prose and poetry published under that title by McKay in
