            <p class="tei_p">I returned last evening from a jaunt to the country—feel middling well again (about half-&amp;-half)—after a bad spell during March &amp; most of April—thought I was going to have a relapse to my old state, but the doctors say it was either only or mostly a bad case of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">rheumatism</span>—(the best point about which seems to be that if it be ever so bad a devil itself, it generally keeps the coast clear of all other devils)—However, I am better at this writing, &amp; look forward to a tolerably fair summer—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The "Poetry of America" arrived, &amp; I am well content &amp; pleased with the part I am made to bear in it—Surely you have made a capital compilation &amp; condensation—the best thing of its sort &amp; size I have seen—</p>
       
            <p class="tei_p">Our friends the Gilchrists have broken camp in Philadelphia, &amp; gone (more or less temporarily) to Northampton, Mass:—You will probably soon hear from (perhaps see) Herbert, the artist, the son—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose a little printed slip—(or did I send it you before?)—Since my late sick spell, it is not so likely the programme will be carried out—but I want to go about somewhat this summer—</p>
