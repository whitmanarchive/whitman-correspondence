            <p class="tei_p">J. E. Chamberlain (of Transcript—The "Listener") 
                tells me Rhys is married! Rhys sent him a paper abt it. If I can get it will send
                to you. If Rhys sent you one be sure to send it to me, please. So glad Dr B is around again. I met Chamberlain
                in street carrying on his arm a lovely little blossom of a girl 2 or 3 yrs old. He
                introduced me to his wife &amp; another five-year-old girl (pretty little) was
                across the street. I think he is just now moving fr. Medford
                over to the Wellesley Hills Region. He has bought or rented there. Am real sad for
                that depression &amp; lassitude. Bear up against it all you can.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am feasting on Shakespeare (pocket Ed<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">n</span>) this winter,—by scraps, read on cars. I have
                terrible depressing colds—throat trouble, all this winter. Steam heat &amp;
                reading aloud so much are the causes.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wonderful things going on in medicine &amp; science these days aint there?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Am still on the search for the Booths' ancestry. Have climbed to top of
                    Athenaeum twice for a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Galaxy</span> which was out.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I might have added to my list of great Holland–born men Beethoven. He was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Van</span> Beethoven. But not much is known of his
                Dutchness. And what a galaxy of eminent scientists in Holland!</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Liked Traubel's elaborate article 
                    very much. 'Twas very good of him to do so
                    studiedly well on it. His diction is surprisingly
                    good "times." Beats any of mine. But—his thought is often clouded by a
                    strained originality of expression. I think when he forgets to try to write
                    greatly he writes best.</p>
