            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing special to write about, yet I will send you a line. I wrote to Nelly between two &amp; three weeks ago—with a line to you and Charles Eldridge—which I suppose came all right at the time. I have been having a comfortable time, absolutely doing nothing, sleeping a good deal, eating &amp; drinking what suits me, and going out a few hours a day, a good part of the time on the water. Mother has had an attack of illness, somewhat severe, the last few days—&amp; I have been sort of nurse &amp; doctor—(as none of my sisters are home at present)—result is that Mother is very much better this morning—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wednesday's brush in N. Y. you have seen in the papers—in five sixths of the city, it was curiously almost unfelt, every thing went on the same—30 or 40 killed and a hundred wounded—yet it all falls very languidly on our people—we have supped full of horror of late years—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Policemen</span> looked &amp; behaved splendidly—I have been looking on them &amp; been with them much, &amp; am refreshed by their presence—it is something new—in some respects they afford the most encouraging sign I have got—brown, bearded, worn, resolute, American-looking men, dusty &amp; sweaty—looked like veterans—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">stock</span> here even in these cities is in the main magnificent—the heads either shysters, villains or impotents—Love to Nelly, Charles Eldridge &amp; Jeannie—</p>
