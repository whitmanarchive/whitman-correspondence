            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing special to write about, yet I will send you a line. I wrote to Nelly between two &amp; three weeks ago<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—with a line to you and Charles Eldridge—which I suppose came all right at the time. I have been having a comfortable time, absolutely doing nothing, sleeping a good deal, eating &amp; drinking what suits me, and going out a few hours a day, a good part of the time on the water. Mother has had an attack of illness, somewhat severe, the last few days—&amp; I have been sort of nurse &amp; doctor—(as none of my sisters are home at present)—result is that Mother is very much better this morning—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wednesday's brush in N.

                    journal devoted two full pages (in an eight-page issue) to the incident, and
                    announced that 45 had been killed and 105 wounded. Whitman also wrote of the
