But I take back my promise. For if you are not sane what will writing avail? and if you are sane your writings are alive with richest sanity. Now, if I do not understand them, or any parts of them, what good will it do to say soâ€”silence, it seems to me, is a duty till I do understand them; and then again, if I do understand them, or <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">when</span> I shall do so, what good will it do to tell you of the fact? It is a waste of breath for my friend to tell me I am healthy when my pulse records the circumstance so often every minute.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">I love you, Walt! A Conquering Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp. Ever and truly</p>
