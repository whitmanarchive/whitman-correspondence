                    (1810–1876) was a German poet and translator and friend of Henry Wadsworth
                    Longfellow. His review in the Augsburg <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Allgemeinen
                        Zeitung</span> on April 24, 1868 (reprinted in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Gesammelte Dichtungen</span> [Stuttgart: G. J. Göschen, 1871],
                    4:86–89), was among the first notices of Walt Whitman's poetry on the
                    continent. (A translation of the article appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New
                        Eclectic Magazine</span>, 2 [July 1868], 325–329; see also Gay Wilson
                    Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Abroad</span> [Syracuse: Syracuse University
                    Press, 1955], 3–7.) Freiligrath had promised his readers "some translated
                    specimens of the poet's productions," not a complete translation. A sympathetic
                    article on Whitman in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sontagsblatt</span> of
                    November 1, 1868, mentioned Freiligrath's admiration for the American poet. A
                    translation of this article, which Whitman had a Washington friend prepare, is
                    now in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_har.00054_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="har.00054_n2"><span>William D. O'Connor acted as

                    Freiligrath to follow a package Whitman sent to Freiligrath on November 11,
                    1868. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
