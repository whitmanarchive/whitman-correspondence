      <p class="tei_p">The bearer of this note is Col. Richard J. Hinton, of this city (though English by birth), 
        a friend of mine, who calls to make your acquaintance.</p>

        <p class="tei_p">I have been very ill, from paralysis, but am recovering.</p>
        
        <p class="tei_p">Your books (two sets) reached me safely, and gave me great pleasure. I am perfectly satisfied 
          with the selections from my poems—and feel grateful to you for your kindness to me throughout 
          the books. I do not forget you. I will write again when I feel well. My address remains the same—Solicitor's Office, Treasury, here.</p>
