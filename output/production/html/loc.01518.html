                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete—</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been very sick the last three days—I dont know what to call it—it makes me prostrated 
                &amp; deathly weak, &amp; little use of my limbs.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> I have thought of you, my darling boy, very much of the time. 
                I have not been out of the house since the first day after my arrival. I had a pleasant journey 
                through on the cars Wednesday afternoon &amp; night—felt quite well then. My Mother &amp; folks are all well. 
                We are in our new house—we occupy part &amp; rent out part. I have a nice room, where I now sit writing this. 
                It is the latter part of the afternoon. I feel better the last hour or so. It has been extremely hot here 
                the last two days—I see it has been so in Washington too. I hope I shall get out soon. 
                I hanker to get out doors, &amp; down the bay.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And now, dear Pete, for yourself. How is it with you, dearest boy—and is there any thing different with the face?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> Dear Pete, you must forgive me for being so cold the last day &amp; evening. 
                I was unspeakably shocked and repelled from you by that talk &amp; proposition of yours—you know what—there by the fountain. It seemed indeed to me, (for I will talk out 
                plain to you, dearest comrade,) that the one I loved, and who had always been so manly 
                &amp; sensible, was gone, &amp; a fool &amp; intentional murderer stood in his place. 
                I spoke so sternly &amp; cutting. (Though I see now that my words might have appeared 
                to have a certain other meaning, which I didn't dream of, insulting to you, never for 
                one moment in my thoughts.) But I will say no more of this—for I know such thoughts must 
                have come when you was not yourself, but in a moment of derangement—&amp; have passed away like a bad dream.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dearest boy, I have not a doubt but you will get well, and entirely well—&amp; we will one day look back on these drawbacks &amp; sufferings as things long past. 
                The extreme cases of that malady, (as I told you before) are persons that have very 
                deeply diseased blood, probably with syphilis in it, inherited from parentage, 
                &amp; confirmed by themselves—so they have no foundation to build on. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">You</span> are of healthy stock, 
                with a sound constitution, &amp; good blood—&amp; I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">know</span> it is impossible for it to continue long. 
                My darling, if you are not well when I come back I will get a good room or two in some quiet place, 
                (or out of Washington, perhaps in Baltimore,) and we will live together, &amp; devote ourselves 
                altogether to the job of curing you, &amp; rooting the cursed thing out entirely, 
                &amp; making you stronger &amp; healthier than ever. I have had this in my mind before, 
                but never broached it to you. I could go on with my work in the Attorney General's office 
                just the same—&amp; we would see that your mother should have a small sum every week to keep the pot a-boiling at home.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear comrade, I think of you very often. My love for you is indestructible, 
                &amp; since that night &amp; morning has returned more than before.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Pete, dear son, my darling boy, my young &amp; loving brother, don't let the devil 
                put such thoughts in your mind again—wickedness unspeakable—murder, death &amp; disgrace here, 
                &amp; hell's agonies hereafter<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—Then what would it be afterward to the mother? What to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">me</span>?—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete, I send you some money, by Adam's Express—you use it, dearest son, &amp; when it is gone, 
                you shall have some more, for I have plenty. I will write again before long—give my love to Johnny Lee,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> my dear darling boy, I love him truly—(let him read these three last lines)—Dear Pete, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">remember</span>—</p>

                    begun to deteriorate; he had written about a "severe cold" with "bad spells [of]
                    dizziness" in his <a href="nyp.00289">February 2–8, 1869</a> letter
                    to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Yet in his puff in the Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sunday Chronicle</span> on May 9, 1869, Walt Whitman had written
                    about himself: "On the verge of becoming half a centenarian, he retains his
                    accustomed health, eats his rations regularly, and keeps his weight well toward
                    190 pounds"; reprinted in Emory Holloway, "Whitman as His Own Press Agent," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American Mercury</span> 18 (1929), 482. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01518_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01518_n2"><span>According to Dr. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke, Doyle was suffering a skin eruption popularly known as "barber's
                    itch" and was taken by Whitman to Dr. Charles Bowen for treatment; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span> [New York: G.P.
                    Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:40–41n. Doyle's suicidal response to the skin
                    irritation was undoubtedly associated with deep-seated feelings of guilt. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01518_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01518_n3"><span>In this uncharacteristic
