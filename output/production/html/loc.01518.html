                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete—</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been very sick the last three days—I dont know what to call it—it makes me prostrated 
                &amp; deathly weak, &amp; little use of my limbs. I have thought of you, my darling boy, very much of the time. 
                I have not been out of the house since the first day after my arrival. I had a pleasant journey 
                through on the cars Wednesday afternoon &amp; night—felt quite well then. My Mother &amp; folks are all well. 
                We are in our new house—we occupy part &amp; rent out part. I have a nice room, where I now sit writing this. 
                It is the latter part of the afternoon. I feel better the last hour or so. It has been extremely hot here 
                the last two days—I see it has been so in Washington too. I hope I shall get out soon. 
                I hanker to get out doors, &amp; down the bay.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">And now, dear Pete, for yourself. How is it with you, dearest boy—and is there any thing different with the face? Dear Pete, you must forgive me for being so cold the last day &amp; evening. 
                I was unspeakably shocked and repelled from you by that talk &amp; proposition of yours—you know what—there by the fountain. It seemed indeed to me, (for I will talk out 
                plain to you, dearest comrade,) that the one I loved, and who had always been so manly 
                &amp; sensible, was gone, &amp; a fool &amp; intentional murderer stood in his place. 
                I spoke so sternly &amp; cutting. (Though I see now that my words might have appeared 
                to have a certain other meaning, which I didn't dream of, insulting to you, never for 
                one moment in my thoughts.) But I will say no more of this—for I know such thoughts must 
                have come when you was not yourself, but in a moment of derangement—&amp; have passed away like a bad dream.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dearest boy, I have not a doubt but you will get well, and entirely well—&amp; we will one day look back on these drawbacks &amp; sufferings as things long past. 
                The extreme cases of that malady, (as I told you before) are persons that have very 
                deeply diseased blood, probably with syphilis in it, inherited from parentage, 
                &amp; confirmed by themselves—so they have no foundation to build on. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">You</span> are of healthy stock, 
                with a sound constitution, &amp; good blood—&amp; I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">know</span> it is impossible for it to continue long. 
                My darling, if you are not well when I come back I will get a good room or two in some quiet place, 
                (or out of Washington, perhaps in Baltimore,) and we will live together, &amp; devote ourselves 
                altogether to the job of curing you, &amp; rooting the cursed thing out entirely, 
                &amp; making you stronger &amp; healthier than ever. I have had this in my mind before, 
                but never broached it to you. I could go on with my work in the Attorney General's office 
                just the same—&amp; we would see that your mother should have a small sum every week to keep the pot a-boiling at home.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear comrade, I think of you very often. My love for you is indestructible, 
                &amp; since that night &amp; morning has returned more than before.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Pete, dear son, my darling boy, my young &amp; loving brother, don't let the devil 
                put such thoughts in your mind again—wickedness unspeakable—murder, death &amp; disgrace here, 
                &amp; hell's agonies hereafter—Then what would it be afterward to the mother? What to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">me</span>?—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Pete, I send you some money, by Adam's Express—you use it, dearest son, &amp; when it is gone, 
                you shall have some more, for I have plenty. I will write again before long—give my love to Johnny Lee, my dear darling boy, I love him truly—(let him read these three last lines)—Dear Pete, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">remember</span>—</p>
