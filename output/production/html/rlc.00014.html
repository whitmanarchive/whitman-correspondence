      <p class="tei_p">It is now some time since I have written to you, or heard any thing from you. I still remain here laid up unwell from my paralysis—but
        keep much the same—no worse. I enclose you some slips—those relating to myself,
        (which tell their own story) because I know you will be interested in any thing about me—and the humorous pieces because I remember you are curious
        about American dialect &amp; fun literature.
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">As I write, it is a dark, rainy, muddy day. I am to recite a piece tonight for the benefit
        of the poor fund—it will be printed in the paper, &amp; I
        will send it to you. I tell you this partly to show you I still take some part in affairs,
        though I am badly shattered &amp; old. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Remember your letters are always welcome to me. </p>
