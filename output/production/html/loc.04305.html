                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    be buried in Harleigh Cemetery, in Camden, New Jersey, in an elaborate granite
                    tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of Philadelphia built the tomb, at
                    a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs with money that
                    his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a summer cottage;
                    the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor, Thomas Harned.

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George

                    called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for significant physical and
                    mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his mother until her death
                    in 1873. During his mother's final illness, George Whitman and his wife Louisa
                    Orr Haslam Whitman took over Eddy's care, with financial support from Walt
                    Whitman. In 1888, Eddy was moved to an asylum at Blackwood, New Jersey. For more
