            <p class="tei_p">The news is pretty gloomy yet from O'C[onnor] as you see from
                the enclosed card—Ab't the same with me as hitherto
                of late. Cloudy &amp; dull weather. Horace has been in this
                    forenoon—Ed has just been making up the bed
                &amp;c—I am sitting here in the big chair back'd with the old
                wolf-skin—not cold to-day, (but half raw)—Six letters rec'd by mail,
                &amp; five of them autograph applications! (Did I acknowledge the Bury English paper
                July 13 1880 with y'r California &amp;c narrative wh' I peruse &amp; over again with
                the greatest interest?)</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evn'g</span>—All fair as usual—bowel action—the
                daylight grows apace—it is 7 &amp; I have just lighted the gas—very
                quiet—even dull as I write—this goes in the Phila: P O soon after 8 P
                M—when does it reach you?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see in this evng's news death of John Bright—a
                grand star quench'd—Herbert Gilchrist here this
                afternoon—he says there is late news of Tennyson's bad illness—I haven't
                seen it—</p>
