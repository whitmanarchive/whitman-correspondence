                a costly residence on Farragut Square and is a very pleasant, educated
                man—evidently of wealth. I saw there on the wall of his parlor a fine, large

                mentioned the proposed pension for you, and he said that if you were in need of
                assistance he thought there would be no trouble in raising a purse and that he would
                be glad to take hold of the matter if it was thought advisable. If the pension is
