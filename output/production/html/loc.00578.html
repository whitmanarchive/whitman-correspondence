            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps Mr. Clapp told you of our offer to take it September 1st. We rec'd a letter to day from him stating he intended to visit us Monday or Tuesday to make some arrangement with us—if possible.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The tone of his letter indicates a determination to make a trade with us of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">some</span> kind, and therefore we wish to have any statement of his affairs he may make corroborated by others.
