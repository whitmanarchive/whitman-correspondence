               <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>  
         <p class="tei_p">You will accept our
            <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hearty</span> thanks for your kindly advice about the S.P.—You can rely upon our keeping it secret—
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps Mr. Clapp told you of our offer to take it September 1st. We rec'd a letter to day from him stating he intended to visit us Monday or Tuesday to make some arrangement with us—if possible.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Now as you have been so kind as to give us a valuable hint, will you please write us per return mail stating what you know of the affairs of the S.P.—that is if it can be done without trenching upon your friendly relations with Mr. Clapp? Is the paper in debt; if so to whom; are there any liabilities incurred, which would make it subject to attachment if sold to and owned by parties not formerly connected with it;—what are Mr. Howland's claims, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00528.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00528.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00528.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>and of what nature.  Does he help edit the paper? These questions are asked with a view to our being the sole owners of the Press with Mr. Clapp for editor.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The tone of his letter indicates a determination to make a trade with us of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">some</span> kind, and therefore we wish to have any statement of his affairs he may make corroborated by others. If you have no objections to answering our queries we would esteem it a favor to hear from you by <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">return mail</span>.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Your suggestion as to our discerning the ownership and responsibilities of the paper we regard as the only practical thing that can be done, toward relieving Mr. C. from his difficulties. Of course we should not want it unless he was its <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Editor</span> and we could be its <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">business</span> managers.  <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">We</span> can make it <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">pay</span> (we think) in a very short time—Beside we are deeply interested in sustaining any journal that dares <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00529.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00529.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00529.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>in these days of literary flunkeyism to be independent, and make the literature of a country what it should be.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now if Mr. C. can obtain a business party to do the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">business</span> of the paper, (T &amp; E or some other), what a flourishing paper could be got up. But T &amp; E do not want to be subjected to any liabilities connected with the past of the S.P. and therefore proceed with caution before operating.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We wrote to Mr. C. some days ago making an offer, but now we shall act having in view your suggestion.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">About the L of G.—Our Mr. E. is in the country, to return tonight or tomorrow. He will write you at length about the Cheap Edition as he has it in charge—Will Mr. Clapp use <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00530.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.00530.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.00530.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>the notice of L of G in the Cincinnati Daily Press? If not please re-mail it to us when you have done with it. We have heard of the "Dial" notice, but could not get a copy here. We have written to the Editor for a copy.</p>

Yes, Walt Whitman: though men of the world and arch-critics do not <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">understand</span> thee, yet some there be among men and women who <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">love</span> thee and hold thy spirit close by their own.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt,  I wrote you in the name of T &amp; E a longer letter than I intended. Somehow I could not stop. I felt such a wondrous geniality, that I enjoyed looking at your handwriting and imagined you were before me instead of the letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My dear little wife wants to write you a letter, and will when the domestic gods are propitious, so that she can talk with the great Poet as she would like. She has had much ill health, but is now much better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you could visit our home. The country is delightful. You would laugh and grow fat to see our blessed Jamaica Plain, and enjoy its beauties.—Come and see us if you can.</p>
