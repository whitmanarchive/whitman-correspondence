            <p class="tei_p">George is all right, unhurt, up to Tuesday morning, 10th inst—the 51st was in a bad battle last Friday, lost 20 killed, between 40 &amp; 50 wounded—I have just seen some of the 51st wounded, just arrived, one of them Fred Saunders, Corp[oral], Co K, George's company—he said when he left the 51st was in rear on guard duty—he left Tuesday mn'g last—the papers have it that Burnside's Corps was in a fight Tuesday, but I think it most probable the 51st was not in it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Fred McReady is wounded, badly, but not seriously—Sims is safe—you see LeGendre is wounded—he was shot through the bridge of nose—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, you ought to get this Friday forenoon, 13th—I will write again soon—wrote once before to-day—</p>
