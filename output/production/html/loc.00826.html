                    (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Walt Whitman recorded substantially the same
                    information given here and in his letter from <a href="loc.00827">May 13,
                        1864</a>. Corporal Saunders (or Sanders) was confined in Finley Hospital.
                    Whitman methodically cited the names and locations of the wounded soldiers from
                    the Fifty-first Regiment who had been transferred to hospitals in or near
                    Washington. For McReady, see Whitman's letter from <a href="loc.00770">May
                        13, 1863</a>; for Sims, the letter from <a href="loc.00772">May 26,
                        1863</a>; and for LeGendre, the letter from <a href="loc.00766">April
