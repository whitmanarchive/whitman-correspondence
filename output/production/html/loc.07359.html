                me—No sight of Rhys yet—the artist Eakin of
                    Phila: comes off &amp; on painting my portrait—it is
                going to be realistic &amp; severe I think (ab't likeness, excellence &amp;c. we
                will see)—Did I tell you I rec'd a letter from O'C[onnor]
                ten days ago, rather cheery?</p>
