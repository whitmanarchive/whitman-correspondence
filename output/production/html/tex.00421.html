            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of May 14 rec'd, with the £3—Many
                thanks—I send the three L of G by same mail with this, same
                address—please notify me soon as they reach you safely—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am much as usual—Pretty well a good deal of the time—go down to the
                Staffords' farm often—was there two weeks of this month—they are
                well—have not forgotten you—Harry still works at telegraphing—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was on in Boston five weeks since—but I believe I sent you a little printed
                item of my jaunt—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I sympathize with you in the loss of the dear mother—I have drunk of that
                cup—Commend me faithfully in good wishes to my unmet friends you come
                across—to Robert Sharkland, whose name I have written as you desired, in the
                Volume—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Write to me as often as you can, my dear friend—&amp; I will try the same to
                you—</p>
