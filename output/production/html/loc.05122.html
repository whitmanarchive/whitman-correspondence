                question 'Has America produced any great poet?' But as yet I have had no success. I
                fancy the thing fell through. There are very few ideas in Germany about American
                literature, past, present, or future. I got a few days ago a book called 'Aus dem
                Amerikanischen Dichterwald', by D<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Rudolph Doehn. It has about 300 pages, &amp;
                professes, with justice, to be the first comprehensive properly historical and

                disappointed with it. There seemed to be a great lack of intelligence about
                it—no recognition at all that anything particularly American was to be
                expected of American literature; just the conventional praise and blame—plenty
                of the former, for such qualities as melody, elegance, fine sentiment, &amp;c. Doehn is
                rather celebrated in Germany &amp; has lived 12 years in America. He must be a rather
                wide-minded man, for he is not very greatly offended at you. But that's just
                it—he is so appreciative that a shock scarcely affects him and a vacuity
                affects him not at all.

            <span class="inline_quote"><p class="tei_p">"Not to be forgotten here is Walt Whitman, born on May 31st
                    1819 in a farm village on Long Island, N. York—of whom the saying holds
                    "He bears Eagles in his head, and buries his feet in the mire" (Er trägt
                    Adler im Haupte und steckt mit seinen Füssen tief im Kothe.) His father was
                    of English descent, his mother (Louisa van <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Belsor​ </span></span>, of Dutch origin.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> His brother, George M.
                    Whitman served during the Civil War as officer in a New York Regiment. Sprung
                    from a low social position (aus niedrigem Stande) W.W. was now farmer, now carpenter, now printer. Shortly before the outbreak of the civil war he
                    composed, and set up with his own hands, his Leaves of Grass, a set of
                    mystic-democratic poems which are rough and wholly without art, but not without
                        <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01014_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01014_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01014_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01014_large.jpg</span> strength
                    and content (Inhalt, substance). W.W. often pays no regard whatever to the
                    ordinary rules of morality and propriety (Anstand), but he does this, not from
                    attenuated deficient moral sense
                    (sittliche Verkommenheit), but because he regards the traditional observances of
                    morals and propriety as contemptible and hypocritical formalities. During the
                    civil war he was active for some time in the Sanitary Corps &amp; in the
                    hospitals; and also received a post in the Home Department;—but his
                    opponents, who saw in him a defender of "Free Love" were soon able to have him
                    removed therefrom. His "Drum Taps" appeared in 1865—are poetical
                    monologues on the war, suffer however, like almost all his compositions, from
                    over-monotony (übergroßer Monotonie). Of decided poetic worth is his monody
                    on Lincoln's death, beginning "When Lilacs" (&amp;c). The same may be said of the
                    poem "Come up from the Fields, father"—in which a deep <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01011_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01011_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01011_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01011_large.jpg</span>and warm
                    feeling expresses itself in a manner which lays hold of the reader (in
                    ergreifender Weise)."</p></span>

            <p class="tei_p">So Herr Doehn. You see he does not even mention that in your works, for the first
                time on a large scale, English poetry is written without rhyme &amp; metre—a
                notable fact surely. (I forgot your predecessor Blake). This gives one an idea of
                his want of critical intelligence—of a large view of linked facts &amp;
                tendencies.—He touches on all American authors in this way, taking them one by
                one, giving life, and some brief criticisms; Emerson &amp; Thoreau get little mention.
                But the last division of the book consists of longer &amp; more detailed accounts of 6
                authors, viz—R. H. Dana, Whittier, Miller (Joaquin), Bryant, Longfellow,
                Bayard Taylor. Many poems are quoted in the original, and translated—but none
                of yours. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf004r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01015_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.01015_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.01015_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.01015_large.jpg</span>This I

                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    (1810–1876) was an early German Whitman enthusiast. He read the Rossetti
                    edition of the poems while a political exile in Great Britain and published an
                    enthusiastic account of them in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Augsburger Allgemeine
                        Zeitung</span>, 24 April 1868. He followed this article with some
                    undistinguished and inaccurate translations from the Rossetti edition.
                    Freiligrath's importance in discovering Whitman for Germany is to be attributed
                    more to his critical appreciation of his work than to his translations. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.05122_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_frenz tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.05122_n6"><span><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Kottabos</span>, first issued in 1874, is a miscellany of verse and prose
