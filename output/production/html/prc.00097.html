            <span class="tei_salute tei_salute_rend_left">Dear Sir:</span>
         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Would like to have say a four or five column article for the paper embodying the poems,
            &amp;c. of my new book "Two Rivulets," to publish say eight or ten days before their
            issue by me?—making a resume of the book in advance giving the principal pieces,
            (hitherto unpublished—&amp; to be first printed in said article.) If so, I will
            make out such an article &amp; send you, for your determination. The price would be
            $200.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have thought that as you like to have things in advance—&amp; also to give
            variety to the paper—such a proposition might be acceptable. If not, no harm
            done.</p>
