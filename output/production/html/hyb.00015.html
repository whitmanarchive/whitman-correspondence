A small edition was printed and issued at the time, but in six months or thereabout Thayer &amp; Eldridge failed, and these plates were stored away and nothing further done;—till about a year ago (latter part of 1879) they were put up in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​  city by Leavitt, auctioneer, &amp; bought in by said Worthington.

                        his dealings with Richard Worthington ("Holy Dick" was the poet's epithet
                        later), a New York publisher, is somewhat garbled. (Whitman's version in
                        1888 was filled with inaccuracies; see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906],
                        1:195–196, 250–251). Worthington bought the plates of the 1860
                        edition after they had been sold at auction by George A. Leavitt &amp; Co.
                        for $200 "to a Mr Williams" (see the letter from Whitman to John
                        Burroughs of <a href="uva.00385">December 7, 1880</a>). After the
                        plates came into Worthington's hands, he wrote to the poet on <a href="yal.00312">September 29, 1879</a>: "As the edition is not
                        complete although subject as I understand to a copyright of ten per cent it
                        seems to me that it would be better for all parties to have it completed. If
                        this idea meets your views on the subject I would be willing to make you an
                        immediate payment of $250.00 on account and will do everything in my
                        power to make the book sell." Despite Whitman's rejection of Worthington's
                        offer, the publisher began to run off copies from the plates.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">On August 20, 1880, Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke informed Eldridge that he had
                        lately discovered many copies of the 1860 edition (Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</span> [Boston:
                        Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 197–198). Probably at Bucke's suggestion
                        Whitman wrote on the following day to inquire whether Worthington still
                        owned the plates (see the letter from Whitman to Worthington of <a href="wwb.00001">August 21, 1880</a>). He probably wrote to the same
                        effect on September 19 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
                        Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                        Congress, Washington, D.C.). After Whitman was offered a copy of the pirated
                        book in Philadelphia on November 20, 1880, he decided to take action against
                        Worthington.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Early in December Scovel went to New York and compelled Worthington to pay a
                        royalty of $50. On December 6 Whitman sent a receipt to the publisher:
                        "Rec'd from R Worthington (thro Jas M Scovel) Fifty-Dollars on account of
                        royalty in selling(?) my book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> W.
                        Whitman" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). It would appear, despite the poet's
                        later observations, that the settlement permitted Worthington to continue
                        his sales (perhaps only of bound copies) so long as he paid a royalty. On
                            <a href="loc.03720">December 6</a> Scovel asked to be reimbursed:
                        "I expended $9.50 in pursuit of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">recalcitrant,
                            pirate</span> Worthington, in New York City." Whitman paid Scovel $10
                        (Whitman's Commonplace Book).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">On <a href="tex.00423">May 20, 1881</a>, Whitman informed Osgood &amp;
                        Co. that Worthington had "sold languid surreptitious copies—can be
                        stopt instantly by me &amp; will be." On August 11, 1881, Whitman "call'd on
                        R Worthington . . . &amp; had an interview of over half an hour—I told
                        him emphatically he must not print and publish another copy of L. of G. from
                        the '60-'61 plates—if so it would be at his peril—he offered
                        $50 down if I would warrant his printing a new edition of 500 from said
                        plates, which I peremptorily declined—Mr Williams &amp; one or two
                        clerks in the store heard the conversation—R. W. paid me $25 due
                        me on back sales—I shall not trouble him for any thing past—but
                        shall hold him to strict account for what is done after this date"
                        (Whitman's Commonplace Book).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Apparently Whitman again must have consented to Worthington's selling bound
                        copies, for on <a href="yal.00313">July 25, 1882</a>, the publisher
                        wrote to the poet: "I Enclose you check for 44.50 being Copyright on Leaves
                        of Grass sold since you last received check." In 1888 Whitman recalled only
                        the first payment and "another twenty-five dollars paid at another
                        time—I don't know when. I acknowledged both, on account, as royalty"
                        (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, 1:250).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">During the 1880s Worthington ran off additional copies. In 1885 Whitman,
                        again disturbed about the publisher's activities, wrote about the piracy in
                        a lost letter to Eldridge, who advised him on August 17 to write to a firm
                        in New York which made "a specialty of copyright cases" (Charles E. Feinberg
                        Collection). Evidently Whitman did not write to the firm, but again availed
                        himself of the services of Scovel. About November 5 he noted "from R
                        Worthington $24: through J M S" (Whitman's Commonplace Book).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">David McKay, the Philadelphia publisher of Whitman's writings, became
                        concerned about the plates. On February 12, 1886, Whitman noted "a visit
                        from D McKay, ab't the Worthington plates—subscription to purchase"
                        (Whitman's Commonplace Book).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In a letter to the editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span> on June 2,
                        1888, William Sloane Kennedy, without mentioning Worthington's name,
                        asserted: "Mr. Whitman has not received a cent of copyright on them. . . . I
                        hope that this note may be the means of inducing some rich friend of
                        Whitman's to put a lawyer on the case, and bring the New Yorkers who are
                        issuing the spurious books to justice." Interestingly, Whitman neglected to
                        inform Kennedy of the royalties ($143.50) he had accepted (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, 1:250). It is also
                        noteworthy that, despite Kennedy's remarks, Whitman refused to stop the
                        publisher: "I am averse to going to law about it: going to law is like going
                        to hell: it's too much trouble even if we win" (Traubel, 1:195 and 251). But
                        he was willing to go to law at someone else's expense.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Worthington continued to use the plates until they were purchased by the
                        literary executors after Whitman's death (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete
