A small edition was printed and issued at the time, but in six months or thereabout Thayer &amp; Eldridge failed, and these plates were stored away and nothing further done;—till about a year ago (latter part of 1879) they were put up in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="New York​ ">N Y</span>​  city by Leavitt, auctioneer, &amp; bought in by said Worthington. (Leavitt, before putting them up, wrote to me offering the plates for sale. I wrote back that said plates were worthless, being superseded by a larger &amp; different edition—that I could not use them, the 1860 ones, myself, nor would I allow them to be used by any one else—I being the sole owner of the copyright.)</p>

On <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="November​ ">Nov.</span>​  22, 1880, I found the book, (printed from those plates,) at Porter &amp; Coates' store, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="corner​ ">cor:</span>​  9th &amp; Chestnut Sts.
