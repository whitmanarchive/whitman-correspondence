            <p class="tei_p">Much the same subject continued. I am still confined to the room &amp; chair—eat &amp; drink
                moderately—my meals mostly mutton-broth with bits of the well-stew'd meat &amp; Graham
                bread &amp; sometimes roasted apples or a cup custard—appetite fair—of course
                monotonous here (it is getting to be the ninth month)—but I am comparatively
                comfortable &amp; get along better than you w'd suppose—snowing to-day, half-melting
                when it falls—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">You got the printed slips of the Sarrazin tran[slation] I sent?—Dr B[ucke] has the
                magazine—he has been forced to delay his jaunt this way—&amp; now names the 18th inst.
                to start hither—he may go directly to Wash'n to see O'C[onnor]—with a possibility
                of it being further put off—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">O'Connor is badly off—worse—&amp; I am much worried ab't him—he is laid up, mainly bed
                fast, in his house—very bad, at my last acc'ts four days since, from Mrs O'C—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I hear that the German (partial) tran: is advertised in the German papers—so we will
                soon get the book here—&amp; I will send you one when I get some—Pray you don't mind
                any little proof lapses in the S. trans: (if any)—it is a wonderfully <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">consoling</span>
                piece to me—coming from so evidently a fully equipt, sharp-eyed, sharp-nosed,
                sharp-ear'd Parisian Frenchman—running the critical leads the very deepest—&amp; here
                what he reports—I have rec'd a good long warm flattering letter from Addington
                Symonds from Switzerland with a large photo head—the best photo I ever saw—</p>
