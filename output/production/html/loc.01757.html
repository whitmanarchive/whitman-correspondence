            <p class="tei_p">My condition remains about the same—I don't get ahead any to notice—but I hold my own, as favorable as I have stated in my late letters,
                &amp; am free yet from the very confused spells of the head &amp; spasms of three weeks ago. 
                Besides I think upon the whole, my general strength is the best it has been yet—for an interval every now &amp; then it certainly is. All very encouraging—(But my disease seems to have such ups &amp; downs I have learned to fear to make 
                calculations, almost.) The weather here is fine—cool mornings &amp; nights, 
                indeed quite cold at times—but the bulk of the day perfect—I think the cool weather season is beneficial to me. I am sitting here 
                writing this with one of the windows wide open, &amp; the afternoon sun streaming in. 
                I got a letter this morning from Mr. Eldridge that he <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01757.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01757.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01757.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01757.002.jpg</span>

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
