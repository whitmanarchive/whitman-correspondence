            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">My condition remains about the same—I don't get ahead any to notice—but I hold my own, as favorable as I have stated in my late letters,
                &amp; am free yet from the very confused spells of the head &amp; spasms of three weeks ago. 
                Besides I think upon the whole, my general strength is the best it has been yet—for an interval every now &amp; then it certainly is. All very encouraging—(But my disease seems to have such ups &amp; downs I have learned to fear to make 
                calculations, almost.) The weather here is fine—cool mornings &amp; nights, 
                indeed quite cold at times—but the bulk of the day perfect—I think the cool weather season is beneficial to me. I am sitting here 
                writing this with one of the windows wide open, &amp; the afternoon sun streaming in. 
                I got a letter this morning from Mr. Eldridge that he <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01757.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01757.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01757.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                
                
                
                had paid Godey, 
                my substitute, the money I sent on for his October pay.—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Washington must be looking pleasant this fall. Write me how you are fixed, 
                and I like to hear all the particulars about your work, on the RR.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">It is now a little after 2—I have had my dinner, beefsteak &amp; <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">potatos​ </span><span class="tei_corr">potatoes​
        
      </span></span>—pumpkin pie &amp; a cup of tea—Don't you think that is doing very well?—It is a glorious afternoon &amp; I am going down to take a trip once or twice 
                    across the Delaware in the ferry boat. It makes a pleasant little trip as 
                    the river here is most as wide as the Potomac from 7<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">th</span> st. wharf—has two little islands in the middle, which sometimes we steer between, 
                    &amp; sometimes go round—Then <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">these nights</span> 
                    Pete—last night I was out, came home about 8—the moon shining 
                    bright as silver—I thought of our old walks, dear son.
