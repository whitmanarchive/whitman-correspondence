                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    article was published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</span> in
                    August 1891. It was a detailed account of Whitman's seventy-second (and last)
                    birthday, which was celebrated with friends at the poet's home on Mickle
                    street. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08072_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08072_n2"><span>As Bucke's letters in May
                    and June 1891 both to Whitman and Horace Traubel make clear, he was going abroad
                    to establish a foreign market for his gas and fluid meter, a subject to which he
                    referred constantly in his communications but which the poet studiously

                    an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was characterized by deep
                    mutual respect, and he soon became a close friend of the poet. For more on
