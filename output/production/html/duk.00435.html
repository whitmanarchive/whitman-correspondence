                    dated this letter February 26 or March 2, 1863. Bucke's date is incorrect, and
                    he probably erred because he associated George Washington Whitman's release from
                    imprisonment with his imminent arrival to Brooklyn. After his release from the
                    Confederate Military Prison at Danville, George arrived at Annapolis, Maryland,
                    on February 24, and he continued to Brooklyn several days later. See Jerome M.

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
