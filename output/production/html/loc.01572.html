            <p class="tei_p">Your kind &amp; welcome letter come to hand. Pardon me
                for not responding sooner. I esteem your friendly appreciation of "Democracy." I
                have just sent you "Personalism"—which is to be followed,
                in perhaps a couple of months or so, by another article, addressing itself
                mainly to the question of what kind of Literature we must seek, for our coming
                America. &amp;c. In the three articles (to be gathered probably in book) I put
                forth, to germinate if they may, what I would fain hope might prove little seeds
                &amp; roots.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am still living here in Washington.—employed in a post in the Attorney General's
                office, very pleasantly, with sufficient leisure, &amp; almost entirely without
                those peculiar belongings, that make the Treasury &amp; Interior 
                <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Department​ ">Dep't</span>​  &amp;c.
                clerkships disagreeable. I am, as ever, working on Leaves of Grass—hoping to bring
                it yet into fitter &amp; fuller proportions. I am well as usual. My dear mother is
                living &amp; well; we speak of you. I wish you to give my best respects &amp; love
                to Mr. Emerson</p>
