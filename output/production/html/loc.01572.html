                    Alcott noted receipt of Whitman's letter on April 28, 1868: "Say what men may,

                in late December 1862 after searching for his brother, George W. Whitman (1829–1901), a Union soldier in
                the American Civil War, who had been wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg.
                Walt Whitman would remain in Washington, D.C. for a decade, volunteering in the Civil
                War Hospitals and, later, performing clerical tasks for several government
