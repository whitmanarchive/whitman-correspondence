            <p class="tei_p">I arrived here and joined the Regiment about ten days ago and was placed in command of this Prison.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very well, indeed but have plenty to do as I have about 300 Prisoners (mostly thieves, Bounty jumpers and Deserters) to look after. I have 100 of the men of our Regt. and 5 Officers here with me guarding the Prisoners.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is about 20 Rebel officers here (Paroled Prisoners) but they are used very different from what we were, when we were in Rebeldom.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I saw Walt when I came through Washington, and I hear he was over to see me yesterday but did not find me. Well Mammy the war seems to be over, and I think the most of us will soon be sent home. It is now getting late (after Eleven O clock at night) and as I feel rather tired I will go through the Prison and see that all is right and then turn in. I sleep here in the building (I have a very good room) and take my meals at a Boarding house  I pay 6 dollars per week for grub but dont live any of the best.</p>
