                    (1837–1920) was an American realist novelist and literary critic, serving
                    the staff of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Nation</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harper's Magazine</span> during the mid 1860s. During his tenure as
                    editor-in-chief of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Atlantic Monthly</span> from 1871 to
                    1880, he was one of the foremost critics in New York, and used his influence to
                    support American authors like Hamlin Garland, Stephen Crane, and Emily
                    Dickinson. He also brought attention to European authors like Henrik Ibsen,
                    Giovanni Verga, and Leo Tolstoy in particular. Howells was highly skeptical of
                    Whitman's poetry, however, and frequently questioned his literary merit. In an
                    Ashtabula <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sentinel </span>review of the 1860 edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, Howells wrote, "If he is indeed 'the
                    distinctive poet of America,' then the office of poet is one which must be left
                    hereafter to the shameless and the friendless. for WALT WHITMAN is not a man
                    whom you would like to know." In 1865, Howells would write the first important
                    review of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Round
                        Table</span>, demonstrating early signs of his conflicted opinion about
                    Whitman. For more information on Howells, see Susan Goodman and Carl Dawson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Dean Howells: A Writer's Life</span> (Berkeley:

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
