            <span class="tei_salute">Dear brother Walt</span>
            <p class="tei_p">I append slip from the Evening paper of last Thursday that frightened us all so.
                I telegraphed Thursday evening and again Friday—and was on my way to the
                telegraph office yesterday afternoon when I was handed your dispatch. We were all glad
                to know that the statement was wrong although as the time passed and I had an
                opportunity to reason it over I felt pretty well assured that there was a mistake in
                the statement—The morning papers of Friday, however, all repeated the
                statement and gave as authority the press reports</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are all o.k. again and able to get around as usual. If you are tied down
                to the house I imagine you feel pretty sick. In my own case when sick I find that
                the fact that I cannot get out makes me feel as badly as anything else</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are all well and getting on quite

                nicely. The girls have been busy "putting up"
                large quantities of all sorts of stuff in the pickle &amp;c line—as much to
                practice I presume as with any idea that it would be needed</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had considerable to do this summer—have only been away once (to St
                Joseph) since I was East—I expect to go to St Jo
                the last of this week—and toward the middle or last of Nov hope to come
                East—at least as far as Camden—so dont be surprised to see me pop in at any time</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All send love to George and Lou and to yourself—by-the-way I must be
                considerable behind in regard to Ed's board—when George or Lou write ask them
                to please state how far and I will square up—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We are having splendid fall weather—never so delightful—I have just
                finished a seven days out door survey—putting up at the nearest place where
                night found us—the country was new to me and very beautiful—the weather
                perfect—it was like going back 25 years. Let me
                hear from you soon—again love to all</p>
