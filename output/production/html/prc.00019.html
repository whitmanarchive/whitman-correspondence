            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent you "Personalism"<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—which I suppose you received Monday last. I
                should consider it a favor from you to have the piece set up as soon as convenient,
                first proof carefully read &amp; corrected, &amp; then three sets of proofs
                taken &amp; mailed me here—One set I will read, and return
                immediately.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think of offering the article in England,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> probably to
                the Fortnightly Review—but of course any thing over there must be
                strictly subordinated to the appearance of the article here first—that is
                positive.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Can you let me have the proofs within a week or so?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think of asking you $100 for "Personalism." I reserve the right of printing
                it in future book.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">How about the little piece "Ethiopia Commenting"?<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> Will it not be practicable for
                you to print it in the April number? Certain poetical pieces of mine were arranged
                to appear soon in English magazine<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> &amp; I should like the "Ethiopia" to
                precede them.</p>

                    (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
                    York newspapers until he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Army and Navy
                        Journal</span> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
                    he established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866. Financial control of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. William
                    published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
                    Francis wrote for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> the unsigned piece
