            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I sent you "Personalism"—which I suppose you received Monday last. I
                should consider it a favor from you to have the piece set up as soon as convenient,
                first proof carefully read &amp; corrected, &amp; then three sets of proofs
                taken &amp; mailed me here—One set I will read, and return
                immediately.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think of offering the article in England, probably to
                the Fortnightly Review—but of course any thing over there must be
                strictly subordinated to the appearance of the article here first—that is
                positive.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Can you let me have the proofs within a week or so?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I think of asking you $100 for "Personalism." I reserve the right of printing
                it in future book.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">How about the little piece "Ethiopia Commenting"? Will it not be practicable for
                you to print it in the April number? Certain poetical pieces of mine were arranged
                to appear soon in English magazine &amp; I should like the "Ethiopia" to
                precede them.</p>
