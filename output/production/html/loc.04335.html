                    (1849–1912) was a well-known English journalist and editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Pall Mall Gazette</span> in the 1880s. He was a proponent of
                    what he called "government by journalism" and advocated for a strong press that
                    would influence public opinion and affect government decision-making. His
                    investigative reports were much discussed and often had significant social
                    impact. He has sometimes been credited with inventing what came to be called
                    "tabloid journalism," since he worked to make newspapers more attractive to
                    readers, incorporating maps, illustrations, interviews, and eye-catching
                    headlines. He died on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Titanic</span> when it sank in
                    1912. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n5">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02454_n5 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.02454_n5"><span>Whitman's essay "Old Poets"
