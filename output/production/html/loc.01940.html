                    Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875, Somerby assumed the liabilities of
                    Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's <a href="loc.01718">February 4, 1874</a>,
                    letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
                    embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
                    unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On <a href="loc.01934">May
                        5, 1875</a>, he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
                    position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On <a href="loc.01936">October 4, 1875</a>, Somerby sent $10—his
                    only cash payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require,
                    and find it utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would
                    accept our offer to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our
                    indebtedness to you." On <a href="loc.01937">April 19, 1876</a>, Somerby
                    reported that "I have been losing, instead of gaining." On <a href="loc.01939">May 6, 1876</a>, he sent Whitman a statement
                    pertaining to some volumes; on <a href="loc.01938">May 12, 1876</a>, he
                    included a complete financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one
                    cash payment, and owed Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to
                    make a payment as of the date of this letter. In August
                    1877, Whitman received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
                     from, in his
                    own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
                    Somerby." These manuscripts are in The Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, 
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n5001">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_note_xml:id_n5001 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="n5001"><span>As yet we have no information about
