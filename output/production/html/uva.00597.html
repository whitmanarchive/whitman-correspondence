            <p class="tei_p">Your card rec'd to day—Nothing particular or very new with me—Hot and
                oppressive here eight or nine days &amp; I have been under the weather probably from
                it as much as anything—Keep up ab't the same tho'—am taking a tonic dose
                (iron &amp; strychnia I fancy) prescribed by Dr Bucke to stave
                off the terrible weakness &amp; faintness—&amp; it does so—but it costs
                as much as it comes too—So far I eat &amp; sleep pretty well, wh' of course is
                the greatest help—Got a card f'm Hannah, &amp; have
                written to her this evn'g—I send my best love to Amy and Warren—I wish I had something to send them—They are
                getting printed in a little book the speeches &amp;c at my birth-day dinner &amp; I
                will send you one when out—&amp; one to Emma
                too—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I havn't been out this is the fourth day in the wheel chair but shall resume in a day
                or two—I am sitting here in the old den in Mickle st second story near sunset
                quite comfortable—</p>
