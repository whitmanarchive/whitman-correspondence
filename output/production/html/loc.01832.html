    <div class="editorial_notes"><hr/><p><em>Correspondent:</em><br/><span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_xml:id_n0494 tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n0494"><span>Hiram J. Ramsdell
                    (1839–1887) was a clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E.
                    Huntington Library, San Marino, California), Whitman called him "chief clerk." Ramsdell was the
                    Washington correspondent for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> and the
                    Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span>. On <a href="loc.01829">May 8,
                        1867</a>, Ramsdell reported the high praise that George Townsend, the
                    journalist (1841–1914), accorded to Whitman—"a stupendous
                    genius," "the song of a God." On <a href="loc.01830">July 17, 1867</a>, he
                    asked Whitman to do whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho,
                    against whom charges had been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward
                    Dexter Holbrook (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory.
                    Actually, on July 12, 1867, Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a
                    "Report on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Charges</span> submitted by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. E. D. Holbrook</span>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">against</span>
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. Milton Kelly</span>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
                    Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
                    in Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
                    Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but inscribed by Whitman, dated July 20,
                    1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
                    ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
                    presented." On <a href="loc.01832">July 22, 1867</a>, Ramsdell apologized
                    for his "aggressiveness." Judge Kelly wrote to Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867
                    (National Archives), and again on <a href="yal.00125">August 9, 1867</a>.
                    On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow
                    (1832–1896), Secretary of the Treasury, that Whitman "be appointed to a
                    position in the Treasury Department" (National Archives &amp; Records Administration, Washington, D.C.). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01832_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01832_n1"><span> This letter is postmarked:

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
