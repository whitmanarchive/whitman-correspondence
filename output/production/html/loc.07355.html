            <p class="tei_p">A beautiful July day. Warm enough but not hot. All here peaceful and quiet. Am in my
                office, it is now noon. I have attended chapel, written a few letters (to
                    Kennedy and others) &amp; pause to think, to take stock of
                my surroundings and what is next to do. I had a long good letter from Horace two days ago. He is a good fellow—you have no better
                friend I like him well for your sake and for his own.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">No word from Willy Gurd for about a week I expect him home
                almost daily—he has had some delay—some work he could not

            get done as expected—guess he must be about over the hitch by this time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I say, Walt, what became of that letter of Symonds' to you which
                you were going to send me some months ago? You were
                going to have it set up but I guess did not—Has Horace got it or where is it?
                I should like much to see it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I had a card a few days ago from Mrs O'C. It seems to be hot
                down there in Washington—there is no place can beat <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">right
