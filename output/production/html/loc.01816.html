         <p class="tei_p">I am enraged and ashamed with myself to have never sent you a word responsive to your
            letters of July 5th &amp; 24th. Believe that I have thought of you much, however, and
            for the last fortnight I have talked of you incredibly, saying superb things all the
            time, to Mr. Channing<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> whom you know, and to Miss Griffith
            whom perhaps you have not heard of. She is a handsome and heroic Kentucky girl, who
            several years ago impoverished herself by liberating her slaves, (seven of them, I
            think,) and then came North to live, the South being hateful to her on account of
            slavery. She lives in New York, but has come on here for a time and <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03022.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03022.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03022.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03022.004.jpg</span>is staying with her sister

            she likes (of course!!!). So I told her much, painting you as the gigantesque angel of
            valor, compassion, and poetry that you are, and reciting moreover all the splendid
            passages from your book that I could remember, besides numerous excerpts from your
            forthcoming volume! This, you see, involved considerable conversation about you and you
            must admit that I have kept you well in mind.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I am indeed glad to know from your letter and from a recent report from Howells that you
            are getting better. I have felt very anxious about you.

         <p class="tei_p">The heat of the last fortnight has been fearful, but tonight, thank goodness, there has
            been a rattling thunder storm, flash and crash, with a deluge of rain and the moon now
            shines through broken clouds on an earth drenched and cool. It was such rain as we have
            often seen here from my windows, only this time I saw it all alone.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I drill every day between three and four in the afternoon. It is fine exercise and good
            for me, though what with the torrid sun (for we drill <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03022.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03022.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03022.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03022.006.jpg</span> out of doors) and the weight of a sixteen
            pound rifle with accoutrements, it is pretty severe.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Glad you got the Report on Armored Vessels. I thought it might yield hints for poems. At
            all events, it gives one a good idea of what the Monitors are and can do. They are, as I
            once said to you, an upheld finger of warning to all despotocracy. The Dictators will
            prove a clenched hand of menace to the same. Soon America can defy all outward foes.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I want very much to hear that "Drum Taps" are printing. I have many misgivings about
            your plan of getting out the book yourself. I want it to have a large sale, as I think

            afraid that this sort of private publication will keep it from being known or accessible
            to any considerable number of people. Such a volume ought to make your fame secure and
            with a good publisher I think it would. How I wish Eldridge was in the field!</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Are you going to get it done by subscription? I want to know because I want to help as
            much as I can. The rascally Congress taxes me in September fifty dollars in a lump,
            besides my usual income tax, so that I shall not be able to do as well as I intended,
            but if subscription is the order of the day, I mean to give as much as I can. So let me

         <p class="tei_p">Eldridge<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> is down at Petersburgh paying troops. Alas, Walt!
            There is no hope of Richmond. The campaign has proved a failure. Every thing shows that
            Grant is coming back and the next fighting will probably be in the Shenandoah Valley if
            not in Ohio or Pennsylvania. It is sad to think of the eighty thousand men, veterans,
            lost so fruitlessly.—I think Mr Lincoln's chances for the next presidency are very
            small. Victory at Atlanta is possible, and may save him, but the signs are that the
            party will withdraw him and run some other man.—I see New York had one of her
            oceanic meetings for McClellan lately. I fear he will be our next President.</p>

         <p class="tei_p">The Count<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">7</a> I have not seen for several weeks. The last time I
            saw him, he abused me frightfully—for the first time! I happened to say, very
            quietly, that the Rebels would probably repeat their raid into Maryland very soon. (A
            week afterward they did so and burned Chambersburgh). <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf004v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03022.010.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03022.010.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03022.010.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03022.010.jpg</span>Whereupon the Count clutched his straw hat

            are an <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">ass</span>!" and, in a word, behaved like a maniac. Indeed his
            conduct convinced me that he is a madman with lucid intervals. I seriously mean it. No
            one could burst into such tempests of rage and abuse on so slight an occasion and be
            sane. A few nights afterward, he undertook to discipline the firemen with a pistol,
            during a conflagration, because they did not move quickly enough, for which freak he
            suffered fine and imprisonment.</p>

                    William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
                    Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
                    William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
                    various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
                    government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on

                    (1830–1910) was the wife of William D. O'Connor. Nelly O'Connor, whose
                    marital strife with William had led to a separation in 1870 and resulted in
                    divorce, wrote an admiring letter to Walt Whitman from Providence, Rhode Island,
                    shortly before this visit to Brooklyn (see Nelly's <a href="loc.01815">November 20, 1870</a> letter to Walt; and see Florence B. Freedman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">William Douglas O'Connor: Walt Whitman's Chosen Knight</span>
                    [Athens: Ohio University Press, 1985], 246). For a time Walt Whitman lived with
                    the O'Connors, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be
                    his close associates during the early Washington years. The correspondence
                    between Walt Whitman and Nelly is almost as voluminous as the poet's
                    correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors, see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00324_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_revised tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00324_n2"><span>Count Adam Gurowski
                    (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Diary</span> (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war
                    written with a marked partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a
                    colorful figure: he covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a
                    Roman head...a powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at
                    him" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> [New
                    York, Rowman and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). In this letter, O'Connor, who
                    apparently translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from
                    Gurowski to O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman that Gurowski "is a
                    madman with lucid intervals"—he had attempted "to discipline the firemen
                    with a
                    pistol."
                    Whitman told Traubel, in 1888, that Gurowski was "truly a remarkable, almost
                    phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
                    (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on <a href="loc.00942">November 24, 1863</a>, that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
                    I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
                    trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Diary</span>, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first
                    category of his threefold evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume":
                    "Praise," "Half and Half," and "Blame." The Count referred to Whitman in his
                    entry for April 18, 1864, as among "the most original and genuine American
                    hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote (372–373), appended September 12,
                    1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had "shown himself to be animated by a spirit
                    of narrow-minded persecution that would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman
                    inquisitor." Gurowski was praised by Robert Penn Warren in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Writers at Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews</span>, ed. Malcolm Cowley
                    (New York: Viking, 1958), 189. See also LeRoy Fischer, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Mississippi Valley Historical Review</span>, 36 (1949–1950):
