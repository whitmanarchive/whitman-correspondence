                <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter of Sunday week, Jan. 26—Mother, I hope that lameness in
                the wrist is better by this time.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> There is no news to write you this
                time—I have heard that old Mrs. Mix got through safe to Brooklyn the next
                    day—<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I
                looked for Jeff, but he didn't come—<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> When you write, tell
                me how Jeff is—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you have had a great change in the weather in Brooklyn—we have
                here—for several days past, it has been thawing &amp; melting—Here in
                the office, it is the same old story—it is now about 12 o'clock—the
                Attorney Gen'l. &amp; Ashton<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> have gone to the Supreme Court—they go most
                every day now from 11 till 2—&amp; I have little or nothing to do a good deal
                of the time when they are away—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, write whether Jeff got the books, for himself &amp; Dr. Ruggles—<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>write how Hattie is—Well, the
                sun is shining, &amp; as I look out this morning on the Potomac, I see the ice is
                broke up, &amp; the river is all open—I hope we shall have but little more
                cold weather—I have not had a very agreeable winter—I have not had a
                satisfactory room &amp; arrangements—I think I shall look around &amp; get
                one more suitable—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother, do you still have the office partly in your house—there in the long
                room?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Sometimes I feel as though I want to come home for about a week—I think it
                quite likely I shall come before long—I should not be able to stay longer than
                a week—I will tell you though, in time—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I believe that is all this time. Give my love to George, &amp;
                Jeff &amp; Mat.</p>

                    daughter's death on January 7, 1867 (which Walt Whitman reported to his mother
                    on <a href="tex.00184">January 15, 1867</a>), Mix left Washington to live

                    practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems."
                    Walt Whitman enclosed a copy of Ruggles' obituary with his <a href="duk.00644">March 19, 1867</a> letter to his mother. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li></ul>
