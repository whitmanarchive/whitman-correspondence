            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got the copy I mail'd you some three or four days ago—the
                additional matter (27 printed pages) for "Democratic Vistas"—I enclose
                herewith the MS of a little Preface. The title page ought to be </p>
            <span class="tei_ab"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democratic Vistas</span></span> <span class="tei_ab">and other Pieces</span> <span class="tei_ab">By Walt Whitman</span>
                <p class="tei_p">Leave out "Two Letters"
                (p 315 and partly on p 316)—Leave out altogether the Appendix pieces (pp 339
                to 374 inclusive)—And I should suggest to have "Notes left over" (pp 317 to
                338) come last in the volume, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">finishing it.</span> Finally I
                give you the same privilege over the putting together of this, as my other volumes.
                (Is there any probability of a second edition of "Spec: Days"? Is it
                stereotyped?)</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">To the Publisher</span>—For this Volume, the Preface, &amp;c. I
                shall expect £10:10s (same as my other vols) and also 10 copies of the "Vistas"
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bound in roan</span>. I wish the am't of the bill for the 50
                copies "Spec:Days" (sent me three months ago,) deducted from the £10:10s and
                when you send the balance, send in P.O. order.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Respects &amp; good will to all</p>
