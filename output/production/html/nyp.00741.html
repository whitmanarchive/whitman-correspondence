                    (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
                    with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
                    often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
                    Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    were printed slips of Whitman's poems "A Twilight Song" and "For Queen Victoria's Birthday." The

                    Home News</span> on May 30. On May 25, 1890, Rhys wrote to Harry Buxton Forman about the slips: "Not being a Royalist,
                    I did not much relish having to make a midnight pilgrimage from here to Fleet St. on Friday night with the slips
                    in question (for they only reached me that evening); but I felt compelled to honour the old fellow's wish.
                    I enclose one of the slips, as it has its own autograph, &amp; may fit in to your collection of odds &amp; 
                    ends" (The Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, New York Public Library).

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
