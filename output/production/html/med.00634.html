                    uneducated corkcutter of Sunderland, England, was one of Whitman's early English
                    admirers. In 1856 he had bought copies of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    from a book peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to
                    William Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and was
                    in effect the ideal laborer of Ruskin, who printed many of his letters to the
                    corkcutter in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Time and Tide</span> (1867). See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</span>, ed. W. Minto
