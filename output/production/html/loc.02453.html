            </span>  
            <p class="tei_p">Thanks to you for your kind p.c &amp; for your long &amp; interesting letter both of
                which I received yesterday—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am much grieved to hear of the death of your brother Jefferson
                which must have been a heavy blow to you &amp; one which I am sure you would feel
                most acutely. On behalf of the friends here &amp; myself I desire to tender you our
                sincere &amp; heartfelt sympathy in your sore bereavement. May the Great Healer
                &amp; Consoler pour His balm into your wounded heart &amp; give you of his sweet
                Peace &amp; Comfort!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am also extremely sorry to hear of your continued indisposition &amp; I hope that
                by this time things have taken a more favourable turn with you &amp; that<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02453.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02453.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02453.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> your strong faith
                &amp; your vast store of long suffering patience, indomitable pluck and hopeful
                joyousness may bear you through these "gloomy blue days" as they have done so often
                before.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I received a good letter from Dr Bucke yesterday in which he
                gives me some professional details of your illness which were very welcome from a
                brother medico.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad that you like &amp; endorse my Notes &amp; I thank you cordially for your
                kindly remarks concerning them—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It may interest you to know that "the boys" gave me a
                "surprise party" on the evening of Dec. 8<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>—my
                birthday—&amp; presented me with a handsome "Literary machine"—a reading
                &amp; writing stand—bearing a brass plate engraved "To John Johnston, Esq.
                M.D., 'Something for a token' From the Boys of the College. Bolton, Dec. 8<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> 1890."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">After the presentation &amp; speeches R K Greenhalgh
                consecrated the stand by reading aloud from it a Manifesto written by J. W.
                    Wallace—characterised as a Chieftan's call to
                arms—rousing us to a sense of the value &amp; importance of our little Society
                of Friends &amp; urging upon us the necessity for strengthening the bonds of mutual
                manly love &amp; true Comradeship &amp; the cultivation of the Higher Self. The rest
                of the evening was spent in merriment—songs recitations &amp; social
                converse—two original humourous songs about "the Doctor" being contributed by
                W. Dixon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">By this mail I am sending a parcel of Christmas literature for you &amp; some of the

            <p class="tei_p">I saw Fred. Wild last night. He sends his love &amp; his

                should be obliged if you would kindly send the book to him direct.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Many thanks to you for kindly sending Mr Johnstone's copy.</p>
