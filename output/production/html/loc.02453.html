                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    (1855–1928) was a lawyer's clerk and a member of the "Bolton College" of
                    Whitman admirers. He was also affiliated with the Labour Church, an organization
                    whose socialist politics and working-class ideals were often informed by
                    Whitman's work. Dixon communicated directly with Whitman only a few times, but
                    we can see in his letters a profound sense of care for the poet's failing
                    health, as well as genuine gratitude for Whitman's continued correspondence with
                    the "Eagle Street College." See Dixon's letters to Whitman of <a href="loc.01474">June 13, 1891</a> and <a href="loc.01476">February
