                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
                    Miller (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.31.html"> Tuesday, August 14, 1888</a>). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    Whitman shortly before the poet moved to Mickle Street and at that time arranged
                    to purchase Charles Hine's portrait of Whitman for $200. The
                    portrait—an oil painting of Whitman—had served as the basis for
                    Stephen Alonzo Schoff's engraving of the poet for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> (1860). On <a href="loc.05766">March 25</a>, Johnston sent
                    $100. On August 10, Whitman noted receipt of an additional $25
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), and
                    Johnston sent additional partial payments for the portrait. In an undated entry
                    that was likely written about December 28, Whitman recorded the receipt of
                    $50 from Johnston "for portrait—now paid in full, $200" (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
