                    (1858–1918) was an American journalist and reform writer. Born in Illinois
                    to Rev. Alfred Flower (1822–1907) and Elizabeth Orange (1821–1896),
                    Flower studied for a few years at Transylvania University in Lexington,
                    Kentucky, in hopes of pursuing a religious vocation like his father. Flower left
                    university after a change of religion and took up journalism, founding <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The American Spectator</span> in 1886, a magazine succeeded by
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Arena</span> three years later. The magazine advocated
                    social reform movements including socialism, prohibition, and trade unionism,
                    and published work from authors Stephen Crane, Hamiln Garland, and Upton
                    Sinclair. After <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Arena</span> ceased publication in 1909,
                    Flower began the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Twentieth-Century Magazine</span> that ran
                    until 1911. His essays from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Arena</span> were gathered in
                    several volumes, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilization's Inferno; or, Studies
                        in the Social Cellar</span> (Boston: Arena Publishing Co., 1893) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Persons, Places and Ideas: Miscellaneous Essays</span> (Boston:
                    Arena Publishing Co., 1896). He is also author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Christian
                        Science as a Religious Belief and a Therapeutic Agent</span> (Boston:
                    Twentieth Century Co., 1910) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Progressive Men, Women, and
                        Movements of the Past Twenty-Five Years</span> (Boston: The Arena, 1914). For
                    more information, see Allen J. Matusow, "The Mind of B. O. Flower," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New England Quarterly</span> 34.4 (December 1961),
