                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    an American anatomist from New York. Before his illustrious medical career, he
                    served in the 37th New York Volunteers (1861–1863) and then transferred to
                    Washington, D.C., for government service, where he became intimately familiar
                    with Walt Whitman and John Burroughs. After receiving a medical degree from
                    Columbia University, he served as professor of anatomy at Georgetown University,
                    assistant superintendent of the United States Life Saving Service, and president
                    of numerous biological and medical societies, among them the Anthropological
