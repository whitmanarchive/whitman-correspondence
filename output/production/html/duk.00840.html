            <p class="tei_p">Have come over here on a few days' visit to R P Smith on Arch street—Enjoy
                all—Have just had my dinner—Mr S is one of my kindest friends. Y'r
                letters rec'd—always welcomed. The Gilchrist book seems to be making quite a
                ripple—Y'r comments on it I tho't tip top—</p>
