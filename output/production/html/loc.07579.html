            <p class="tei_p">All goes well &amp; as usual—A sunny day, pleasant, fairly cool—bowel
                dejection—have been thinking a good deal of O'Connor—sent to him a letter &amp; papers last night—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs of 7th has come by the 2 p m mail—you have of
                course by this time the printed slip-sheet of the Sarrazin
                trans: by K[ennedy] &amp; it is good—but I suspect there
                is plenty left of the S review, more that I sh'd like well to have—if (quite
                when opportune) you feel to make such additional trans: do so—but do not
                bother or hurry ab't it—but you probably have trans: &amp; I shall get it
                to-morrow—Upon the whole I opine S's piece is the best we have rec'd in
                Europe—&amp; that's saying a good deal. I have sent you six copies the S
                piece—Would it facilitate any when you come, (&amp; supposing the leave
                obtained)—if you went directly from London to Washington, to see &amp; be a
                few hours with O'C?—or is it best to come to Phila: &amp; go hence to W?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Still all well, I believe—Horace last evn'g bro't over
                four copies of the "Complete" in their good half-calf binding—they are superb,
                the best part being the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">substantiality</span>, with the rich
                plainness of the look of them, one is for H himself with a dedication (wh' I have
                written in just now) &amp; one I keep for you—Look for word f'm Mrs: O'C to morrow.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I enc: Mary Costelloe's letter, tho'
                I dare say you have every minute occupied—</p>
