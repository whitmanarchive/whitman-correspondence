                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
                    Miller (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.31.html"> Tuesday, August 14, 1888</a>). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).

                    problems in dating: there is an ink smudge where Whitman apparently changed 12
                    to 14; one legible postmark is clearly "2-14-87." In 1887, however, February 14
                    fell on Monday, not on Sunday. The Johnstons had visited Whitman on February 6
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), a fact
                    (if correct) which makes some of the comments in the note superfluous. Since the
                    poet was "half sick (or more than half) most of the month," he could have erred
                    in dating the card either as to the day of the week or the date, or have
                    forgotten the recent visit (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3029">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3029 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3029"><span>Alma Calder Johnston was an author
