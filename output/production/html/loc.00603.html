                    Smith were the parents of Bethuel Smith, Company F, Second U.S. Cavalry, who was
                    wounded in 1863 and met Whitman shortly after. He wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.00596">September 17, 1863</a>, from the U.S. General Hospital
                    at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
                    He expected, he explained on <a href="loc.00598">September 28, 1863</a>,
                    to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
                    on <a href="loc.00889">October 13, 1863</a>. He wrote on <a href="loc.00601">December 16, 1863</a>, from Culpeper, Virginia, that he
                    was doing provost duty, and on <a href="loc.00602">February 28, 1864</a>,
                    he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry
                    hard." He was wounded again on June 11, 1864, as this letter states. He was
                    transported to Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on
                    August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30,
                        1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have
                    drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave
                    the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on <a href="loc.00882">October 22, 1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman from
                    Queensbury, N.Y. When his parents communicated with Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.00605">January 26, 1865</a>, Bethuel was well enough to
                    perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote
                    ten years later; see Walt Whitman to Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (Edwin
