                    oak-fire—Ed has gone over to Donaldson's with a copy of the big book I have sent him—quite
                alone—no visitors to-day—no doctors—Send you enclosed
                letters—(may be uninteresting—if so throw 'em in the fire)—I am
                waiting to hear from the German translation (I fancy now out)—shall tell you
                soon as I hear—O that I could get out &amp; bask in this copious sunshine of
                to-day—</p>
