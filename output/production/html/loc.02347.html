                    (1837–1912) was the editor of the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>
                    from 1872 to 1905. He met Whitman in the hospitals during the Civil War. Of his
                    relations with the poet Reid later observed: "No one could fail then [during the
                    War] to admire his zeal and devotion, and I am afraid that at first my regard
                    was for his character rather than his poetry. It was not till long after 'The
                    Leaves of Grass' period that his great verses on the death of Lincoln conquered
                    me completely"; see Charles N. Elliot, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman as Man,

                    letter to Reid, Whitman had protested what he considered a slurring reference to
                    his health in a news item in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span>. In apologizing
                    on <a href="loc.01858">December 22, 1874</a>, Reid promised to "have a
                    paragraph within a day or two, which will I think relieve you of the idea that
                    we had any such intention." A complimentary notice appeared in the issue of
                    December 26, 1874; In his <a href="nyp.00356">January 7, 1875</a> letter
                    to Ellen O'Connor, Whitman referred to this notice as "the most flourishing puff
                    yet given me—&amp; from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">them!</span>" </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
