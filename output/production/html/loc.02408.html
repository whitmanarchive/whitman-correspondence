            <p class="tei_p"> It was a great shock to J. N. Johnson to have several men tell me when I last went
                to town that they were more or less sure they had seen in some newspaper notices of
                the death of Walt Whitman. I did not think, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​ , I should have failed to see it in those I had been reading. It is (as it
                has been) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the immeasurable thoughtfulness</span> of us two men
                that should make it the saddest of happenings if we two are never to meet.
                Obstacles, obstacles <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="though​ ">tho'</span>​ , are always getting in the way. It seems to me if I could see you shortly
                by going to your brother's at St Louis, Mo., I would like to go there. I could serve
                an important business end by a little travel I think—in some direction.</p>
