                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the
                    Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until
                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in
