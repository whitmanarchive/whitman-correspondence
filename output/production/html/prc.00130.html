            <p class="tei_p">Thanks, dear friend, &amp; to dear Mrs: I[ngram]—the fruit came this forenoon by express—all 
                safe—&amp; the bottles of wine ditto—thanks. Beautiful perfect weather here. I am still kept 
                in my sick room, (but no worse)—My book printing goes on smoothly—My "Notes," such as they 
                are, on E[lias] H[icks] among the rest—the bunch of golden rods on my table as I write—</p>
