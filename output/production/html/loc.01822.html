            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I did not get your letter of September 27th<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> till I was leaving for New England, and
                today I have yours of October 4th,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> which Nelly<a href="#n4137" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4137">3</a> sends me.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I felt so miserably unwell that I decided to try a vacation, and left Washington on
                the 30th of September for Providence, intending to come down at once here to the
                island of ConauientConneaut, opposite Newport, 
                where I now am. But a severe cold, and a week of unsettled and stormy weather delayed 
                me in Providence till the 6th, when 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.002_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01822.002_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.002_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01822.002_large_mflm.jpg</span> 
                I arrived here. I intended to stay at the Light House on the end of the island (Beaver 
                Tail L.H.) but the Keeper could not accommodate me, so I am boarding with a private family.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My purpose was to kill two birds with one stone—get well and fix up the
                "Carpenter",<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> but I fear neither are likely to be effected. I feel 
                wretchedly unwell, and can't think of composition. I never was so <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">tired</span> in my
                life, and am so sleepy that I drop off in slumber if I sit a few minutes in a
                chair—a new experience for me. I slept twelve hours last night, and after
                dinner today (one o'clock) fell asleep in a rocking chair 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.011_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01822.011_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.011_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01822.011_large_mflm.jpg</span> 
                and slept till six! I never felt such lethargy. I expect some day I shall fall asleep 
                like Rip Van Winkle or (more appropriately) the Sleeping Beauty, and my beard grow down 
                all over the rocks like sea-weed, and cover the sea, and my hair spread backward over the 
                island, and smother the inhabitants. Selah.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I shall probably leave here by the first of next week. I intended to stay longer, but
                it is dull and lonely to me, not feeling able to occupy myself with writing, and the
                beauty of the sea is half-lost and indifferent to my sick eyes. My only pleasure is
                a daily delicious 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.012_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01822.012_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.012_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01822.012_large_mflm.jpg</span> 
                swim in the ocean—all too-brief, for the water is too cold to stay in
                long—but oh, how good it is! It electrifies and braces me for a few minutes,
                but then I get dull and sleepy again.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">So far, thanks to not feeling well, I haven't had a good time at all.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Dear Walt, I hope you will come to Providence. Dr. Channing<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> and 
                Jeannie<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a> quite count upon it, and will be much gratified. I hope 
                you will be there while I am, and then we can go around. I shall return there about the 12th 
                or 13th, and if you fulfil your original intention, that will about bring us together at that time.</p>

                though I think I had better wait a few days now, hoping to feel better, and therefore in a better 
                mood. Perhaps, I had better wait till I see you in Providence, if you decide to come on there, 
                and then we can talk it over, and arrange just what is best to say.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Swinton's<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">8</a> discovery of the resemblance in form between Leaves of Grass 
                and Blake's<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">9</a> poetry, is in my humble opinion, a mare's nest of the first water. (Irish!!) The
                resemblance is extremely superficial—about as much as 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.008_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01822.008_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.008_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01822.008_large_mflm.jpg</span> 
                between the Gregorian chant, bellowed by bull-necked priests with donkey lips, and a 
                first-class, infinitely varied, complex-melodied Italian opera, sung by voices 
                half-human, half-divine. Such assertions as Swinton's exasperate me. All that resides 
                in the matter is just this: Bishop South<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">10</a> had translated the Hebrew prophets into 
                verse of unequal length, following the original, whose metres are interior, the accords being of 
                sense and not sound, and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this, as regards mere external form, Blake imitated undoubtedly</span>. The 
                verse of Leaves of Grass has just so much superficial resemblance to Bishop South's translations, 
                and the imitations of 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf004r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.009_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01822.009_large_mflm.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01822.009_large_mflm.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01822.009_large_mflm.jpg</span> 
                Blake, as results from their all being <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">unequal in length</span>, and no more. 
                For my part, I should as soon think of the form of Leaves of Grass in 
                connexion with that of 
                Southey's<a href="#n3050" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3050">11</a> Thalaba, as with anything of the South-Blake pattern. It differs radically and 
                palpably to the eye, to the ear, and above all to the mind, from anything before it.</p>

                and I don't understand how a man can write such things at all, much less about a person with whom 
                he pretends to be on friendly terms. I think you must spear him with a look when you next meet him,

                about when we meet. It made me feel quite
                anxious, but I guess all's right, while Ashton is there. Pleasants is a miserable
                devil. I wish I had power in that office for a little while. I'd put a spoke in the

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the

                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or

                    uprising of 1830. He immigrated to the United States in 1849. From 1862 to 1866,
                    while living in Washington, D.C., he published an eccentric three-volume Diary,
                    a day-by-day account of the American Civil War written with a marked partiality
                    toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he covered his
                    lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a powerful topknot,
                    in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.11.html">Sunday, November 11, 1888</a>, 79, and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.14.html">Wednesday, November 14, 1888</a>, 96).

                    intervals." Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a
