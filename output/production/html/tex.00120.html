         </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I see by this morning's paper, that Starr &amp; Co. has taken the contract for the 36 in pipes for Washington &amp; I am thinking of trying to get the inspecting of them. Genl Greene I understand is appointed Chief Eng'r of the Dept. of Public Wks, but Major Elliot has the immediate charge of Water Dept.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Do you know Maj. Elliot and if so can you find out from him if he has any particular person that he wants to inspect the pipes. I would like to find out if it would be of any use for me to go to Washington &amp; see him in regard to the matter. I do not care to go unless I have a good show for the work. I could refer him to Mr Kirkwood, Genl Greene, Mr Lane, Col Adams, Mr. Tracy, Davis &amp;C. Walt cant you stop here on your return to Washington, Â if you could only bring Mother we would be delighted.
