                that appears officially in the transaction. He will never endure to be exclusively

            <p class="tei_p">You must be careful in what you say of Emerson's position toward your amative
                passages. You have often told us that in his talk with you on the Common he had
                nothing to say on intrinsic grounds against these passages, but only on commercial
                or popular grounds. I remember your telling me that it was the saddest thing you

                nothing to urge in all his vehement talk, but that the exclusion
                of these passages would make the book sell better. Nor could he have had. These
                passages are capable of the most unanswerable vindication on purely intellectual
