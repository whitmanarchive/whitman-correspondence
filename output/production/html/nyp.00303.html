            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter this forenoon, &amp; went over to New York to see about the trunks—finally found the man in charge of expressage on board the Mary Powell, who said that he took them up to Rondout on the Powell yesterday, &amp; landed them, to be forwarded to you—So I take it that they have all reached you safely before you get this.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I expect to be on hand at Hanover on Wednesday afternoon 26th—it is middle or latter part of the afternoon I am to be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">on exhibition</span>—shall hope to see you, dear friend, on the great occasion<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
