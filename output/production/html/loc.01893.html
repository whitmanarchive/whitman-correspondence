                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
                    critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
                    responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
                    Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
                    Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors. . . . Bard of America, and
                    Bard of democracy." In 1888, Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man:
                    but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we
                    connect" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    Rossetti had called attention to the "highly respectful references" to

                    These references included two prefatory quotations from Whitman, even though

                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
