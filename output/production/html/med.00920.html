                        was supplied by William R. Langfield of Philadelphia to Professor Rollo G. Silver in 1936. At the time, Langfield was in 
                        possession of the manuscript letter.</span> 
                The transcription presented here is derived from  Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York University Press, 1961–1977), 211.
