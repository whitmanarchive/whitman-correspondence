            <p class="tei_p">Am sitting here a while to contrast the fearful tedium of lying in bed so
                long—eking a half hour more, to sit up here—though slowly &amp;
                moderately, seems to me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I am decidedly better</span>, wh' sums all
                at present—seem to fall from one pit to a lower pit—what is to come
                remains to be seen—Dr Walsh (who is not very definitive)
                says it is an extreme case (this very last) of prostration &amp; gastric trouble
                from indigestion—Monday, Tuesday &amp; Wednesday last were worst—Tuesday
                was deathly—yesterday &amp; to-day I begin at milk &amp; broth &amp; sit up
                more—feel pretty fair as I sit here this moment—have drink'd some sherry
                mix'd with milk—(wine, whey)—Hope you have rec'd the copies of the big
                book, sent by Canadian Express (sent last Thursday)—Hope you are not
                disappointed (or vex'd) at its looks—as it is, for all nine-tenths of L of G.
                are from normal al fresco genesis (beef, meat, wine, sunny, lusty) and three fourths
                of the rest of the trilogy ditto—it is fished out of one of Dante's hells,
                considering my physical condition the last three months—</p>

                &amp; some chicken broth for breakfast—anticipated a pretty good day &amp; a
                good bath in the wash room, but not accomplish'd yet—Yours of 15th rec'd—Am sitting up—a dismal dark sticky
                rainy day—Suppose the big books must be to hand now—sweat easily, the
                least encouragement—quite great thirst—drink milk a good deal—have
                just eaten some vanilla ice cream—just rec'd an Italian (Palermo) paper—&amp; the Paris <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Revue
