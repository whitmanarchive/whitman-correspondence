                    letter in the hand of Richard Maurice Bucke is accurate, but the letter can be
                    dated a more narrow range, to between March 9 and March 14, 1863. The letter
                    followed Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's <a href="loc.00401">March 9,
                        1863</a> letter to Walt, which reported George Washington Whitman's
                    arrival in Brooklyn on "Sunday morning" (March 8) for a ten-day furlough. George
                    departed from Brooklyn the morning of March 17, the day his furlough ended (see
                    George's <a href="loc.00486">April 2, 1863</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman). In this letter, Louisa refers to Jeff's letter and twice asks Walt to
                    send the flannel shirts. She could have written no earlier than the same day as
                    Jeff's letter, March 9. If she expected the shirts to arrive before George's
                    expected departure from Brooklyn, she must have written no later than March 14.
                    This date range is confirmed also by Walt's <a href="wwh.00007">March 18,
                        1863</a> letter to Jeff, in which he reported having sent a packet with
                    George's shirts on March 15, 1863. Louisa's letter likely was not written on
                    neither end of the possible extremes, so between one day after Jeff's letter
                    (March 10) and four days before George's departure (March 13) is most likely as
                    the date of the letter. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00425_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman

                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    the paper is "awful stuf" on which to preserve a letter: it is slowly crumbling
                    away at edges and folds. To arrest the deterioration, a conservator at Duke
                    University has stabilized the document with backing, which is visible in the
                    reproduction. Many crumbled fragments are also preserved. Many words could only
                    be recovered from the letter itself by reassembling the document from a small
                    envelope of crumbled fragments. However, a typed transcription for each letter
