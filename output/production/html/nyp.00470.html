            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 15th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —J[ohn] B[urroughs] had written
                to me for the letter—he heard of it from Dowden himself)—Yes I too think
                D's words "sweet and beautiful"—I read yesterday the Dec. "Nineteenth Century"
                article (Josiah Child, of Trübner's, mailed me in sheets)—&amp; like it
                much—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">You</span> may not, on <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="account​ ">acct</span>​  of the author's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Bull reservations</span>, but I think it decidedly the best
                English (or any foreign) criticism yet printed. I will send you a copy (of the cheap
                N Y reprint) in two or three days—it was not ready last night—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">William, as you are going to collect the "Tribune" letters, &amp;c. I suggest that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you ask Dr Bucke to
                    give up the</span> "Good Gray," &amp; you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">include
                it</span>—make a cluster of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">all</span> you have written (Have

                I have a copy, &amp; can send you)—I think it would be just as well for you to
                so include, as Dr B has enough otherways—I hope you will like the
                idea—shall I ask Dr. B to give it up? there is something to me quite
                preferable in these <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">collectanea</span> at first hand for a life,
                affair, even history, out of which the modern intelligent reader, (a new race
                unknown before our time) can take and adapt &amp; shape for him or herself—I
                send you the "Critic" with my piece on Burns—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Cold, cold—but very bright &amp; sunny here to-day—I am well as
                usual—Wonder how the Heywood trial will eventuate—Somehow I feel clear
                that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">however</span> it goes, we will "pluck the flower" &amp;c
                &amp;c from that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">however</span>—So you must not feel anxious a
                bit—T W H Rolleston at Dresden, Saxony (with one or two German scholars) is
                translating L of G. into <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">full German version</span>—expecting it to be ready next spring—He is
                an Irish gentleman, a college man, about 30 I think, married, &amp; I suppose of
                some fortune—What I know of him (by quite considerable correspondence) I like
                much.</p>
