      <p class="tei_p">John, I have just been reading your <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> article,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> seated by the open window front room in my shirt sleeves, &amp;
        must write a word about it—Your late pieces show <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">marked
          vitality—vivacity</span> (struggling, almost chafing, underneath a continent,
        respectable form or exterior) &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this is the best of
        them</span>—has those peculiarities, not without one or two foibles, but the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whole</span> of the piece is glorious—leaves the impression now upon me
        (after two readings) of the noblest piece of criticism on these things yet in
        America—as much nobler than the superb Emersonian pages on those subjects as lines
        &amp; opinions with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the blood of life</span> &amp; throb of hot conviction
        in them, are nobler than the superbest <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Marble–statue
        lines</span>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It would be possible that I might be swayed into a warm feeling about the piece by the
        magnificent &amp; very 'cute page about me,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> but as it happens by
        accident I had look'd over &amp; read the piece in parts, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">accidentally omitting at
          first the entire lines in the second column</span> of the page about me (which finally
        please me best)—&amp; had made up my mind very decidedly as aforesaid—then when
        I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">did</span> read them, you can imagine they <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">didn't</span>
        hurt me much—nor my estimation of the piece—<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have much to write—or tell you—about my own concerns—things in
        England—here too—&amp;c &amp;c—have been waiting for the chance to write
        you fully ever since I got your kind generous note &amp; present<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—but it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span></span> seem to occur—Physically I am not much different—get along about as
        well as usual these times—am now just going down to an old farm house &amp; big

                    sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
                    George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
                    War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
                    was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
                    Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
                        "<a href="per.00209">Our Brooklyn Boys in the War</a>" (January 5,
                    1863); "<a href="per.00212">A Brooklyn Soldier, and a Noble One</a>"
                    (January 19, 1865); "<a href="per.00205">Return of a Brooklyn Veteran</a>"
                    (March 12, 1865); and "<a href="per.00206">Our Veterans Mustering Out</a>"
                    (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
                    houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
                    George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
                    and George lived together for over a decade in Camden, but when Walt decided not
                    to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
                    ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
