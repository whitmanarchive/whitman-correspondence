      <p class="tei_p">John, I have just been reading your <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> article, seated by the open window front room in my shirt sleeves, &amp;
        must write a word about it—Your late pieces show <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">marked
          vitality—vivacity</span> (struggling, almost chafing, underneath a continent,
        respectable form or exterior) &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this is the best of
        them</span>—has those peculiarities, not without one or two foibles, but the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whole</span> of the piece is glorious—leaves the impression now upon me
        (after two readings) of the noblest piece of criticism on these things yet in
        America—as much nobler than the superb Emersonian pages on those subjects as lines
        &amp; opinions with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the blood of life</span> &amp; throb of hot conviction
        in them, are nobler than the superbest <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Marble–statue
        lines</span>—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It would be possible that I might be swayed into a warm feeling about the piece by the
        magnificent &amp; very 'cute page about me, but as it happens by
        accident I had look'd over &amp; read the piece in parts, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">accidentally omitting at
          first the entire lines in the second column</span> of the page about me (which finally
        please me best)—&amp; had made up my mind very decidedly as aforesaid—then when
        I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">did</span> read them, you can imagine they <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">didn't</span>
        hurt me much—nor my estimation of the piece—
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have much to write—or tell you—about my own concerns—things in
        England—here too—&amp;c &amp;c—have been waiting for the chance to write
        you fully ever since I got your kind generous note &amp; present—but it <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​
        
      </span></span> seem to occur—Physically I am not much different—get along about as
        well as usual these times—am now just going down to an old farm house &amp; big
        family, down in Jersey at <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">White Horse</span>, to
        spend a couple of days—and it is now (4½ p m) while I am waiting for the hack to
        come &amp; take me to the depot that I write this—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">George and Lou are well—baby only pretty
        well—hot weather, &amp; teething—(but behaves like a little hero)—expect
        my two nieces here next week from St Louis—Love to
          'Sula—Write soon—</p>
