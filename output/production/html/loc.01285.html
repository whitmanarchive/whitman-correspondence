                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I send the article on Democracy. If satisfactory I should like $100 for it. You are
                to issue it in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> with exclusive possession of the field,
                say for three months—after which I reserve to myself the right of any further use of
                it—as, for instance, issuing it with added Notes, Appendices, &amp;c. in a pamphlet
                or small book—published by you, of course, if you are willing—I to receive copyright
                fee on sales, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But we can see better how the cat jumps after the article is before the public—&amp;
                will leave that question open until then.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Please have it set up forthwith, read carefully by copy, &amp; then, after
                correction, send me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">two good proofs</span>. I want it to go forth in
                a perfect verbal &amp;c. condition.</p>

                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">Walt Whitman.</span>
            </span>

            

                <p class="tei_p">Please acknowledge this, immediately on reception.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">If any thing could be made by disposing of advance sheets in London, to any
                    magazine or publisher, I would suggest that it be done—the price procured to be
                    divided equally between you &amp; me.</p>
