            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I send the article on Democracy. If satisfactory I should like $100 for it. You are
                to issue it in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> with exclusive possession of the field,
                say for three months—after which I reserve to myself the right of any further use of
                it—as, for instance, issuing it with added Notes, Appendices, &amp;c. in a pamphlet
                or small book—published by you, of course, if you are willing—I to receive copyright
                fee on sales, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">But we can see better how the cat jumps after the article is before the public—&amp;
                will leave that question open until then.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Please have it set up forthwith, read carefully by copy, &amp; then, after
                correction, send me <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">two good proofs</span>. I want it to go forth in
                a perfect verbal &amp;c. condition.</p>

            </span>

            

                <p class="tei_p">Please acknowledge this, immediately on reception.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">If any thing could be made by disposing of advance sheets in London, to any
                    magazine or publisher, I would suggest that it be done—the price procured to be
                    divided equally between you &amp; me.</p>

                    (1839–1906) established the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> in 1866 with his
                    brother William Conant Church (1836–1917). Financial control of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span> passed to Sheldon &amp; Company in 1868, and the magazine
                    was absorbed by the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Atlantic Monthly</span> in 1878. In 1897, Francis
                    Church famously wrote, "Yes, Virginia, there
                    is a Santa Claus" for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> in response to a letter the paper received from
                    eight-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon. For more information on the Church brothers, see Edward
