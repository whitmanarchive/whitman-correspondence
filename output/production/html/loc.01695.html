                    <p class="tei_p">The Committee of the American Institute had written on <a href="loc.02858">August 1, 1871</a>, "to solicit of you the honor of
                        a poem on the occasion of its opening, September 7, 1871—with the
                        privilege of furnishing proofs of the same to the Metropolitan Press for
                        publication with the other proceedings.…We shall be most happy, of

                    <p class="tei_p">The newspaper coverage of Walt Whitman's appearance was extensive: the
                        Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Morning Chronicle</span> published the
                        poet's account on September 7, 1871; the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening
                            Post</span> reprinted the poem, later entitled <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00005.html">"After All, Not to Create Only,"</a> and called Walt Whitman "a good
                        elocutionist"; he was also praised in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span> and the Brooklyn <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Standard</span>; the New York
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> printed excerpts from the poem on
                        September 8, 1871, and later a devastating parody by Bayard Taylor
                        (reprinted in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Echo Club</span> [2nd ed., 1876],
                        169–170); the Springfield <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Republican</span> published
                        the poem on September 9, 1871. In reply to the criticisms of the poem, Walt
                        Whitman prepared the following for submission to an unidentified newspaper:
                        "The N. Y. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">World's</span> frantic, feeble, fuddled articles
                        on it are curiosities. The <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Telegram</span> dryly calls it
                        the longest conundrum ever yet given to the public" (Yale). See also Horace
