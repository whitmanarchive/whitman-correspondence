            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I yesterday received your kind note. I gladly accept your invitation &amp; hospitality. 
                My leave of absence continues for some time yet, &amp; I should probably like to visit you 
                for a few days, just subsequently to the middle of October—But I will write you a day or two before I come.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I send my best respects &amp; love to Mrs. Channing. As I write we are having a rainy, 
                dark sulky Sunday—after a rainy night. I am well &amp; quietly enjoying holiday.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you &amp; wife to read my last piece in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Broadway</span> 
                London Magazine for October. You can get it at any good bookstand.
