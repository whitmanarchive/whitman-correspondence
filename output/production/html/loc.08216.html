            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 12<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> and 14<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> enclosing Miss May Johnston's was received 
                and heartily welcomed today. Also the bundle 
             of news papers came duly to hand and I was very glad to get them. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">date</span> is cut off the N.Y. Recorder con'g 
                "Howards Letter" I want you or Horace to tell it me. I am glad H. 
                    has the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">tomb</span> matter in hand and have no 
                doubt he will soon straighten it up, seems to me clear that they were trying to impose on you but before they let this, they will 
                find that that is not so easy. All very quiet here—raining all day but remarkably warm for 16<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> Nov. 
                No frost of any account here yet but I guess we 
                shall soon see it cold now—I am not yet quite over Clare's Ball (13–14 inst) still a little stiff about the 
                back—but the young folk had a 
                big time &amp; enjoyed it.</p>
