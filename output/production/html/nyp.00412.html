            <p class="tei_p">Your letter dated 27th has reached me here, &amp; glad to get it—glad to hear you are having such good health this summer—as to that spell you speak of, no doubt it was the devilish lemonade &amp; cake—I always told you you was too heedless in the eating &amp; drinking, (sometimes going without too long, &amp;c)—(I tell you what, Harry, it is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">stomach, belly</span> &amp; liver that make the principal foundation of all <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">feeling well</span>—with one other thing)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">The little piece "Will it Happen"? is real good—stick away at it, dear son—write little pieces of your thoughts, or what you see, off-hand, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">at the time</span>—(that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">always</span> puts <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">life</span> into 'em)—Keep pegging away<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Day before yesterday I spent aboard the great ship <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Minnesota</span>, (big enough for a thousand people)—it was all very enjoyable—the officers all my friends right off—I took dinner with them at a big table in what they call the Ward Room—Some splendid young fellows—some jolly old roosters—lots of fun, yarns &amp;c—every thing good to eat, &amp; plenty of it—What I liked best though was rowing in the boat to &amp; from the ship, man-of-war fashion—(In my last letter in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> you will see a ¶ about the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Minnesota</span>, my first visit)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I got a letter from my sister yesterday from Camden—all as usual there—Mrs Gilchrist was there last Saturday, she said—I suppose Herbert is still with you—I <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  his letter—he seemed to be having royal times there—Beatrice G[ilchrist] is here—she called on me here—Hank, you speak about my not writing oftener—this is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">third</span> letter<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I have written to you from here, &amp; papers three or four times—Yours of yesterday is the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">second</span> <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  here from you—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">let them read this letter if they care to</span>—I shall probably be back last of next week—come up, my darling boy—</p>
