            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Cyril Flower wrote to me some time ago to inform me that he had brought your
                books with him from America, a gift from you, and that they were lying in my London
                chambers; Whereupon I wrote back to him, begging him to bring them himself to me at
                my country house, and I have been accordingly, always expecting to see him, but he
                never came, being detained by law business in town. I have now just called at my
                London lodgings, and found them on the table. I had previously met with several of
                your works and read them with interest and had made up my mind that you had a large
                and lovable nature. I discovered great "go" in your writings and am not surprised at
                the hold they have taken on your fellow country men.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wishing you all success and prosperity, and with all thanks for your kind gift which I should have acknowledged earlier, had I received it sooner, I remain</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">

            </span>

            
                <p class="tei_p">I trust that if you visit England, you will grant me the pleasure of receiving
                    and entertaining you under my own roof.</p>

                    letter to Walt Whitman. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870,
                    probably shortly after the visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the
                    letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the

                    reply on <a href="med.00411">April 27, 1872</a>, Tennyson wrote a second
                    letter on September 22, 1871, also apparently lost. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00410_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00410_n2"><span>Sylvester Baxter reported
                    that in April, 1881, Walt Whitman had informed Trowbridge and himself of his
