                <span class="tei_salute">My dear Sir:</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Cyril Flower wrote to me some time ago to inform me that he had brought your
                books with him from America, a gift from you, and that they were lying in my London
                chambers; Whereupon I wrote back to him, begging him to bring them himself to me at
                my country house, and I have been accordingly, always expecting to see him, but he
                never came, being detained by law business in town. I have now just called at my
                London lodgings, and found them on the table. I had previously met with several of
                your works and read them with interest and had made up my mind that you had a large
                and lovable nature. I discovered great "go" in your writings and am not surprised at
                the hold they have taken on your fellow country men.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Wishing you all success and prosperity, and with all thanks for your kind gift which I should have acknowledged earlier, had I received it sooner, I remain</p>

            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Ever yours, very truly,</span>
                <span class="tei_signed tei_signed_rend_right">A Tennyson</span>
            </span>

            
                <p class="tei_p">I trust that if you visit England, you will grant me the pleasure of receiving
                    and entertaining you under my own roof.</p>
