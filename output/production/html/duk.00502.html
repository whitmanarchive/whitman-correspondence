            felt as if he would like to loaf and
            live at his ease
            there was no particular
            need as i told him of his going to work so
            soon but he seemed inclined to doo so
            i shall be glad when i get down town on
            his account it is
            so far up here he has had
            a wonderfull appetite after being sick but
            its not so good now but that is nothing strange
            his face dont appear to bloat any more
                we have letters from Jeff
                quite often
            he worries very much about matti and
            the children and mammy i told mat
            to not write every thing to worry him
            it would doo us no good but you know
            how mat is she has certainly not had a
            beginning of work to doo but she has felt not very
                well and very fretful it
                <span class="unclear written over tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_written tei_unclear_reason_over tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">is</span> amusing
                to see the folks wach us to see if we make
            any preperations to move but nary a word
            doo they speak i dont think they would be
                quite so bad if mrs beecher 
                   hadent given
            them directions the other day the girl went out
            and they tied one door with a rope and locked
            the other edd
                went down to get a pail of water
            but couldent get in i told him to go to the hydrant
                matt said he shouldent so she went down <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">stairs</span>
            and got the key i should move if the place was
            finished as small as it is but it has to be paint<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ed</span>
            and it would be so bad but i think i
            would be very much better of there than
                here the place has had very many improvemen<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ts</span>
