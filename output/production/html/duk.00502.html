                    20, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "Thursday" and explained to
                    Walt that she expected to move from the 840 Pacific Street home on the "last of
                    June." Since she directed Walt to send "next weeks letter" to the same address,
                    this letter must date at least one week before her move at the end of June 1867.
                    Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date June 20, 1867, and June 20 fell on a
                    Thursday, the day of the week in her hand, in 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller also
                    dated a letter from Louisa to Walt Whitman to June 20, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 1:378). The letter is consistent with Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
                    Whitman's expected departure from the Pacific Street house and with the Thursday
                    that preceded the end-of-June move, so the date assigned by Bucke and Miller is
                    correct. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
