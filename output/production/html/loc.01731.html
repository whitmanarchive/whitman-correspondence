                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Sir,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have taken the liberty to send you by this post a copy of Mr. Swinburne's new book
                upon <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">William Blake</span>, poet and artist—a great but
                neglected genius who was counted as a madman by his contemporaries here sixty years
                ago. As Mr. Swinburne makes mention of yourself in this, his most recent published
                composition, it is but right that you should see what is said. But irrespective of
                that I feel assured—from what Mr. M. D. Conway tells me—that the book
                will interest you.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01731.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01731.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01731.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">Mr Conway will have told you of our intention to publish an English edition of your
                "poems"—or rather a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"selection"</span> from
                them—edited by Mr. W. M. Rossetti, one of our most able critics, and himself a
                poet. In about a week I shall send you a copy by post. It makes a handy vol. of
                about 440 pages, &amp; will I think be a favourite here. Mr. Rossetti's introduction is most admirable, and gives great
                satisfaction to your admirers and his friends.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Now, we want the privilege of selling copies of this "selection" in 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01731.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01731.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01731.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> the United States—if you will allow us: and I have told Mr. Conway that I would give you—or your agent—a royalty of one shilling (or 25 cents gold) upon every copy
                sold in your country.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I imagine that the sale of this "selection" in your country would serve as whet, or
                stimulant, to readers to secure copies of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">complete</span>
                works. I really don't think it would materially interfere with the sale of the
                latter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">On this English edition I will ask your acceptance of a share of our
                profits—after the original outlay in paper, printing, &amp; binding, has been
                    <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01731.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01731.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01731.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>returned to the
                publisher.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I was greatly gratified this afternoon in having almost the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">first</span> copy of Mr. Robert Buchanan's new vol. of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">"Essays"</span> placed in my hands. I was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gratified</span>
                because in the middle of the book his admirable paper upon your "poems—the
                article <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="which​ ">wch</span>​  recently appeared in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Broadway</span>—is
                given.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think, in conclusion, that I ought to apologise for sending this familiarly written
                letter to you, as I am but a trader—a bookseller—and have only an
                acquaintance with your books of some years standing to offer as an excuse. True,
                the first copies imported into this country were at the order of the undersigned;
                but, that, it is feared, will not in any way palliate the liberty now taken.</p>
