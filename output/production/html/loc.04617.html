            <p class="tei_p">I am the owner of and read much in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">interdicted</span> edition of your <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>.</p>
    
    <p class="tei_p">That reading has resulted in the poem contained in the number of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Cornell Era</span> mailed with this. Give it three minutes time and tell me if you like it.</p>

                        <span class="tei_l">Why, at first sight, did we like one another?</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">The beams which joined your eyes to mine</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Transmitted, by forces within us, sight, sound, taste and smell.</span>
                    </span>

                        <span class="tei_l">As weak as the body that holds it—</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">The last one and young one, I mean.</span>
                    </span>

                        <span class="tei_l">But—a moment—is this not the reason?</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Perhaps it is only a duty you owe me,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">The return of a love which I, as a father or mother of ages ago,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Gave to you, then a weakling, the son of an immortal union.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">Or, may be, the look that we think the first one and one of strange power,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Is the continuation of one that was stopped by the sacrifice flames,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">As they mounted and withered the flesh from our bones.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">How we, two atoms of the mound-building wave of mankind,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Two hardy young warriors, shielded in bright-hammered copper</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">And decked out in strings of the far ocean's shells,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Wielded the flint-sword with serrated edges;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Fought the encroaching tribe on the east.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">We were conquered and taken as captives, to work on the slowly raised tumuli.</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">To the mines at the north were we driven in summer;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">There, scourged every day, we toiled side by side in the pits.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">And we two, bowed under jagged lumps of the metal,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Took our place, side by side, in the far-stretching line of the abject,</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">To march through the hazy and gay shrouded forests to our home in the midland.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">Sacred fires were kindled atop the alter-topped mound;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">You and I, captives and slaves, were the off'rings;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Up the steep-graded ways of the mound, we toiled mid a throng of shrill shrieking priests.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">The summit reached we looked on the multitude far, far below.</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">We discerned far below us a clamoring swarm;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">A million of up-turned faces; a saffron-hued mass;</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Yellow faces, bright hammered copper, the muddy flood by melted snows swollen, that flowed o'er the plain.</span>

                        <span class="tei_l">A look that we, with false fear, thought the last.</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">I heard the shouts of the turbulent mass far below.</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Sheets of flame beat against the warmth of affection</span>
                        <span class="tei_l">Envious that aught to themselves might be comparable;</span>
