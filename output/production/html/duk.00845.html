            <p class="tei_p">Major Pond has written to me fixing dates for my proposed Boston (including I believe
                Hartford &amp; New Haven) lecturing tourâ€”but I am

                every day. Have just sent a poem to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nineteenth
                    Century</span>. Love to you all.</p>
