                    John Burroughs, and Richard Maurice Bucke were
                    three of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy (1850–1929) first
                    met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> in 1880, and would go on to write a book-length study of the
                    poet. Burroughs (1837–1921), a naturalist, met Whitman in Washington, D.C.
                    in 1864 and became one of Whitman's most frequent correspondents. He would also
                    go on to write several studies of Whitman. Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian
                    physician, was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his
                    medical advisors and literary executors. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n3112">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n3112 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n3112"><span>James Burton Pond (1838–1903)
                    was a famous lecture-manager and printer. He was also awarded the Medal of Honor
                    for his services in the Civil War. In his 1900 autobiography <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Eccentricities of Genius</span> (G. W. Dillingham Co: New York), he writes of
                    Whitman: "Whitman gave a few readings under my management during his life. They
                    were mostly testimonials from friends, and benefits given in the theatres of New
                    York City"; Pond concludes with an anecdote about the poet's meeting with Sir
                    Edwin Arnold (497–501). </span></span> [<a href="#r3112">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00845_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="duk.00845_n1"><span>On <a href="loc.03486">April 25, 1887</a>, Pond proposed to Whitman a reading
