                &amp; spend the season on the
                old home farm. I seem
                to have felt a shadow creeping
                over me for some years,
                &amp; this is what it means.
                But I shall not lose heart:
                I shall try to gain some of your
                own cheerfulness &amp; serenity.
                I wish much I could see
                you. If you had only sent
                me word that day, I was
                on the point of coming over,
                but felt sure I should
                miss you if I did.
