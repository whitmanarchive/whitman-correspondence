            <p class="tei_p">Two or three little matters I will write to you about.
                How is the publication of the German version getting on? My guess would be that when
                fairly afloat it might have quite as much sale here in the United States as in
                Germany—perhaps more. Would of course require a little while to get bruited
                about—but then I think quite probable a steady demand would set in. Two or
                three central book jobbing houses should be fixed upon, one in New York, one in
                Chicago, &amp; one in San Francisco—</p>
            <div class="tei_p p">With an eye to this I would like early copies sent to
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">Wm Sloane Kennedy, Belmont, Mass:</li><li class="tei_item">J L &amp; J B Gilder, Critic office, 18 Astor Place New York City</li><li class="tei_item">Prof. Edward Dowden, Temple Road Winstead Rathmine's, Dublin Ireland</li><li class="tei_item">Talcott Williams, Daily Press cor 7th &amp; Chestnut Sts Phila</li><li class="tei_item">Editors, Daily Republican newspaper Springfield Mass</li><li class="tei_item">Dr Karl Knortz cor Morris av and 155th st New York</li><li class="tei_item">R W Gilder Century Magazine, Union Sq N Y</li></ul>
            All the above would quite certainly announce and review the German trans.</div>
