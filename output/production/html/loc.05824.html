                How is the publication of the German version getting on? My guess would be that when
                fairly afloat it might have quite as much sale here in the United States as in
                Germany—perhaps more. Would of course require a little while to get bruited
                about—but then I think quite probable a steady demand would set in. Two or
                three central book jobbing houses should be fixed upon, one in New York, one in
                Chicago, &amp; one in San Francisco—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With an eye to this I would like early copies sent to
            <ul class=" tei_list"><li class="tei_item">Wm Sloane Kennedy, Belmont, Mass:</li><li class="tei_item">J L &amp; J B Gilder, Critic office, 18 Astor Place New York City</li><li class="tei_item">Prof. Edward Dowden, Temple Road Winstead Rathmine's, Dublin Ireland</li><li class="tei_item">Talcott Williams, Daily Press cor 7th &amp; Chestnut Sts Phila</li><li class="tei_item">Editors, Daily Republican newspaper Springfield Mass</li><li class="tei_item">Dr Karl Knortz cor Morris av and 155th st New York</li><li class="tei_item">R W Gilder Century Magazine, Union Sq N Y</li></ul>
            All the above would quite certainly announce and review the German trans.</p>

                    (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
                    Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    the German edition, he was not able to publish it (see the letter from Whitman
