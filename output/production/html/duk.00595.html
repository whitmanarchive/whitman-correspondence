                    1870. The date June 1 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
                    date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New
                    York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The year 1870 is consistent with
                    a thumb injury and infection that Walt Whitman suffered in late April or early
                    May 1870, and Louisa inquired about Walt's thumb in several letters between May
                    and July. The death of a butcher named Richard Hunt and the appearance of an
                    article on Whitman by Anne Gilchrist are also consistent with the year. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
                    Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

The Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Radical</span> was a Unitarian periodical edited by Sidney H.
                    Morse (1833–1903). Gilchrist's "Woman's Estimate" was based on letters
                    that Gilchrist wrote to William Michael Rossetti after he edited for publication
                        <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems by Walt Whitman</span></a> (London: Hotten,
                    1868). According to Jerome M. Loving, Rossetti encouraged Gilchrist to have her
                    enthusiastic letters published and forwarded them to William D. O'Connor.
                    O'Connor initially contacted William C. Church and Francis P. Church, editors of
                    the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Galaxy</span>. After they rejected Gilchrist's piece,

                    residents engaged in unofficial observations (see "From Washington," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span>, May 30, 1870, 3). According to Drew

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
