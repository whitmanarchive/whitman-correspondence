                marvelous. I graze in them with my eyes daily.

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    married John Burroughs in 1857 and became a friend to Walt Whitman, a frequent
                    guest in the Burroughs household. When issues of sexual incompatibility arose in
                    the Burroughs marriage, Whitman sided with Ursula against John's sexual
                    "wantonness" and eventual infidelity. While John Burroughs traveled a great deal
                    due to his job as a bank examiner, Ursula and Whitman visited frequently, with
                    Ursula visiting the poet after his stroke in 1873. For more on Whitman's
