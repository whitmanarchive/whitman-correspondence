                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter, &amp; the papers you so kindly
                sent me, both very welcome. The sight of the Washington papers forthwith induces a
                fit of homesickness on poor 'Suly who seems to pine for the
                place &amp; our old home there more than I do. I have got somewhat wonted here,
                &amp; then I am busy &amp; have many things to interest me, &amp; she has little or
                nothing. Then the home in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">W.</span>​  was of course more to her than to me; her time was all passed there &amp;
                only a part of mine. Still at times my thoughts will go back
                
                &amp; hover &amp; nestle about the little home &amp; the many familiar places. I
                expect it will be a good while before Either of <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00001.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr.00001.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00001.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> us are weaned from <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">W.</span>​  I am about to sell the place. The bargain can be closed whenever I come on
                which will be by Sunday I think. Then we will be quite homeless again &amp; I expect
                the wife will be unhappy enough. I hope to be in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">W.</span>​  on Sunday evening, or Monday morning. I was grieved dear Walt that you was
                still confined to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">W.</span>​  &amp; not able to go home; but your faith in your ultimate entire recovery
                is cheering. I hope it may be more speedy. I look
                forward to many delightful days with you yet, after I have built me another nest up
                here by the Hudson You will come and spend weeks &amp; months with us &amp; we will
                all be happy again.
                 The
                spring is backward here; no lilacs yet &amp; no signs of any. But the grass, the
                good green grass, is wonderful. It seems as if I never saw it so perfect before.
                This you know is a great grazing &amp; butter country, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00001.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr.00001.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00001.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> &amp; the fields &amp; the spread
                of farms around are delightful to behold. They have something of the smooth, mellow,
                well kept look of the English fields, while their freshness &amp; tenderness are
                marvelous. I graze in them with my eyes daily.
                
                Grass like this is never seen so far south on the Potomac. Yesterday I made a trip
                to Sugar loaf Mountain 15 miles below here, &amp; could see
                over nearly the whole county from its summit, &amp; could see the Catskills 50
                miles to the North, &amp; peaks that I recognized as visible from my <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">parents​ </span><span class="tei_corr">parents'​
        
      </span></span> home in Delaware <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="County​ ">Co</span>​ . 
                But the rolling succession of green fields was the most wonderful.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have plenty of time on my hands now, but do not seem able to turn it to any account
                in a literary way. I am like a cow that has lost her "cud." I can't get back my
                ruminating habit.
                 If I could only
                begin once more I think there are several pieces I could write. I have <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00001.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr.00001.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr.00001.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> seen my father
                make an artificial cud for a cow, but I know of no receipt by which I can compound
                an intellectual one for myself.
                
                The first of my bird pieces with Scribner will not be out till
                July; when "The Birds of the Poets" will be out I have not heard.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I take the "Tribune" so had seen the letter about Emerson. I am glad the old fellow is having a good time. Conway is no doubt happy.</p>
