                    English poet. Noel came from an aristocratic English family, and in his youth
                    developed socialist sympathies. He was a close friend of the poet and
                    influential critic Robert Buchanan, and it may have been through Buchanan that

                    critic, had lauded Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Broadway Annual</span> in
                    1867, and in 1872 praised Whitman but attributed his poor reception in England
                    to the sponsorship of William Michael Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne.
                    See Harold Blodgett, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman in England</span> (1934),
                    79–80, and Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span>
                    (1955), 445–446. Swinburne's recantation later in 1872 may be partly
                    attributable to Buchanan's injudicious remarks. For more on Buchanan, see Philip
