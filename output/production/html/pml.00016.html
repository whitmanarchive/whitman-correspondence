            <p class="tei_p">I sent you a telegram, ten minutes ago, telling you that I have just succeeded in getting an order from the Attorney General for Mr. Parker's pardon.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> The pardon will probably go from here, (from the State Department,) on Monday next—the day you will receive this note—it will be directed to the Jail at Plymouth. I have had much more of a struggle than I anticipated—the pardon clerk knew the case, &amp; was filled with Mr. Dana's<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> reports upon it. When we meet, (or perhaps by letter, before) I will give you a more detailed account of the progress of the affair here, &amp; its fluctuations. But no matter—it has ended successfully.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have written to Aurelia Parker, &amp; sent the news, the same mail as this.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">In the office, &amp; my work, every thing goes on as usual. We are having delicious weather, coolish &amp; bright.
Has Arthur<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> gone, then? Well you will value him all the more, when you have him again.</p>

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
                    the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's Monthly</span> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
                    deeply." For more information on Whitman and Abby H.

                    interested in the case of Erastus Otis Parker, as Helen Price wrote years later,
                    "through his niece an intimate friend who beleived most absolutely in her
                    Uncle's innocence" (Pierpont Morgan Library). They asked Whitman to investigate
                    the circumstances of Parker's conviction and to appeal for a pardon. See
                    Whitman's <a href="nar.00003">October 26, 1866</a> letter to Henry

                    (1815–1882), author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Years Before the Mast</span>,
                    was the United States attorney for the district of Massachusetts from 1861 to
                    1866. On July 9, 1864, Dana informed Montgomery Blair, Postmaster General, that
                    a pardon was being requested for Parker "on the ground of failing health." On
                    March 19, 1866, in a letter to M. F. Pleasants, pardon clerk in Whitman's office
                    (see Whitman's letter from <a href="yal.00096">August 25, 1866</a>
                    , Dana explained what
                    had transpired two years earlier: "Parker's friends tried to get President
                    Lincoln to issue a pardon without its coming to his knowledge that Parker had
                    admitted his guilt; and for that purpose, contrived to get the thing out of the
                    regular track of the Pardon Bureau, with a report from me. I think they did get
                    an order for a pardon, conditioned on Mr. Blair's assent. But, Mr. Blair sent
                    the papers to me; and when the President learned the facts, and the deception
                    that had been practiced upon him, he revoked the order. . . . The case is a very
                    bad one, almost as bad in the fraudulent attempts to get signatures and a
                    pardon, as in the original guilt" (National Archives). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00016_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00016_n5"><span>Abby's son, Arthur,
