            <p class="tei_p">I have been quite unwell, or I should have ans'd you sooner. Yours of Nov. 26th, with
                check for Twenty Dollars, ($20) (herewith returned) was duly rec'd—Thank you
                most fervently, my friend—But I don't feel at all like writing a notice or
                biography of Halleck—(nor indeed capacitated for
                it)—I met H. once in Park Place, N. Y. &amp; remember his looks &amp;
                talk—but I dont think I can write ab't him—Thank you &amp; the Messrs:
                Appleton—Please send me word of the rec't of this—</p>
