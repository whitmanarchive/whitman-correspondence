            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I see in the papers, with agitation and alarm, the reports about your illness, which,
                however, are so vague that I can hope they are exaggerations, and that you are no
                worse than when you sent me the postal card of the 18th of May. You were bad enough then, God knows, and I felt downcast
                at your condition, though trusting that it was no more than an ill turn, which would
                pass. I would have written to you earlier, but have had several hideous days myself,
                and been unfit to write.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One paper speaks of Mr. Bucke as being with you. I hope this is
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Doctor</span> Bucke, and that he may have come down to you from
                    Canada.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wait anxiously to hear how you are. If I were not so badly
                crippled—especially the last few days—I would try to come and hear for
                myself. But I should be in the way, considering my condition.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If Doctor Bucke is with you, I hope he will pencil me a word, if he can.</p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Hurriedly, but with fervent hopes and wishes, always affectionately</span>
                <span class="tei_signed">W.D. O'Connor.</span>
