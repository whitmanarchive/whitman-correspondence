            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I see in the papers, with agitation and alarm, the reports about your illness, which,
                however, are so vague that I can hope they are exaggerations, and that you are no
                worse than when you sent me the postal card of the 18th of May.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> You were bad enough then, God knows, and I felt downcast
                at your condition, though trusting that it was no more than an ill turn, which would
                pass. I would have written to you earlier, but have had several hideous days myself,
                and been unfit to write.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">One paper speaks of Mr. Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">2</a> as being with you. I hope this is
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Doctor</span> Bucke, and that he may have come down to you from
                    Canada.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a></p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wait anxiously to hear how you are. If I were not so badly
                crippled—especially the last few days—I would try to come and hear for
                myself. But I should be in the way, considering my condition.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If Doctor Bucke is with you, I hope he will pencil me a word, if he can.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
