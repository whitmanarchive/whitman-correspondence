            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter came Saturday, with the acc't of the accident 
                &amp; sudden death of little Andrew—poor little child—I believe I have never seen him—it was sad enough—but the poor young one 
                is out of this world of sin &amp; trouble—&amp; I don't know as we 
                have any cause to mourn for him—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, my leave of absence will commence early next week, 
                but I will send you word two or three days before-hand, when I shall come on. 
                I have a good long leave, &amp; want to rest myself as much as possible, 
                &amp; have a change of scene, &amp; a quiet time, &amp; no literary or other work to bother me—only just have a good quiet moderate time, for somehow I feel as if 
                I wanted to throw off everything like work or thought, for a while—&amp; be with my old mammy at least a good part of the time—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mr. Evarts is still away—O'Connor was to move to-day, but it is showery, 
                &amp; he has postponed it till Wednesday—I was up there last evening, 
                &amp; had tea &amp; spent the evening.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote to Han Saturday last, &amp; enclosed your letter in mine—I am still at Mrs. Benedict's 472 M st.—find it about as good as 
                I could probably get anywhere—most of the boarders have left—I and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">another young man</span> are the only ones left—they were in the Departments, 
                &amp; were discharged—Many have been discharged within the last two months, 
                &amp; many more the end of this month are expected to be. 
                It makes great misery among some, especially with families—O'Connor &amp; Burroughs still retain their places—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, Mother, the summer is pretty well over—they say the folks 
                are coming home from the country, &amp;c—I am glad I didn't take my leave 
                1st of August, as I expected to, at one time—but was disappointed—When you get this I wish you to write one more letter—but no more till you see me—I think it is going to be a fine day—I am feeling well—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Well, I have a long job of copying to do for Ashton, so I will wind up my letter, 
                &amp; set about it—I shall write once more before I come—Good bye for this time, dear Mother.
            </p>
