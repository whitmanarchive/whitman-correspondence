            <p class="tei_p">Greeting, my dear Poet, for your 71<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span> birthday—now so close at hand,—greeting 
                &amp; all good wishes! These wishes have a new force to-day, when we watch your 
                ship of fate end yet another year's voyage—after storms &amp; many troubles of 
                wind &amp; weather. I trust the new year's voyage will at least be less painful,—free 
                from such vexations as that of my Lady, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">La Grippe</span>, who, 
                like the rest of us, seems to have become only too fond of you.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 11th inst<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—with slips 
                enc<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span>—— reached me last evening, only just in time! for the passage 
                oversea seems to have taken 12 days instead of 10. On first opening your letter I 
                did not realise that next morning was the 24<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>, &amp; went off unconcernedly enough to
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03343.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03343.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03343.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.03343.002.jpg</span>
            a little gathering of some friends of mine, (who call themselves the 'Rhymesters' Club'), 
            which took place in the garden of the old 'Spaniards' Inn near here—on Hampstead 
            Heath. There, after we had regaled in a green arbour, just as twilight stole down upon the 
            groups of trees &amp; the green fields below us, I drew out your 'Twilight Song', telling 
            the fellows you had just sent it, &amp; read it to them,—to their profound delight 
            (though I'm afraid I read it badly enough).</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Later when I got back here to my rooms, &amp; read your reference to the slips again, 
                I realised that if they were to be in any editors' hands in time for to-day's papers 
                they must be despatched somehow at once! This led to a notable night-excursion from these 
                heights of Hampstead down to Fleet-street, where I arrived something after midnight, going part 
                of the way by train—to Camden Town Sta. (for we have a Camden too), part by train or horse-car. 
                Though so late, when I passed the portico of the

            Covent Garden Opera-house, the carriages were still in full-swing— at nearly half-past 
            Twelve. There must have been an unusually long performance;—Wagner's 'Lohengrin' had been 
            given! Returning <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">via</span> Drury Lane—a choice place for scenes 
                in the Cockney comedy &amp; tragedy!—the struggles &amp; awful oaths of a madly 
                drunken women in a dark passage formed a little picture dreadful in the extreme, &amp; 
                yet very dramatic. In Oxford street then, feeling tired, I took a cab ('hansom,' with 
                capital driver &amp; fast horse) for a couple of miles or so; &amp; after that climbed the 
                hill to Hampstead cheerfully enough under the stars—for it was an almost perfect 
                May night. The clock struck Two—as I heard through the trees that surround this 
                place—just as I got into bed; &amp; so ended a memorable jaunt. Thus, you see, 
                that verse to the Queen has something of a history after its arrival in London.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The only paper which seems to have put the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">par</span>. in is the 
                'Pall Mall Gazette,' which put on its posters very conspicuously—'the Queen's 
                Birthday: Verses by Walt Whitman!' so that one saw it at every street-corner &amp; 
                news-stall. I suppose your name was never so extenseivly paraded in the outside public 
                of London before! This well makes up for the unaccountable remissness of the morning 
                papers—whose chief editors have in some cases gone away for Whitsuntide holidays, 
                I imagine, &amp; left careless subs. in their place! I send copy of 'P.M.G.' &amp; also

                very curtailed form, from the Gazette of a few days earlier. I must get the 'Budget' 
                to put you in its portrait-gallery on front page, one of these days.—</p>

                 as ever.—I hope you will have weather as good as we have been having this May
