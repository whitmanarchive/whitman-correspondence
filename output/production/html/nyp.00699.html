            <p class="tei_p">I send you Dr Bucke's letter from Florida just rec'd with the latest from our dear
                friend O'Connor (tho' I think Dr B's view is ab't as severe &amp; dark as the case
                will stand)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing very new or special with me—I am jogging along much the
                same—down hill no doubt even if slowly—this is the most nipping winter I
                have ever had—at present am sitting here by the fire in my little front
                room—have had my late breakfast (I rise late these cold days) of chocolate
                &amp; buckwheat cakes with quince jelly—feel so-so fair—Ernest Rhys is here—was 
                here last evn'g—his lecture, debate ab't, &amp; advocacy of, L of G. last Tuesday evn'g in N Y. seems to have been quite an
                affair—a success—the leaning of the full dress audience (many ladies)
                was palpably certainly on our side—quite remarkable—Tho' little Fawcett
                &amp; Rev. Lloyd had their say against L of G. Rhys delivers lecture again here in
                Phila. next Tuesday evn'g. I still have little bits in NY Herald—</p>
