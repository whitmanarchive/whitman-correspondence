            <p class="tei_p">Am feeling this deadly lassitude and weakness to-day the same still. 
                One favorable item at 10, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bowel movement</span> (the first in ten days), 
                viscid quite definite mostly formed, brown, no g't straining (no use of the syringe).

                our woes (and seems come to stay). I got the pills soon after 1 
                yesterday afternoon and took one—then near 5 another—then at 
                9 this morning another. Had a tolerable night. A rare egg on Graham toast 
                for breakfast—coffee; have been moist—skin 
                half sweating the last 15 or 20 hours. Am sitting here in the big chair in my den as usual.
