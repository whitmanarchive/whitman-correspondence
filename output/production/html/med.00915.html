            <p class="tei_p">Am feeling this deadly lassitude and weakness to-day the same still. 
                One favorable item at 10, a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">bowel movement</span> (the first in ten days), 
                viscid quite definite mostly formed, brown, no g't straining (no use of the syringe). 
                If this is the result of the new pills they are very welcome for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that 
                obstinate</span> deep-set-in constipation is the back and bottom of all 
                our woes (and seems come to stay). I got the pills soon after 1 
                yesterday afternoon and took one—then near 5 another—then at 
                9 this morning another. Had a tolerable night. A rare egg on Graham toast 
                for breakfast—coffee; have been moist—skin 
                half sweating the last 15 or 20 hours. Am sitting here in the big chair in my den as usual.
