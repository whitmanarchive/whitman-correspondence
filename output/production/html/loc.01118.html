                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am writing to you on the spur of the moment in hopes it will help bring me to my senses, for I am quite stunned at 
                the first glance of London. I have just come from St <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pauls​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Paul's​
        
      </span></span> &amp; feel 
                very strange. I don't know what is the matter with me but I seem in a dream. St <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pauls​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Paul's​
        
      </span></span> 
                was too much for me &amp; my brain actually reels. I have never seen 
                architecture before. It made me drunk I have seen a building with a living soul, I can't tell you about it 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01118.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01118.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01118.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                now. I saw for the first time what power &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I felt for a moment 
                what great genius was in this field. But I had to retreat after sitting down a half hour and trying to absorb it. I feel 
                as if I should go no where else while in London. I must master it or it will kill me. I actually grew faint. I was not 
                prepared for it &amp; I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">though​ </span><span class="tei_corr">thought​
        
      </span></span> my companions the Treasury clerks would 
                drive me mad they rushed round so, I had to leave them &amp; sit down. Hereafter I must go alone everywhere. My brain is 
                too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these things all at once. I would give anything 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01118.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01118.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01118.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> 
                if you was here. I see now that you belong here—these things are akin to your spirit. You would see your own in 
                St <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pauls​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Paul's​
        
      </span></span>, but it took my breath away. It was more than I could bear &amp; 
                I will have to gird up my loins &amp; try it many times. Out side it has the beauty &amp; 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">grandure​ </span><span class="tei_corr">grandeur​
        
      </span></span> of rocks and crags and 
                ledges. It is nature &amp; art fused into one. Of course time has done much for it, it is so stained and weather worn. It 
                is like a Rembrandt picture so strong &amp; deep is the light &amp; shade. It is more to 
                see the old world than I had dreamed, much more. I thought art was of little account, but now I get a glimpse of 
                the real article I am overwhelmed. I had

                designed to go on the continent, but I shall not stir out of London till I have vanquished some part of it at least. If 
                I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">loose​ </span><span class="tei_corr">lose​
        
      </span></span> my wits here why go further? But I shall make a brave fight. I only 
                wish I had help. These fellows are like monkeys. I have seen no one yet but shall try to find Conway 
                to morrow. I write you this dear Walt to help recover my self. I know it contains nothing you might expect to hear from me 
                in London, but I have got into Niagara without knowing it &amp; you must bear with me. I will give facts &amp; details next 
                time. Go &amp; see Ursula.</p>

            </span>
            
                <p class="tei_p">Oct 4—I went to day to see Conway but he was not in—so I went back to St <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pauls​ </span><span class="tei_corr">Paul's​
        
      </span></span> 
                    to see if I really made a fool of myself yesterday. I did not feel as before &amp; perhaps never shall again, yet it is 
                    truly grand &amp; there is no mistake. It is like the grandest organ music put into form</p>                                
                <p class="tei_p">P. S. I hope you &amp; O'Connor will really make an effort to come over here. You need not
                    mention it but I know it is not settled at all who will come. This you can rely upon, but there will be no more
                    bonds sent till in November.</p>
