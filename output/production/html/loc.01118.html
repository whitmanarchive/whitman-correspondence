            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am writing to you on the spur of the moment in hopes it will help bring me to my senses, for I am quite stunned at 
                the first glance of London. I have just come from St <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pauls​ </span></span> &amp; feel 
                very strange. I don't know what is the matter with me but I seem in a dream. St <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Pauls​ </span></span> 
                was too much for me &amp; my brain actually reels. I have never seen 
                architecture before. It made me drunk I have seen a building with a living soul, I can't tell you about it 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01118.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01118.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01118.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01118.002_large.jpg</span> 
                now. I saw for the first time what power &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I felt for a moment 
                what great genius was in this field. But I had to retreat after sitting down a half hour and trying to absorb it. I feel 
                as if I should go no where else while in London. I must master it or it will kill me. I actually grew faint. I was not 
                prepared for it &amp; I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">though​ </span></span> my companions the Treasury clerks would 
                drive me mad they rushed round so, I had to leave them &amp; sit down. Hereafter I must go alone everywhere. My brain is 
                too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these things all at once. I would give anything

                I will have to gird up my loins &amp; try it many times. Out side it has the beauty &amp; 
                <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">grandure​ </span></span> of rocks and crags and 
                ledges. It is nature &amp; art fused into one. Of course time has done much for it, it is so stained and weather worn. It 
                is like a Rembrandt<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> picture so strong &amp; deep is the light &amp; shade. It is more to 
                see the old world than I had dreamed, much more. I thought art was of little account, but now I get a glimpse of 
                the real article I am overwhelmed. I had

                I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">loose​ </span></span> my wits here why go further? But I shall make a brave fight. I only 
                wish I had help. These fellows are like monkeys. I have seen no one yet but shall try to find Conway<a href="#n0170" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0170">2</a> 
                to morrow. I write you this dear Walt to help recover my self. I know it contains nothing you might expect to hear from me 
                in London, but I have got into Niagara without knowing it &amp; you must bear with me. I will give facts &amp; details next

                    to see if I really made a fool of myself yesterday. I did not feel as before &amp; perhaps never shall again, yet it is

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and

                    married John Burroughs in 1857 and became a friend to Walt Whitman, a frequent
                    guest in the Burroughs household. When issues of sexual incompatibility arose in
                    the Burroughs marriage, Whitman sided with Ursula against John's sexual
                    "wantonness" and eventual infidelity. While John Burroughs traveled a great deal
                    due to his job as a bank examiner, Ursula and Whitman visited frequently, with
                    Ursula visiting the poet after his stroke in 1873. For more on Whitman's
