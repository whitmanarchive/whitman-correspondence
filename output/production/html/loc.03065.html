                out for the Tribune. I have sent (last Saturday) an elaborate vivisection of the Boston postmaster and Oliver Stevens together, which, if the Tribune, publishes, will certainly make a big row. I think you will like it as well as my first letter. It is gay and stinging until near the close, when it rises and darkens into righteous anger. The

                Boston journals will surely respond to it, and Tobey will rue the day. Old orthodox rascal!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Glad to hear your other book is near the launch. I got the programme—very attractive and picturesque. I only regretted that you had included your paper on Poe, which I think all mistaken. Every one flings a stone at poor Edgar—Stedman's, the worst of all.

                No such man as you fancy ever got and held the love of such a woman as Helen Whitman. I know so much about him through her, and through much reading of what he wrote, that I cannot help deploring all adverse criticism upon him.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Frothingham's article is fair, but unworthy of him. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">arriere pensee</span> is evident. He thinks better of your book than he dares
