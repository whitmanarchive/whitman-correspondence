                    over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
                    businesses in 1881–82. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> after opposition from the Boston
                    District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the original publisher,
                    to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days &amp;

                    Whitman's two recently published books, it seems logical to assign it to 1889
                    [for further clarification of the assigned date, see the second note below].
                    According to Edwin Haviland Miller's tabulation, based upon his letters and his
                    entries in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Commonplace-Book</span>, the poet's income in
                    1889 amounted to at least $1,447.91: royalties, $626.47; sales of books,
                    $245.89; payments for articles and poems, $95.00; and gifts,
                    $480.55. (The figures on book sales are necessarily to some extent
                    conjectural, based on the assumption that he charged uniform prices for his
                    various books.) The entries in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Commonplace-Book</span> in
                    1889, like those in 1888, are not complete, as discrepancies between amounts
                    deposited in the bank and notations of receipts of money are commonplace (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Commonplace-Book</span>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                    the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                    D.C.). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07743_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07743_n2"><span>Whitman is requesting a copy
                    of one of McKay's printings of the sixth (1881) edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, with the "annex" "Sands at Seventy." Because this
                    letter is undated, it could be argued that the poet was asking for the 1884
                    issue of the 1881 edition (the first issue published by McKay). However, he is
                    more likely asking for the 1888 issue, which dates the letter closer to 1889.
                    The postscript reference to the "pocket-b'k copy" Whitman gave to McKay with the
                    letter makes the year certain and eliminates the months January through May. The
                    poet had the special pocket-book edition printed in honor of his 70th birthday,
                    on May 31, 1889. See Whitman's <a href="loc.03392">May 16 1889</a> letter
                    to Frederick Oldach. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00869_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00869_n3"><span>Whitman had a limited

                    Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman signed the title
                    page of each one. The volume also included the annex <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sands at
