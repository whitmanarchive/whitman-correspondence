            <p class="tei_p">You see I am now back in my own country.<a href="#n1027" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1027">1</a> I had no idea that I
                would be so soon. I am staying, with my wife (I have been married about 18 months)
                at my father's house. We shall be here for some months now. There is great
                excitement in the country, but I think no likelihood of any serious disturbances.
                The people know the strength of England too well. I think the Land League<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">2</a> is slowly losing its influence here, and it deserves to.
                There never was an agitation conducted towards a more useful end or by worse means
                than this. From the very beginning the leaders of the people encouraged them to
                maintain <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.00988_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.00988_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.00988_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.00988_large.jpg</span> their
                organization by secret outrage and personal intimidation. There is not the slightest
                doubt that this was so. Their words may not have been arraignable by law, (though in
                many cases they were so) but they were such as their hearers could give but one
                interpretation to. "If a man takes a farm from which another has been evicted" says
                Mr. Dillon, "I don't think his cattle will prosper very much."<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> And they don't, for in hundreds of cases these cattle
                have had wooden balls struck over with nails administered to them, have been driven
                over precipices, hamstrung, their eyes picked out. There is little violence just
                now, because the Land League is so all-powerful, and murder or violence is so
                certain to follow a breach of its rules, that no one ventures to transgress them.
                The speakers have in general terms condemned assassination in the sort of language
                which one would use to reprove excessive zeal, but they have never interfered <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.00989_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_af.00989_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_af.00989_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_af.00989_large.jpg</span> by word or deed
                to prevent any individual crime which was known to be intended, or condemned with
                energy any individual murder. There are 150 persons now whose lives would not be
                safe for one hour but for police protection, and no Land Leaguer will say one word
                to save them. I entirely agree with them in thinking that it is allowable of the
                tenants to repudiate unjust rents, and I would have thrown myself heart and soul
                into this movement if it were not founded upon crime of the most degrading and
                brutal kind. But as it is, I must say I think the Government are quite justified in
                bringing in their Protection Bill,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> &amp; the League has
                itself to blame for making that Bill necessary. I think too that once it receives a
                straight and severe blow its tyranny will be utterly broken, for it has largely
                ruled by terror and I do not believe that it has endeared itself to the people.</p>

                    frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
                    book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection

                    movement, organized in 1879 by Michael Davitt and led by Charles Parnell, the
                    Land League agitated for land tenure reform and for the transferal of land
                    ownership from British landholders to Irish tenants. The fight for fixity of
                    tenure, fair rent, and free sale was accompanied by boycotting and violence,
                    until the League was declared illegal. However, the group did carry the land
                    question into the realm of practical politics and was an active force in
                    bringing about the great land reform bills which culminated in the Land Purchase
                    Act of 1903. See Michael Davitt, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fall of Feudalism in

                    Land League discovered its most powerful weapon of attack—the boycott. The
                    phrase Rolleston quotes here is commonly associated with a September 1880 speech
                    by Land League President Charles Stewart Parnell (see, for instance, James M.
                    Jasper, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Art of Moral Protest</span> [Chicago: University of
                    Chicago Press, 2008], 251–252), but Norman D. Palmer writes: "Apparently
                    the subject was first referred to during the land campaign by John Dillon, who,
                    speaking at Maryborough, Queen's County, on October 5, 1879, advised that if a
                    tenant took a farm from which another had been evicted, no man should 'speak to
                    him or have any business transaction with him.' And Dillon's words were repeated
                    and elaborated on numerous occasions prior to September, 1880, by other
                    spokesmen of the league" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Irish Land League Crisis</span>
                    [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1940], 196). John Dillon (1851–1927),
                    an Irish nationalist politician, was a very active member of the Land League and
                    advocated a fighting policy for the organization. His tempestuous
                    career—he was arrested several times and traveled extensively in his
                    campaigns, even to America and Australia—was spent participating in
                    various Irish nationalist groups: the Land League, the Irish National
                    Federation, and the Nationalist Party. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.05077_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_frenz tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.05077_n4"><span>The Protection of Life and

                    "Morey letter," a document allegedly written by James A. Garfield that surfaced
                    during the 1880 election. It was first called "Garfield's Death Warrant" because
                    the letter's author advocated extended Chinese immigration. Garfield denied
                    authorship and, since in 1879 Garfield had opposed a Chinese exclusion law, his
                    position on the subject was known, and the piece was quickly believed to be a
                    forgery (John I. Davenport, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of the Forged "Morey

                    does indicate the contemporary disturbance over Chinese immigration. In 1880, a
                    treaty was signed providing for regulation or suspension of immigration but not
                    its absolute prohibition, and two years later, in 1882, the Chinese Exclusion
                    Act was passed. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.05077_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_frenz tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.05077_n5"><span>See the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Academy</span> 18 (1880), 238: "Walt Whitman will shortly give in one of the
