            <p class="tei_p">It gets very tedious here—(I have now been in my room and bed five
                weeks)—I am sitting up in a rocker and get along better than you would
                think—I think upon the whole I am getting mending—slowly and faintly
                enough yet sort o' perceptibly—the trouble is sore and broken brain—the
                old nag gives out and it hurts to even go or draw at all—but there are some
                signs the last two days that slight ambles will justify themselves—even for
                old habit, if nothing else—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">It was probably the sixth or seventh whack of my war paralysis, and a pretty severe
                one—the doctors looked glum—Bucke I think saved my
                life as he happened to be here—Shimmering, fluctuating since, probably
                gathering, recruiting, but as I now write I shall rally or partially
                rally—only every time lets me down a peg—I hear from you by Horace
                Traubel—I have an idea
                that O'Connor is a little better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A rainy evening here, not at all hot, quiet—</p>
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1888-07-31">Friday July 13</span>—Just after noon—Ab't the same. I am sitting up, had a fair
                night—rose late, have eaten my breakfast—have rec'd a good letter from
                O'C—nothing very special or new—fine, clear, cool. Today my head <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">thicks</span> somewhat today. Love to you, dear friend. Love and
                remembrance to 'Sula, to July, too.
                I am on to 90th page Nov. Boughs—it will only make
                20 more.</p>
