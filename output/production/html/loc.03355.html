                    one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
                    via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
                    of <a href="loc.04038">March 18, 1879</a>). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
                    expressed "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">worry</span>...[that] <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> is...<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">too personal</span>, too emotional,
                    launched from the fires of...spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the

                        1882</a>). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
                    Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
                    of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie
