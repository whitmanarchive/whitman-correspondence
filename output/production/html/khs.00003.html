                    (1830–1901) was born in London and came to the U.S. in 1851. He trained as
                    a printer, and, like the radical abolitionist writer and publisher James
                    Redpath, went to Kansas and joined John Brown. In fact, but for an accident he
                    would have been with Brown at Harper's Ferry. A man mistaken for Hinton was
                    hanged. Together with Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Hinton also planned the
                    jailbreak of John Brown's accomplices Albert Hazlett and Aaron Stevens in
                    Charlestown for the "Jayhawkers," a band of abolitionists who assisted slaves
                    through the Underground Railroad that included Silas S. Soule. With James
                    Redpath he was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hand-book to Kansas Territory and
                        the Rocky Mountains' Gold Region</span> (New York: J. H. Colton, 1859). Later
                    he wrote <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rebel Invasion of Missouri and Kansas</span> (Chicago:
                    Church &amp; Goodman, 1865) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Brown and His Men</span>
                    (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, 1894). Apparently Hinton had suggested
                    that Thayer &amp; Eldridge print <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> (see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The New Voice</span>, 16 [4 February 1899], 2). Hinton served in
                    the Union Army from 1861 to 1865, and saw Whitman while lying wounded in a
                    hospital, a scene which he described in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cincinnati Commercial</span> on August 26, 1871. After the war Hinton wrote for many
                    newspapers. He defended William O'Connor's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Good Gray
                        Poet</span> in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Milwaukee Sentinel</span> on February 9,
                    1866 (2). Hinton's article in the Rochester <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Evening Express</span>
                    on March 7, 1866, "Farms and Fortunes in England and America," included a
                    lengthy discussion of Whitman, with quotations from O'Connor and John Burroughs.
                    Obviously pleased, Whitman sent it to friends, including William Michael
                    Rossetti, who acknowledged it on <a href="loc.01879">April 12, 1868</a>
