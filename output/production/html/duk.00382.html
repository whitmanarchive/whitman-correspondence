               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter this morning—I hope you have had as pleasant a change in the weather, as we have here—it rained yesterday &amp; the night before—&amp; to-day the weather is just right—cool enough—poor old Mrs. Mix is quite sick—Hector Tyndale has been to see me again—always talks about you—When in the army he had a very bad wound in the head—was a year getting over it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I think George must mind how he exposes himself to the sun, or gets overheated—I find I have to maneuvre through the very hot days, like a general in fight—I carry an umbrella, and if the sun gets to fall on me good &amp; strong, any of the real hot days, my head gets swimming, &amp; I have to stop in the street, or rather get inside some store or something, &amp; sit down—I have had just that happen to me twenty times—so now I am very slow &amp; careful—I think George might find a suit of good blue navy flannel first-rate for the hot weather—I am wearing mine—the suit I wore last summer—I never had any thing for heat that suited me so well—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff, I hope you had, (or will have,) a first rate time on your fishing excursion—I should like greatly to be with you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well good bye for this time, dear mother—I send you some envelopes. Love to sister Mat, &amp; the little girls.
