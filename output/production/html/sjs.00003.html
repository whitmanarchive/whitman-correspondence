                up" on his condition—eyes better at intervals but bad enough yet—Dr
                Bucke is here very busy with the water-meter business &amp; starting it
                practically—all going fairly considering—Dr B expects to go to
                W[ashingto]n briefly—Not well with me, a bad trouble of spleen malady it
                seems—The little German translation is out—Shall I send you one?</p>
