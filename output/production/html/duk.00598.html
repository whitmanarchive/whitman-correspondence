    <hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n8">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00598_n8 note" id="duk.00598_n8"><span>The most probable date for
                    this letter is July 14, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1870,
                    but Edwin Haviland Miller dated it to 1869 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:367). Bucke's reason for dating the letter to 1870 is unclear, but Walt
                    Whitman returned to Brooklyn for his vacation in July 1870. It is unlikely, were
                    the letter to date 1870, that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman would omit mention of
                    Walt's expected arrival within less than two weeks. Miller's year 1869 is
                    believed correct, and numerous factors support this date, though most are
                    indirect. The letter states that granddaughter Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman is
                    "only [9?] years old." Though the number is at best semi-legible, Hattie was 9
                    years old in July 1869. Another indirect reason to prefer the year 1869 is Helen
                    Price's statement that her mother Abby Price has written to Walt and hopes that
                    he will respond. Walt wrote Abby Price on <a href="pml.00029">July 16,
                        1869</a> to thank Helen for visiting his mother, prompted perhaps by this
                    letter or by Abby Price's. Louisa had anticipated a visit by the Prices earlier
                    in July (see her <a href="tex.00170">July 5–12?, 1869</a> letter to
                    Walt). Miller proposed that Walt's letter to Abby Price was prompted by this
                    letter, but Walt did not respond to news about Emily "Emma" Price's marriage
                        (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 2:83, n. 31), which is an odd
                    complication. Emily Price married Edward M. Law, an engraver, in 1869. Louisa
                    writes of the expected date of marriage only that she "beleive[s] they think," a
                    phrase that suggests uncertainty. That is a peculiar statement in July 1869
                    because Emily Price—according to another letter—married in late
                    April or early May 1869. Just after a visit by Helen Price (Emily's sister),
                    Louisa wrote to Walt that Emily "married about two or three weeks ago" (see
                    Louisa's <a href="tex.00171">May 30, 1869</a> letter to Walt). That letter
                    of course conflicts with this letter's month July: the date of Emily Price's
                    marriage is an awkward complication, which may suggest confusion on Louisa's
                    part or an effort by the Prices to be ambiguous about Emily's marriage
                    date—or that this letter is not dated correctly. Despite that
                    complication, many factors support summer 1869 for this letter. The width of the
                    paper in this letter is consistent with Louisa's <a href="tex.00170">July
                        5–12?, 1869</a> letter to Walt, which does mention the expected
                    visit by the Prices. On the basis of the Price visit, Emily Price's marriage,
                    granddaughter Hattie's age, and Walt's <a href="pml.00029">July 16,
                        1869</a> letter to Abby Price, this letters most likely dates to July 14,
                    1869. </span></span> [<a href="#r8">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    family, especially her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt and Louisa Van

                    (1814–1878) business involved the attachment of ruffles, a process for
                    which her partner, the inventor George B. Arnold, had developed a sewing machine
                    attachment (see Sherry L. Ceniza, "Walt Whitman and Abby Price," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</span> 7:2 [Fall 1989],
                    50–51, 63, n. 7). Abby Price had offered Walt $1000 to lobby Thomas
                    Harland, the chief clerk in the Patent Office, to have her ruffles exempted from
                    the list of articles subject to a tax assessment because the materials used to
                    make the ruffles were already taxed (see Abby Price's <a href="yal.00378">March 25, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman). Also see Ceniza, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</span>

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
