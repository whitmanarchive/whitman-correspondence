                    Whitman's correspondence with Richard Maurice Bucke at this time is lost, for it
                    would presumably reveal that after the poet informed Bucke of Osgood's decision
                    on April 19, the latter suggested that O'Connor be enlisted to reply to the
                    charges of obscenity. Since the poet and O'Connor had been estranged for ten
                    years, Bucke undoubtedly wrote to O'Connor to obtain his consent. Probably
                    Whitman discussed the matter frankly in a "long letter" to Bucke on April 27
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
                    Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). At any
                    rate their correspondence resumed without mention of their misunderstanding.
                    Jottings in Whitman's Commonplace Book suggest that Whitman had attempted to
                    heal the wounds for many years. He sent to O'Connor the following books and
                    articles: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During the War</span> in April, 1876; the
                    Centennial Edition in March, 1879; his Emerson article in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Literary World</span> in May, 1880; "Poetry of the Future" in December, 1880;

                    August 4, 1881; and the Osgood edition on December 25, 1881. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
