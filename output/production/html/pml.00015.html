               <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,
               </span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just received your letter, &amp; respond immediately, because by what you have written, it may be that you can do me a great favor—I have obtained leave of absence, &amp; am coming to New York, principally to bring out a new &amp; much better edition of Leaves of Grass complete—that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">unkillable</span> work!—Mother's apartments in Pacific st are very limited, &amp; I had decided to get a lodging room in N. Y. or Brooklyn, so as not to incommode my folks at home—taking my meals at the restaurants, &amp; home &amp;c—leaving my time free for my work &amp;c—Now <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have you such a room for me</span>, at a fair price? I hope you have, for that would be very agreeable—Your going off for a week or two would not make any difference—as a lodging is my main object—write <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediately</span> &amp; let me know, as my leave of absence will probably date from Monday next, 6th inst—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mrs. O'Connor has gone west, with her mother, for the summer—Wm O'Connor is well—We all speak of you—The weather is almost perfect here now-a-days—I am writing this by my window in the south front of the Treasury building, looking down the beautiful grounds in front, and across &amp; down the Potomac for miles, &amp; across to the green hills all along Arlington Heights, very beautiful &amp; cool—a view of great expanse, &amp; very comforting every way—also a pleasant breeze coming in steadily from the river.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have an agreeable situation here—labor moderate—&amp; plenty of leisure—My principal work is to make (from rough drafts) the letters, answers, law opinions, &amp;c that go from the Attorney General to the President, or to the Secretary of State, &amp; the other Heads of Departments—The rule is that none but such officers as just named have a right to require information from Attorney Generals—So you see I have to do only with the big men—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is one regular Soldiers Hospital left here, in K street—I go there once or twice every week—it is still a great privilege to go—You would be amazed, as well as distressed, to know how many old wounds are lingering along yet—youth &amp; hope struggling against fate—but the latter, alas! almost always conquering at last—it is indeed a great privilege to soothe the lingering days &amp; months of many of these cases.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Mother is quite well, &amp; comfortable—considering her age—brothers, sisters &amp; the children, all well, at last accounts.</p>
