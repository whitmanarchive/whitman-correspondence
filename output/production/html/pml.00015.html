            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just received your letter, &amp; respond immediately, because by what you have written, it may be that you can do me a great favor—I have obtained leave of absence, &amp; am coming to New York, principally to bring out a new &amp; much better edition of Leaves of Grass complete—that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">unkillable</span> work!—Mother's apartments in Pacific st are very limited, &amp; I had decided to get a lodging room in N. Y. or Brooklyn, so as not to incommode my folks at home—taking my meals at the restaurants, &amp; home &amp;c—leaving my time free for my work &amp;c—Now <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have you such a room for me</span>, at a fair price? I hope you have, for that would be very agreeable—Your going off for a week or two would not make any difference—as a lodging is my main object—write <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediately</span> &amp; let me know, as my leave of absence will probably date from Monday next, 6th inst—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mrs. O'Connor<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a> has gone west, with her mother, for the summer—Wm O'Connor<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> is well—We all speak of you—The weather is almost perfect here now-a-days—I am writing this by my window in the south front of the Treasury building, looking down the beautiful grounds in front, and across &amp; down the Potomac for miles, &amp; across to the green hills all along Arlington Heights, very beautiful &amp; cool—a view of great expanse, &amp; very comforting every way—also a pleasant breeze coming in steadily from the river.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have an agreeable situation here—labor moderate—&amp; plenty of leisure—My principal work is to make (from rough drafts) the letters, answers, law opinions, &amp;c that go from the Attorney General to the President, or to the Secretary of State, &amp; the other Heads of Departments—The rule is that none but such officers as just named have a right to require information from Attorney Generals—So you see I have to do only with the big men—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">There is one regular Soldiers Hospital left here, in K street—I go there once or twice every week—it is still a great privilege to go—You would be amazed, as well as distressed, to know how many old wounds are lingering along yet—youth &amp; hope struggling against fate—but the latter, alas! almost always conquering at last—it is indeed a great privilege to soothe the lingering days &amp; months of many of these cases.</p>

                    (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
                    husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
                    children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
                    age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter, Helen,
                    were friends with Whitman and with Whitman's mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
                    In 1860 the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
                    Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for
                    the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Putnam's Monthly</span> 5 (1908): 163–169. In a letter to Ellen M.
                    O'Connor from <a href="nyp.00185">November 15, 1863</a>, Whitman declared
                    with emphasis, "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">they are all friends</span>, to prize &amp; love
                    deeply." For more information on Whitman and Abby H.

                    with William D. and Ellen "Nelly" M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and
                    later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
                    Washington years. Ellen O'Connor had a close personal relationship with Whitman.
                    In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
                    Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
                    Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
                    correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
                    correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
                    O'Connors see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00015_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00015_n4"><span>William Douglas O'Connor
                    (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an
                    abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. He had been an
                    assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening Post</span> before he
                    went to Washington. O'Connor was an intelligent man who deserved something
                    better than the various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his
                    death. The humdrum of clerkship, however, was relieved by the presence of
                    Whitman whom he was to love and venerate—and defend with a single-minded
                    fanaticism and an outpouring of vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been
                    equaled, most notably in his pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first,
                    and in many ways the most important, of the adulators who divided people
                    arbitrarily into two categories: those who were for and those who were against
                    Walt Whitman. The poet praised O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous
                    collection of his tales: "He was a born sample here in the 19th century of the
                    flower and symbol of olden time first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his
                    memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton,
