                A pleasant day out &amp; I am feeling better than for two weeks 
                past—Drove down yesterday three or four miles to Gloucester, on the 
                Delaware below here, to a fine old public house close to the river, where I
                had four hours &amp; a good dinner of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">planked shad</span> &amp; champagne—had a 
                good view of the picturesque sight of the great boat, 20 black men rowing 
                rhythmically, paying out the big seine—making a circuit in the river, 
                (here quite a bay)—enjoyed all &amp; was driven back to Camden ab't 
                sundown—So you see I get out &amp; have fun yet—but it is a dwindling business—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                I enclose an old note from Kennedy. Mrs Louise C Moulton was here 
                day before yesterday—two English travelers a couple of hours later—Did 
                I acknowledge &amp; thank you for your good letter of a week ago?—Last 
                evn'g came a little eng: from one of J.F. Millet's pictures—a present from 
                Felix Adler of N Y—Best love &amp; remembrances to you both—
