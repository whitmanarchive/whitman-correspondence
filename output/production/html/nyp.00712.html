                A pleasant day out &amp; I am feeling better than for two weeks 
                past—Drove down yesterday three or four miles to Gloucester, on the 
                Delaware below here, to a fine old public house close to the river, where I
                had four hours &amp; a good dinner of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">planked shad</span> &amp; champagne<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—had a 
                good view of the picturesque sight of the great boat, 20 black men rowing 
                rhythmically, paying out the big seine—making a circuit in the river, 
                (here quite a bay)—enjoyed all &amp; was driven back to Camden ab't 
                sundown—So you see I get out &amp; have fun yet—but it is a dwindling business—</p>

                    (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
                    friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
                    beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
                    champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane

                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    the New York Society of Ethical Culture (1877) and the National Child Labor
                    Committee (1904). His philosophy sought to unite theists, atheists, agnostics,
                    and deists under the same moral social actions, and argued that morality should
                    be considered independently from religion. For more on Adler, see Horace Friess,

                    when Whitman told Adler that the poems in Leaves of Grass "are really only
