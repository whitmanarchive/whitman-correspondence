                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Mr. Rossetti,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of last summer to William O'Connor<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> with the passages transcribed from a lady's correspondence have been shown
                me by him, and a copy lately furnished me, which I have just been re-reading. I am
                deeply touched by these sympathies &amp; convictions coming from a woman, &amp; from
                England, &amp; am sure that if the lady knew how much comfort it has been to me to
                get them, she would not only pardon you for transmitting them to Mr. O'Connor, but
                approve that action.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> I realize indeed of such an
                emphatic &amp; smiling <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Well done</span> from the heart &amp;
                conscience of a true wife &amp; mother, &amp; one too whose sense of the poetic, as
                I glean from your letter, after flowing through the heart &amp; conscience, also
                comes through &amp; must satisfy Science, as much as the esthetic, that I had
                hitherto received no eulogium so magnificent.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I send by same mail with this, same address as this letter, two photographs, taken
                within a few months. One is intended for the lady (if I may be permitted to send it
                her)—and will you please accept the other with my respects &amp; love? The
                picture is by some criticized very severely indeed, but I hope you will not dislike
                it, for I confess myself to a (perhaps capricious) fondness for it as my own
                portrait over some scores that have been made or taken at one time or another.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still at work in the Attorney General's office. My p. o. address remains the
                same, here. I am, &amp; have been, quite well &amp; hearty. My new editions,
                considerably expanded, with what suggestions &amp;c. I have to offer, presented, I
                hope, in more definite, graphic form, will probably get printed, the coming spring.
                I shall forward you early copies.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I send my love to Moncure Conway,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> if you see him. I wish he would
                write to me, soon &amp; fully. If the pictures don't reach you, or if they get
                injured on the way, I will try again by express. I wish you to read or loan this
                letter to the lady—or, if she wishes it, give it to her to keep.</p>

                    sent on July 13, 1869, what O'Connor termed a "precious enclosure," extracts
                    from Anne Gilchrist's correspondence with the English critic. In his letter
                    Rossetti described Gilchrist: "The writer is a lady of earlyish middle age,
                    &amp; more than common literary cultivation. She is a person of remarkably
                    strong sense, firm perception, solidity of judgment, with a rather strong
                    scientific turn. My impression is that hitherto she has cared very little about
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">poetry</span>. …If I had been asked how this lady
                    would receive Whitman's poems, I should have replied—'She will glance into
                    them, set them aside in her own mind as eccentric unavailable sort of work,
                    &amp; never touch the book again.' And see how utterly I should have been
                    mistaken. The result fairly astonishes me" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
                    the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
                    D.C.). Writing to Rossetti on August 28, 1869, O'Connor was obviously deeply
                    moved, though he did not know "the dear lady's name," and he noted that, after
                    reading the extracts, Walt Whitman's "Olympian front was surcharged with a
                    tender pensiveness" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span> [New York: Charles
                    Scribner's Sons, 1903], 459–460). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00097_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00097_n2"><span>In his letter to
                    O'Connor, Rossetti said: "I have not told her that I communicate her letters to
                    any one" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). But in his diary on
                    July 23, 1869, he noted that he had informed Anne Gilchrist of his action (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons],
                    404). Gilchrist began to expand her comments in September, and on November 19,
                    1869, Rossetti "finished transcribing Mrs Gilchrist's paper on Whitman"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti Papers</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons,
                    1903], 411, 415, and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Letters of William Michael Rossetti</span>,

                    1934), 27–45. At the time Whitman wrote to Rossetti, he probably had
                    received the new version. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_upa.00097_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="upa.00097_n3"><span>Though Walt Whitman did
                    not realize that Anne Gilchrist's passion included his person as well as his
                    poetry, this letter, which Rossetti gave to her, served to inflame her ardor.
                    See her letter to Rossetti on January 1, 1870 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rossetti

                    that he had conveyed "your cordial message" to Conway, who had recently returned
                    from Russia. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
