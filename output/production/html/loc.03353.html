                    one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
                    via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
                    of <a href="loc.04038">March 18, 1879</a>). Ruskin, according to Whitman,

                        1882</a>). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my

                    of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With
