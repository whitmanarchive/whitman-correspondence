            <p class="tei_p"> It is a warm, foggy, dull, stupid half rainy day. I have been out for an hour's slow
                drive over the dirty roads for a mouthful of fresh air, have since had a cup of tea
                and a piece of dry toast and am now (630 P.M.) sitting at my desk in my office at
                the Asylum.</p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I have spent part of the day looking over L. of G. and I wish I could tell you, or
                convey to you in the faintest way, the deep down emotions that that book exites in
                me. There is nothing stirs me up like it. Sometimes as I read it I feel as if my
                whole previous life were rolling en masse through me <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00665.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_es.00665.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_es.00665.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> and as if at the same time vast vistas
                were opening ahead which I longed and yet half dreaded to enter. The profound
                religious sentiment which that book is destined to develope in the human heart when
                it becomes once assimilated by (incorporated into) the life of the race is, I think,
                simply inconceivable at present. But "The time <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">will</span> come
                though we stop here today and tonight."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Tomorrow I give my 7<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> lecture to the students—one
                more will end the course for this year.</p>
