                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
                    as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam

                    (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
                    for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
                    December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
                    Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
                    Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
                    some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00429">December 15, 1863</a> to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
                    institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her <a href="duk.00433">December 25, 1863</a> letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
                    him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
                    Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
                    (see E. Warner's <a href="loc.01972">March 22, 1870</a> letter to Walt).

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her
