            preparations to settle up affairs he couldent
            tell how matters would turn out)
            but george said he dident think lane

                from han
            so long so yesterday i sent a few
            lines to Heyde so i expect to get an account
            how or what i cant tell i hope it will be
            short but i thought to hear from him would
            be better than not hearing at all) two or three
            weeks ago edd was down town and encountered
                henry rome
            he talked a great deal about
            Jess
                said it was too damed bad to keep him
                there
            that he henry had broke out and got
            away he is evedently deranged i dident
            know but what he would induce Jess to
            leave and come with him but i dont know
            as they can get away very easy i dont know
            what i should doo if such should happen
                they must have much trouble with henry) smith
            told George he came running up the street
            the other day without hat or coat or shoes
            i thought walter dear maybee it would
            be better for you to write to the Doctor
            and see if he is as usual i dont put
            any faith in what he said but at first
            it made me feel bad i beleive he told
                eddy Jess wouldent come) i got a letter
            from matty she has not been so well but is
            gaining again she and the children talks some of
            going to minesota to stay the summer)
