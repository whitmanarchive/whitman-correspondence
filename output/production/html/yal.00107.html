                <span class="tei_salute">My dear friend,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you saw my letter to William O'Connor, a week since, with notice of my safe
                arrival home, &amp; account of one thing &amp; another up to that date. I have
                called at the American News Company store. They have not sold many of the
                Notes—not more than a hundred. It seems to be well-known, however, &amp; often
                talked about. I have procured &amp; given Henry Clapp
                
                a copy, at his particular request. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have seen F. P. Church, who treated me with great courtesy—he was anxious
                about the article on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Democracy</span>—wishes to have it for
                the December number—said he would publish the little piece <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Ethiopia Commenting</span>—but thought it best to keep it back till after the Democracy article
                had appeared.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have not done anything further to the latter-named piece—but shall try to
                have it ready in time for the December number. I think it likely I shall return last
                of this week to Washington. I have not received any letter at all from Washington.
                H. J. Raymond is home from Europe.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Give my best respects to Mrs. Burroughs—as I am coming back so soon, I will
                mention then what I have to say on the shirt question. I am living at 1194 Atlantic
                st. opposite Hamilton street. There is nothing specially new or important among my
                folks—they all wish me to give their best regards to you.</p>
