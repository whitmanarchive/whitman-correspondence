                <p class="tei_p"> Its a long time now since I've written to you, &amp; I owe you thanks for the
                    many papers, &amp;c. you have sent me, containing verse &amp; other matter connected
                    with you. I asked you the last time I wrote to let me have one small poem which
                    I felt especially stirred by, in your own handwriting. I don't think I've heard
                    from you since then. Will you remember this now, if
                    it doesn't trouble you too much? I don't possess a single line of your verse in
                    your own handwriting, &amp; I should think it a very <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">precious</span> possession. The
                    poem I meant is that on the Arctic snowbird.</p>
                <p class="tei_p"> I send you herewith a magazine of which <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03573.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03573.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03573.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> I have been made Editor. The
                    article signed 'H. Rowlandson' is mine. It (i.e. the Review) emanates from
                    Trinity College Dublin and aims at introducing Nationalist thought among the
                    upper classes in Ireland. We have to go forward very
                    cautiously in this enterprise, political questions here are so fiercely debated,
                    &amp; at present we can only reconcile the landed interest &amp; conservative
                    element by opening our columns to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">both</span> sides alike. To get Nationalists admitted
                    at all to an audience in Trinity College is a great step. We publish an article
                    by Michael Davitt in September. I have been getting
                    acquainted with him and other prominent members of the National party here since
                    I came back. The best man I have met in Ireland is John O'Leary, formerly editor of the 'Irish People', imprisoned in 1865
                    for Fenianism. He has been living in Paris ever since; let out after 5 years

                    condition of remaining abroad till his sentence (20 years) was out. This
                    expired in Jan/1885 &amp; he is to the fore again now. A grand looking old man—long
                    white beard, aquiline features, keen eyes—spare, sinewy frame, full of
                    restrained passion and energy.</p>
                <p class="tei_p"> What about Dr Knortz? I have heard nothing from him
                    at all about that translation of the L. of G. which he should have had revised &amp;
                    ready long ago. I think of writing to him about it. I fully expected it would have
                    appeared before May.</p>
                <p class="tei_p"> We have gone into a house of our own now, at least one we have rented for
                    several years, &amp; we are pretty well fixtures now. All of us well—especially
                    my two little boys, who enjoy the country life very much. We have a good garden
                    &amp; a little land which I work myself. On the whole, like this sort of
                         life very
                    much. We are about ¾ of an hour by train from Dublin, so have easy access to libraries, fr. there. </p>
                <p class="tei_p"> I hope you are well &amp; hearty. I am sorry to hear the sale of the L. of G. has
                    not been so good lately. Wish we had fairly opened it in Germany. Will you send
                    a line to Knortz? I was to give him 20 dollars for the work—am only
                    waiting to hear that it is complete to send it, but don't like sending 
                    till I know that he is going in for the thing, as I havn't yet even heard that
                    he had begun it.</p>
