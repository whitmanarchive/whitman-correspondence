            <p class="tei_p">I am so much occupied with the meter and a lot of other things including work on our 
                W. W. book that I can not write as often as I sh<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d</span> like—but you will 
                be far away wrong if you think there is any other reason
                for my comparative silence. But something has gone wrong with the Smiths and I may as well tell you first as last.

                at the Costelloes on Friday and gave Mrs C. your messages to her and the Smiths she never answered me and never asked
                a question about you. But do not let all this worry you, dear Walt,—there are a few of us left and we will
                be a legion when the right time comes. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">My</span> only feeling in the matter is one of intense curiousity.

                to Johnston <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00459.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_zs.00459.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_zs.00459.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> thanking J. for his "notes" and 
                in that letter he expressed himself
                as being very much your friend. Why should he write to J. that way if he had ceased to be your friend? J. is a stranger
                to Mr. S &amp; he had no temptation as far as I can see, to pretend anything to him. I have had some talk with H. B. Forman
                (I am writing from his home) on the subject. (F. is your friend through &amp; through) &amp; he thinks that
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Mrs S.</span> &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Mr</span> Costelloe 
                are responsible for the coolness—be this
                as it may the coolness itself is a solid fact. I have not so far accomplished anything in meter matters but the parties who
                are looking into it seem much interested—I may do something yet before I leave England or I may only pave the way for future business.
                Give my love to Horace and say to him that I will write him soon.—My trip is agreeing with me and I am as well and hearty
                as possible</p>
