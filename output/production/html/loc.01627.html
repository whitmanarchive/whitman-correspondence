                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Well, I am sitting here in the parlor again writing my weekly letter—as I write, the rain is pouring &amp; it is a thick &amp; dark day enough—I am feeling pretty bad, but it seems to be mostly from a severe cold in the head—anyhow I am having one of my bad spells, of which I have gone through so many—had a bad night last night—but have eat my breakfast this morning, &amp; have no doubt 
                I shall feel better before many days. Pete, I rec'd your letter &amp; the Herald 
                last Monday all right. Did Mr &amp; Mrs. Nash get the 3 Graphics I sent them?—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been out most every day the past week, &amp; been across the river to Philadelphia—it has been a very pleasant week, &amp; I have enjoyed sailing across the Delaware, 
                &amp; the splendid sunsets most every evening—it is my greatest enjoyment—</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01627.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01627.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01627.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete, all you write about folks &amp; things in Washington is interesting to me—it will be read, every thing you scratch down, as I sit here a great deal of the time, 
                (&amp; time is dull &amp; lonesome, at the best)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My pieces I have written (I believe I mentioned about it,) have not yet appeared 
                in the Magazine—but the money has been paid me for them, &amp; they are in type, &amp; I have read the proofs—I will either send them to you, when printed, or send you word, so you can get them yourself—Did I send you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">both</span> my letters about the Capitol in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Graphic</span>?—I believe I did, but if not I can yet—I send you to-day's <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil.</span>​  <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Press</span>—nothing special in it—Well, good bye for this time, dear loving boy,
            </p>

            </span>
            
             
                <p class="tei_p">Pete, how about running on here to see me for a day or two?—Couldn't you come, 
                    convenient, say latter part of next week? If you can, I will fix the time—</p>
