            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 22d has come &amp; is welcomed—That must have been a most 
                satisfactory affair at the church—no doubt it will all have to grow &amp; adjust &amp; form 
                itself—but my idea is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">it is a real thing</span> appropriate &amp; good 
                &amp; with money &amp; a healthy life action in it—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">a good plan
                    &amp; don't you abandon it</span>—Horace was here night before last for an hour or so—of 
                course we talk'd mostly ab't you—Seems to me you had better come back here, &amp; get good &amp; 
                ready &amp; radiate from here—Interior NY State &amp; Canada, are good areas to rummage next 
                summer—But of course you must judge &amp; decide for yourself—Harned's 
                hurt is not serious—he is out again I believe tho' I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">havn't​ </span><span class="tei_corr">haven't​

                seen him—Dr Bucke is still in Florida—will probably be here next 
                week—he enjoys F immensely—Rhys is east (Boston)—I get word 
                from Kennedy—Eakins' pict. is ab't finished—it 
                is over in Phila—it is a portrait work of power &amp; realism ("a poor old blind despised &amp; 
                dying King")—Things with me ab't the same—Mrs. D 
                is well—is in the back room working—my canary is singing away as I write. three little 
                boys have just been in to see me—my respects &amp; love to y'r mother 
                &amp; all—tell Henry I rec'd his card—no definite day set 
                for the Fidelity lect: I am waiting for the Hicks bust—</p>
