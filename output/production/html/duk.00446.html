            <p class="tei_p">A bright sky, but a very cold day—ice remains firm on the shade side of the
                street. I have been striving to raise enough to buy ½ ton of coal—quite
                exhausted—more so than at any time this season.</p>

                near you—that she might furnish, and enjoy with you the bright Camden
                sunshine—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am quite broken down at times; irritable from this epidemic—I make two coal
                fires and have the sitting room and <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">kichen​ </span></span> well warmed, when she comes down, but a man is not precisely the kind of
                servant a woman needs. Mrs. Church<a href="#n5001" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5001">2</a> is very clever but she has a house full of
                boarders. She is very thorough and competent.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am puzzled at times how to continue—I sleep well—yet I need rest other
                ways. I feel at times that I shall be compelled to give up—I have something
                like the <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">eumonia​ </span></span> at times too, in my left chest. I have no physician.</p>
