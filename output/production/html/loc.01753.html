                    your week of laying off, &amp; of the playing of the band under Schneider and
                        Petrola—also about City RR. men—I send my love
                    &amp; best respects to all of them—</p>  

                <p class="tei_p">—I have had a bad spell again this week—for three days I have had a
                    succession of those <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">blurs</span> again—only very much
                    worse than ever before—last night I slept pretty well, &amp; havn't had
                    any of them yet to-day, but my head feels sore &amp; ready to have them, almost
                    if I move across the room—I am sitting here, feeling pretty bad, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01753.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01753.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01753.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> my head unsettled

                <p class="tei_p">—Still Pete I do not get discouraged but think it will pass over, &amp; I
                    shall feel better, &amp; strong enough to come back to Washington—Still I
                    don't know—I think it best to face my situation—it is pretty
                    serious. I send you a card—&amp; if I should get bad, I will certainly
                    send you word, or telegraph—I will write Monday or Tuesday next—We
                    have moved into my brother's new house—I am up in the 3<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span> story room, fronting south—the sun is
                    shining in bright—it is beautiful October weather here—My brother
                    had a large room, very handsome, on 2<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">d</span> floor, with
                    large bay window fronting west built for me, but I moved up here instead, it is
                    much more retired, &amp; has the sun—I am very comfortable here indeed,
                    but my <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">heart</span> is blank &amp; lonesome utterly</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I have just been talking with a young married RR man Thomas Osler, I fell in
                    with—he has a bad bone-gathering on his left hand, a sort of felon,
                    suffered greatly with it 5 days &amp; nights—had it lanced yesterday,
                    &amp; is better—he stood by the open window, 1<span class="superscript tei_hi tei_hi_rend_superscript">st</span> floor, &amp; talked with me, while I sat in an
                    arm-chair inside—he is a regular RR. man—you could tell by the cut
                    of his jib, low collar, cap, clean shirt (for holiday) dark complexion, &amp;
                    hard dark hands. I took quite a fancy to him &amp; <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">of
                        course</span>, I suppose he did to me—I believe he works on the
                    locomotive</p>
                <p class="tei_p">—Pete you must tell me how you put in the past week—I like such a letter as your last one—written two or three
                    different times—It gave me a good idea of what you are doing—&amp;
                    also of how things look in Washington.—I have written a line to Col.
                    Hinton &amp; shall write a line to Eldridge—</p>

                    Ed, poor man—Pete I have left you $200 &amp; my gold
                    watch—(but it will be much better for us to spend the money together,
                    &amp; I have no doubt we shall do so) This house is quite pleasant—it is
                    on the corner—fronts south—side to west—plenty of light and

                <p class="tei_p">Pete I have written plainly, because I want you to be prepared, if any thing
                    should happen to me—but I tell you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">honest</span>, I still
                    think I shall pull through—&amp; that I shall be able to write better
