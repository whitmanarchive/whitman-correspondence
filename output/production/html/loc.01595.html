                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Jack,</span><a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I send you a few lines, though there is nothing new or special with me. 
                I am still working here in the same place, and expect to be here all winter—(yet there is such a thing as a man's slipping up in his calculations, you know.) 
                My health keeps good, &amp; work easy. I often think of you, my loving boy, 
                and think whether you are all right &amp; in good health, &amp; working on 2d avenue yet.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I suppose you received the letter I sent you. I got yours November 15, 
                &amp; sent you a letter about the 20th or 21st<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I believe. I have not heard from you since.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Congress began here last Monday. I have been up to see them in session. The halls they meet in are magnificent. 
                The light comes all from the roof. The new part of the Capitol is very fine indeed.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> 
                It is a great curiosity to any one that likes fine workmanship both in wood &amp; stone. 
                But I hope you will come here &amp; see me, as you talked of<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—Whether we are indeed to have the chance 
                in future to be much together &amp; enjoy each other's love &amp; friendship<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>—or whether worldly affairs are to separate us—I don't know. But somehow I feel (if I am not dreaming) 
                that the good square love is in our hearts, for each other, while life lasts.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">As I told you in my previous letter, this city is quite small potatoes after living in New York. 
                The public buildings are large &amp; grand. Most of them are made of white marble, &amp; on a far grander scale 
                than the N. Y. City Hall; but the oceans of life &amp; people, such as in N. Y. &amp; the shipping &amp;c, 
                are lacking here. Still a young man ought to see Washington once in his life, any how. 
                Then I please myself with thinking it will be a pleasure to you to be with me. 
                Jack, I want you to write to me often as you can.
            </p>

                    streetcar conductor in New York, known, according to an unidentified notation on
                    his letter to Walt Whitman, as "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an
                    address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
                    Congress, Notebook #109), Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and October
                    5, 1868, and rode with him on his Second Avenue car; Flood had been a conductor
                    for ten years. After Whitman's return to Washington, there was a brief
                    correspondence, consisting of four extant letters from Whitman (dated <a href="med.00403">November 22, 1868</a>, <a href="loc.01596">February
                        23, 1871</a>, and <a href="loc.01597">March 8, 1871?</a>) and one
                    from the young man. Flood, somewhat better educated than some of Walt Whitman's
                    other conductor friends, wrote on <a href="yal.00124">January 11,
                    1869</a>: "Sir, It is with great pleasure that I sit down with pen in hand to
                    address a few lines to you." He informed Walt Whitman that he had lost his
                    position on New Year's Eve and that he was now seeking another job: "I shall
                    still continue to correspond and can never forget your kind friendship towards
                    me.…Your True and Ever intimate friend." According to the first listing of
                    his name in the New York Directory, in 1872–1873, he was at that time
                    either in the milk business or a milkman. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01595_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01595_n3"><span>Whitman's letter was
