        <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter of last Sunday &amp; Monday came safe—was glad to see you so cheerful
        &amp; feeling well, as seemed plain by the tone of the letter. All goes right with me. I am
        feeling well, &amp; business matters move along as favorably as could be expected, taking
        all things in consideration. The weather is elegant—We had rain here too last Saturday
        &amp; Sunday—&amp; since then it has been clear &amp; bright—I am out dashing
        around every day—fetch up home every night somewhere between 10 &amp; 1 oclock, quite
        tired. The river &amp; bay get more &amp; more beautiful, under these splendid September
        skies, the green waves &amp; white foam relieved by the white sails of the crowds of ships
        &amp; sail craft—for the shipping interest is brisker this fall than it has been for
        twelve years. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Say to Harry Hurt, Mr Shedd, Pensey
        &amp; George Bell, Baley Murdock,
        George Smith, Dr. &amp; Wash. Milburn, or any of the railroad boys, or other friends that may inquire after me, that I send them
        my best respects—not forgetting my friends Mr. &amp; Mrs. Nash—also Father Boyle—(By the
        bye, Pete, I have taken a great fearful drink of whiskey, in honor of the news that arrived
        night before last of Victor Emanuel entering Rome—I couldn't wait.) </p>

      <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Later—afternoon</span>—It is now between 3 and 4—I have
        been pitching in heavy to a great dish of stewed beef &amp; onions mother cooked for
        dinner—&amp; shall presently cross over to New York &amp; mail this letter—shall
        probably go to some amusement with a friend this evening—most likely Buckleys
          Serenaders—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Pete, dear son, I hope this will find you all right, &amp; every thing lovely—It will
        not be long now before I shall be back—Till then, take care of yourself, my loving
        son. </p>
