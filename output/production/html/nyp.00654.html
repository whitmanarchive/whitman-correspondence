            <p class="tei_p">Y'r card came this mn'g &amp; makes me gloomy all day—was hoping from Dr's and Horace's
                acc't's there would likely be a good, a long continuation of "let up" and easier
                time—&amp; hope indeed when this comes, there will be again—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Matters here ab't "the same subject continued" as my former writing—I don't see
                much of Dr B—he is engrossed with the meter business—&amp; has many
                acquaintances &amp; invitations—&amp; much to do any how—expects to
                return to Canada early the coming week.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">A raw not clear day—Dr B and Horace call'd—nothing specially new—much sympathy for
                Wm &amp; prayers &amp; hopes he is better much—Dr B is probably to return home within a day
                or so—much depends on him there—I am suffering among the rest with a bad obstinate
                lingering cold in the head—sitting here alone by the stove as I write—</p>
