                    (1839–1887) was a clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E.
                    Huntington Library, San Marino, California), Whitman called him "chief clerk." Ramsdell was the
                    Washington correspondent for the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> and the
                    Cincinnati <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Commercial</span>. On <a href="loc.01829">May 8,
                        1867</a>, Ramsdell reported the high praise that George Townsend, the
                    journalist (1841–1914), accorded to Whitman—"a stupendous
                    genius," "the song of a God." On <a href="loc.01830">July 17, 1867</a>, he
                    asked Whitman to do whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho,
                    against whom charges had been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman Edward
                    Dexter Holbrook (1836–1870), a Democrat from the Idaho Territory.
                    Actually, on July 12, 1867, Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a
                    "Report on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Charges</span> submitted by <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. E. D. Holbrook</span>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory], <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">against</span>
                    <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Hon. Milton Kelly</span>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of
                    Idaho" (National Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all
                    in Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by attorney general
                    Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) but inscribed by Whitman, dated July 20,
                    1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report is hereby adopted by me, &amp;
                    ordered to stand as the decision of this Office in the Case, so far as now
                    presented." On <a href="loc.01832">July 22, 1867</a>, Ramsdell apologized
                    for his "aggressiveness." Judge Kelly wrote to Whitman on June(?) 21, 1867
                    (National Archives), and again on <a href="yal.00125">August 9, 1867</a>.
                    On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow
                    (1832–1896), Secretary of the Treasury, that Whitman "be appointed to a
                    position in the Treasury Department" (National Archives &amp; Records Administration, Washington, D.C.). </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01830_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01830_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:

                    (1836–1870), a prominent attorney who became Idaho Territory's delegate in
                    1864, confronted Judge Milton Kelly in a courtroom in 1863. There were no courts
                    in the early years of the territory and many cases were delayed. Judge Kelly
                    arrived to judge civil cases, many of which stood upon demurrer. According to
                    the story, after the attorneys, of which Ned Holbrook was one, argued the
                    demurrers, Judge Kelly alternated overruling and sustaining the demurrers
                    without explanation. When confronted by Holbrook, Kelly replied, "Mr. Holbrook,
                    if you think a man can be appointed from one of the eastern states, come out
                    here and serve as a judge in Idaho on a salary of $3,000 a year, payable in
                    greenbacks worth forty cents on the dollar, and give <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">reasons</span> for everything he does, you are mightly mistaken" (James H.
