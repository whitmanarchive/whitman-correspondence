            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">Your letter of the 25th is at hand. We<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> are ready to commence on your work <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">at once</span> and have it got up with all possible speed.  The terms which we would propose are 10 percent of the retail price for your copyright. This is the usual allowance to authors, on works of merit. The most important point to be settled at first is the form in which the Poems shall appear. Do you prefer the 18 mo size such as your last volume or will you have it in a 12 mo volume?—or in Two 12 mo volumes, ?  How do you like the 32 mo <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">blue</span> &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">gold</span> style inaugurated by Ticknor &amp; Fields, in which they have published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">most</span> of the modern English Poets such as Tennyson, etc?<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">We invite an early reply on this point, and also say if you accept the terms—10 percent on all copies sold.  ONE of us will be in New York in a week or ten days and will call and see you, but that need not prevent negociations being continued by mail—until we have a personal interview.</p>

                    Ticknor and Fields began to print books in a distinctive "blue and gold"
