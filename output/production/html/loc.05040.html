                their own sake but mainly as messengers of the glad tidings that at the time
                of their dispatch you were in better health than when you last wrote to me. I hope

                We had a thoroughly enjoyable old fashioned Christmas day here—a sort of ideal
                day—a snow mantled outer world, a 
                keen frost and 
                a dry crisp atmosphere, but no sunshine—and we spent it in the orthodox fashion,
                beginning the day by listening to the Christmas Carollers singing their joyous
                songs &amp; choruses in the early morning—it was very nice to lie abed
                and hearken to the blending voices of the singers wafted in melody across the

                moonlit, snow-clad street—dining at the house of a friend in the orthodox
                English style upon roast goose &amp; plum pudding with (—tell it not
                in Gath!—) brandy
                sauce—finishing the day by a little social "party" at our house.

                Since then there has been a thaw but the temperature has again fallen to freezing
                &amp; there has been another slight fall of snow in the night. As I write the sun is shining
                fitfully on the white-roofed houses &amp; a few sparrows are pecking up the breadcrumbs
                on the outer window-sill. Poor brave, blithe-hearted, russet-coated little birdies!
                It is a hard winter for you and your tiny companions. I wonder how many of you will survive
                it to gladden our hearts &amp; to make our vernal woodlands vocal with your
