                We are having wonderful weather here—as mild as September or April—I look for 
                a sudden drop of the mercury almost any night. Just at present the dandelions are in blossom
                by thousands on the asylum lawns. I lecture tomorrow morning and a week from then (if all be well) give the last lecture of the course—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">then</span>
                I am going in for a rest and a good time. I think I have done more work the last 3 months than ever before in the same time—and I feel none the worse 
                thank the Lord. Right away after Christmas I shall go to work in <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">ernest​ </span></span> at my "Cosmic Consciousness" piece<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> and am in hopes of making a good thing of it. How

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                        Human Mind</span> (Philadelphia: Innes and Sons, 1905). In this volume, Bucke
                    discussed the profound awareness or state of "cosmic consciousness" that he
                    believed was achieved by such persons as Buddha, Jesus, Dante, and Whitman,
                    among others. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke claimed in 1872 that a reading

                    final illness. Carol J. Singley reports that "Longaker enjoyed talking with
