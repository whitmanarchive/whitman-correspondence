            <p class="tei_p">I have been with him quite a good deal, from day to day, was with him yesterday &amp; indeed almost every day, &amp; feel much interested in the young man. He has been very sick, &amp; seems to be so now, as I should judge, but the doctor says he will recover. I had a talk with the doctor yesterday, &amp; he says so still. But Erastus seems to me very sick, &amp; I thought I would write to you. He had some one write to you about two weeks ago, but has received no answer.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Erastus does not talk much, so I do not understand much about his affairs. I am merely a friend. The address of Erastus is</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Ward E, Armory Square Hospital | Washington D C</p>

                    diary: "Rank musician—typhoid fever—I visited him from the time he
                    was brought in the hospitals—he told me he had been sick off &amp; on for
                    several months" (Charles I. Glicksberg, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman and the
                        Civil War</span> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1933],
                    148–149). See also his letters from <a href="nyh.00002">August 10,
                        1863</a>
                     and <a href="loc.00789">September 15, 1863</a>
                    . On the verso of the
                    letter is a pass, dated August 1, 1863, issued to Samuel B. Haskell for the
                    purpose of visiting his son. The New-York Historical Society has a letter
                    written by J. M. Jansen—like Erastus, a musician in the Hundred and
                    Forty-first Regiment, New York Volunteers—on April 5, 1863, in which he
                    informed Mr. Haskell that his son would surely receive "his discharge after a
                    spel, so take things cool and dont borrow any trouble about him." Erastus added
                    a note to Jansen's letter: "I am not doing any duty any where now, I havent been
                    on duty since the 20th day of December." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
