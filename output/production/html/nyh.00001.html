            <p class="tei_p">I have been with him quite a good deal, from day to day, was with him yesterday &amp; indeed almost every day, &amp; feel much interested in the young man. He has been very sick, &amp; seems to be so now, as I should judge, but the doctor says he will recover. I had a talk with the doctor yesterday, &amp; he says so still. But Erastus seems to me very sick, &amp; I thought I would write to you. He had some one write to you about two weeks ago, but has received no answer.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Erastus does not talk much, so I do not understand much about his affairs. I am merely a friend. The address of Erastus is</p>
