            <p class="tei_p">I have just written a postal to your folks to say I wouldn't be down till Saturday afternoon (Ashland Station) &amp; I thought I would write you a line—Every thing goes well with me these times considering—health &amp; feelings better since I come back from Canada than for nine years past—(one of the ferry men told me he heard a lady say to another on the boat yesterday as I went off, "He looks older &amp; savager than ever, dont he? but there is a something—I dont wonder that Aleck is all taken up with him" &amp;c &amp;c—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Aleck</span>, the ferry man thought, was her husband)—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I am selling quite a good many of my books now<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—gives me something to do every day—so you see I have enough to put me in quite a good humor. Then upon going to look where I had my bound books boxed &amp; stored away, up in the garret at Mr. Scovel's, (I hadn't been to look after them in three years)—I found them not only in good condition but found I had twice as many as I calculated—yesterday I had the express man to bring two boxes of 'em home, &amp; left three boxes there still. I got a letter from the PM General, Canada<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—the missing letter not there—I am convinced it came to Haddonfield—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">2.40 afternoon</p>
                    
            <p class="tei_p">I have just had my dinner &amp; am up here in my third story room finishing this—it is a bright sunny day here, after the three days' storm—I have been alone all day, but busy &amp; contented—my room is just right for all the year except the very hottest months—the sun pours in here so nice, especially afternoons—I wish you was here to-day, Hank (I havn't got any <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">wine</span> though)—I see Hoag<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> yesterday, &amp; Seigfried too—every body is flying around—Election excitement now, very hot. Sports, newspaper men, &amp; politicians busy as the devil in a gale of wind—Love to you, dear son—I shall be down Saturday<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—</p>
