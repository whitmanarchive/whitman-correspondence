                    (1838–1916) was an American expatriate and book collector. Sears's father,
                    Robert Sears Sr. (1810–1892), was co-founder of the New York
                    printing-house of Sears and Cole, publishers of newspapers and illustrated
                    books. George Sears collected books and pamphlets for over twenty years while
                    living in New York City, and in 1893, sold his collection of works "technically
                    and historically illustrative of the printing industry" to William Evarts
                    Benjamin (1859–1940) for $25,000 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The American
                        Bookmaker</span> [June, 1893], 230). According to the report in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The American Bookmaker</span>, Sears had housed his "curious and
                    instructive literary gleanings in one large apartment of a well-ventilated
                    mansion, without any gas-light or artificial heat." Sears privately printed
                    several catalogues from his collection, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A Collection
                        of The Emblem Books of Andrea Alciati</span> (1888) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A

                    Kingston's Cataraqui Cemetery. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.03764_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.03764_n1"><span>This letter is addressed:

                    poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
