                    (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
                    August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
                    transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
                    February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
                    February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
                    and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
                    January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
                    (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
                    Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
                    Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's <a href="nyp.00193">September 11,
                    1864</a>. The
                    following September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was
                    appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until
                    his retirement in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was
                    prepared by Brown's family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
