                    (1779–1852) was an Irish poet, satirist, composer, and political
                    propagandist. The son of a Roman Catholic wine merchant, Moore graduated from
                    Trinity College in 1799 and then studied law in London. At Trinity, he was
                    introduced to members of the United Irish Society. Moore authored many long
                    poems and volumes of poetry and prose, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Irish

                    poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
                    manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
                    not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman

                    (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
                    slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
                    surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
