                    letter<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> (now before me) is postmarked 5 P.M. 15<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> (Sunday) and reaches me at 10 this A.M. [—] If
                your letter had been posted at 8.15 (the time you mention) I am not sure whether I
                should get it by the same mail here or whether prehaps it would come by afternoon
                mail and rea[c]h me 4. P.M. In a general way you may reckon from a day and a half to
                two days for a letter to pass from Camden or Philadelphia here. [—] Judging by
                your letter and by all accounts I think you are certainly on the mend Walt, and I
                hope we shall have you middling bright and lively again after a little.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> That would be a grand thing if we could only see it.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and

                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
