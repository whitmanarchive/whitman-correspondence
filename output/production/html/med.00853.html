            <p class="tei_p">You ask how long it takes a letter to come from you here—well your last
                    letter (now before me) is postmarked 5 P.M. 15<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> (Sunday) and reaches me at 10 this A.M. [—] If
                your letter had been posted at 8.15 (the time you mention) I am not sure whether I
                should get it by the same mail here or whether prehaps it would come by afternoon
                mail and rea[c]h me 4. P.M. In a general way you may reckon from a day and a half to
                two days for a letter to pass from Camden or Philadelphia here. [—] Judging by
                your letter and by all accounts I think you are certainly on the mend Walt, and I
                hope we shall have you middling bright and lively again after a little. That would be a grand thing if we could only see it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">About half of my folk <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_damage">[damage]</span>  are gone and going to Sarnia on a
                visit—Clare &amp; Ina went
                yesterday, Mrs B. Willie, &amp; Pardee go tomorrow morning. I shall have a quiet house for awhile. The
                weather here keeps perfect, quiet, <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible">[illegible]</span> hazy, sleepy
                days—You might fancy it the land of the Lotus Eaters but the devil of it is it
                is <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span>—wish it was—too much work here
                altogether—however perhaps too much is better than not enough and as long as
                one is able to do it it is not <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_damage">[damage]</span>  right to complain</p>
