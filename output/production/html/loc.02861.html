            <p class="tei_p">I was to tell you about my acquaintanceship with Tennyson, 
                which was a pleasant episode in my life at Haslemere Hearing of the extreme
                beauty of the scenery thereabouts &amp; specially of its comparative wildness &amp;
                seclusion, he thought he would like to find or build a house, to escape from the
                obtrusive curiosity of the multitudes who flock to the Isle of 
                Wight at certain

                seasons of the year—He is even morbidly sensitive on this point &amp; will not stir beyond
                his own grounds from <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">weeks​ </span><span class="tei_corr">week's​

      </span></span> end to avoid his admiring or inquisitive persecutors—So, knowing an
                old friend of mine, he called on me for particulars as to the resources of the
                neighbourhood—And I, good walker &amp; familiar with every least frequented spot of
                hill &amp; dale for some miles round, took him long rambles in quest of a site. Very
                pleasant rambles they were; Tennsyon, under the influence of the fresh, outdoor
                quite unconstrained life in new

                scenery &amp; with a cheerful aim, shaking off the languid ennuyée
                air, as of a man to whom nothing has longer a relish—bodily or mental that
                too often hangs about him. And we found something quite to his mind—a coppice
                of 40 acres hanging on the south side two thirds of the way up a hill some 1000 <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="feet​ ">ft</span>​  high—so as to be sheltered from the cold &amp; yet have the light, dry,
                elastic hill air—&amp; with, of course, a glorious outlook

                over the wooded weald of Sussex so richly green &amp; fertile &amp; looking almost as boundless as
                the great sweep of sky over it—the South Downs—the Surrey Hills &amp;
                near at hand the hill curving round in a fir-covered promontory, standing out very
                black &amp; grand between him &amp; the Sun set. Underfoot too a wilderness of
                beauty—fox gloves (I wonder if they grow in America) ferns, purple heath
                &amp;c &amp;c.—I don't suppose I shall see much more of him now I have left

                though I have had very friendly invitations; for I am a home bird—don't like staying
                out—wanted at home and happiest there. And I should not enjoy being with them
                in the grand mansion half so much as I did pic-nicing in the road &amp; watching the
                builders as we did. It is pleasant to see T. with children—little girls at
                least—he does not take to boys—but one of my girls was mostly on his knee
                when they were in the room &amp; he liked them very much. His two Sons are now both

                to hand—a sore disappointment
                to me, dear Friend. I can ill afford to lose the long &amp; eagerly watched for
                pleasure of a letter. If it seems to you there must needs be something unreal,
                illusive in a love that has grown up entirely without the basis of personal
                intercourse, dear Friend, then you do not yourself realize your own power, nor
                understand the full meaning of your own words—"whoso touches this, touches

                Real effects imply real causes. Do you suppose that an ideal figure conjured up by
                her own fancy could, in a perfectly sound healthy woman of my age; so happy in her
                children, so busy &amp; content, practical earnest, produce such real &amp;
                tremendous, effect—saturating her whole life, colouring every waking
                moment—filling her with such joys such such pains that the strain of them has
                been well nigh

                too much even for a strong frame, coming as it does, after twenty years of hard
                work? </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Therefore please dear Friend, do not "warn" me any more—it hurts so, as seeming
                to distrust my love—Time only can show how needlessly. My love, flowing ever
                fresh &amp; fresh out of my heart, will go with you in all your wanderings, dear
                Friend, enfolding you day and night soul &amp; body with tenderness that tries so
                vainly to utter itself in these poor helpless words, that clings closer than any
                man's love can cling. O, I could not live if I did not believe that sooner or later
                you will not be able to help stretching out your arms towards me &amp; saying "Come,
                my Darling."—When you get this will you post me an American News

                too.—The children are so well &amp; working with all their might. The
                school turns but more what I desired for them than I had
