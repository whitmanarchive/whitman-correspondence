            <p class="tei_p">I took from Dr Russell your letter to Mr Redpath, to stir some warm hearts to aid you in your blessed work among our sick &amp; wounded boys.  My sister, Mrs Charles P. Curtis, has already written you, her husband's tears and her own ones—your touching words, coined into gold, or greenbacks.  I inclose you to-day $30, the result of an application to my friends, the Misses Wigglesworth.
