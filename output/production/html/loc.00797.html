            <p class="tei_p">Your note of Oct 8, enclosing Dr Russell's of 4th to you, is just rec'd. Yours with $5, some weeks ago, came safely. The generosity of Dr. Russell, Mrs. Curtis, and the other friends, I will briefly say, tells daily &amp; nightly &amp; shall tell to the best of my power, upon my dear boys here, in hospital. I do not miss one day or night. (I guess we, I &amp; the wounded &amp;c, were made for each other.) I have written to Dr Russell, to Mrs Curtis &amp; to Miss Stevenson.

            <p class="tei_p">Do you want to print a little 30 or 50ct book about the scenes, war, camp, hospitals &amp;c (especially the &amp;c.)
            </p>
         <p class="tei_p">I shall probably remain here, in this thing. I am very happy. I never was so beloved. I am running over with health, fat, red &amp; sunburnt in face &amp;c. I tell thee I am just the one to go [to] our sick boys. Good by, my friend.
