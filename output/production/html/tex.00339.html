        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this over at the office—I have made a sort of commencement of my work to-day—I have rec'd this note (enclosed) from Lillie Townsend—Mother, I believe I will write them a few lines, soon—(What is Aunt
          Sally's name—is it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sarah Pintard</span>)—when you next write tell me—I am feeling quite
        well—(only easily put out with my head)—I have been in the office nearly three
        hours to-day, &amp; have got along comfortable—I can only move slowly yet—cannot
        walk any—at least any distance—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Wednesday, April 2.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am over at the office—feel rather slim to-day—but the weather is so
        pleasant, I shall feel better I think—Your letter has just come, &amp; I am glad as
        always to hear from you all—you say George's house is commenced, the cellar
        begun—I like to hear all about its progress—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I see in the papers this morning an awful shipwreck yesterday night—seems to me the worst ever happened, a first-class, big
        steamship from England, went down almost instantly, 700 people lost, largely women &amp;
        children, just as they got here, (towards Halifax)—what misery, to many thousand
        relatives &amp; friends—Mother, I send you the Graphic—the pictures are
          amusing—(I thought I would write a line to the
        Townsends, mostly on Aunt Sally's account, as it may humour her)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, I believe that is all to-day—I hope this will find you feeling well &amp; in good heart, dearest
        mother—Love to Brother George &amp; Sister Lou—</p>
