      <p class="tei_p">I am sitting in my room waiting for the doctor—Mother, you are in my mind most of the
        time—I do hope as I write this you are feeling better—dear mother, do not get
        discouraged—there is so much in keeping good heart, (if one only can)—I think
        that is what has kept me up, &amp; is bringing me through—I think I am still on the
        gain, though it is very slow—my breakfast is brought up yet, has been this
        morning—I don't go out till about noon—then I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">hitch</span> over
        to the office, &amp; stay there for a couple of hours—then I hitch out &amp; get in
        the cars &amp; take quite a long ride, (sometimes jolting pretty lively, as the track is
        bad—but I don't mind it much)—I don't eat any dinner, only a light lunch, as I
        find it is much better for me—I certainly don't get behindhand any, that's pretty
        clear, &amp; I count on time bringing me all right—the only thing I think of now is
        you, dear mother, &amp; about your getting well and strong as usual—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I got your letter yesterday (Thursday)—I suppose you got mine yesterday—I sent
        Hattie<a href="#n0706" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0706">2</a> a late "Graphic,"<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> &amp; one to Han<a href="#n0285" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0285">4</a>
        also—(the same as the last one I sent to you)—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">It is singular how much nervous disease there is—and many cases of paralysis &amp;
        apoplexy—I think there is something in the air, for a year past, last summer,
        especially—Fortunately, it seems as if most people got over it—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Friday afternoon—1 oclock </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am over at the office—Have got a letter from Sister Lou<a href="#n0368" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0368">5</a> written Thursday
          morning,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> which gives me great relief, as it says that Sunday
        was your worst day, &amp; that you have got relief now—Dear, dear mother, I hope you
        are still getting better—you must try to feel good courage—I shall come on soon,
        probably about the 1st of June—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have got a letter from John Burroughs this morning<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a>—he
        &amp; wife are both a little homesick, for Washington—they had got a nice home
        here—but he is going to sell it—&amp; settle up there—he does better
        there—but he was doing well enough here, &amp; was very comfortable—My head
        troubles me to-day, but I am over here at my desk, at office—Mother, if convenient
        write me a line Sunday, so I will get it Monday—</p>

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.

                        persons had been present. "On taking my seat among them, I noticed a curious
                        thumping at intervals that made the floor vibrate beneath my feet. I was so
                        absorbed in my own grief that at first I was hardly conscious of it. I
                        finally left my chair, and going to the back of the room where we were
                        sitting, I noticed a half-opened door leading to another room. Glancing in,
                        I saw the poet all alone by the side of his mother's coffin. He was bent
                        over his cane, both hands clasped upon it, and from time to time he would
                        lift it and bring it down with a heavy thud on the floor. His sister-in-law
                        told me that he had sat there all through the previous night."</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li></ul>
