                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was

                    was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
                    fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
                    meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
                    sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a <a href="nyp.00661">March 18,
                        1888</a>, letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical

                    Kennedy's book manuscript "Walt Whitman, Poet of Humanity." Kennedy had reported
                    in a letter to Whitman of <a href="loc.07694">January 2, 1888</a> that
                    Frederick W. Wilson was willing to publish the study. But Kennedy wrote to
                    Whitman on <a href="loc.03054">November 5, 1889</a>: "Fred. Wilson writes
                    me that if he publishes I must pay cost of production. I can't, so I write him
                    to return the MS. to me. I must wait till I get able." Bucke planned to advance
                    Kennedy the money for publication when the meter enterprise became profitable.
                    Kennedy's manuscript eventually became two books, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> (1896) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Fight

                    Paisley, Scotland, a publisher who reissued a number of books by and about
                    Whitman, ultimately published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt
                        Whitman</span> in 1896 after a long and contentious battle with Kennedy over
                    editing the book. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
