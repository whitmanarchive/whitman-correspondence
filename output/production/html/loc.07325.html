            <p class="tei_p">It is after tea (7 P.M.), I am over in my office—gas lit, blinds drawn down,
                quite snug. Received today "Le Temps" and your
                letter enclosing Kennedy's note, all welcome. Do not be uneasy about 
                Mrs Costelloe, she is young and strong and will
                rally—will probably be better than ever in a year from now and will know
                enough to keep well next time. If I saw the least prospect of her not recovering I
                should feel it as a terrible calamity—but I do not—she will get well all
                right—do not be uneasy about that. All well here and all going right. No
                further word from Willy Gurd but I look for him here within the
                next 2 or 3 weeks

                without fail. I note what Kennedy says about the publication
                of the book (his "W.W.") as soon as I get a few hundred that
                I can spare (and I look for that time to come very
                soon now) it is my intention to advance the funds required for I am very
                anxious to have K's book printed and so made safe—put on record for good.
                I have many other schemes to go into when the needful is
                forthcoming—I am not in a hurry (there is no hurry) if I live I shall see some
                of them through yet—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Who fights for the truth has strong backers—I am not uneasy—we shall
                certainly come out O.K. in the end</p>
