                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    had received three payments from Rossetti amounting to $446.18 (see the
                    letter from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of <a href="uva.00483">December 4,
                        1885</a>). Including the gift from Carpenter and the Ford sisters (see his
                    letter to Edward Carpenter of <a href="tex.00446">August 3, 1885</a>)
                    Whitman received in 1885 from his English admirers a total of $686.01. In
                    contrast, his royalties from McKay for the year totalled $42.77; he also
                    received $24 from Worthington and about $47.50 from Scott (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In 1885 Whitman
                    received at least $350.20 from sales of poems and articles: "Washington's
                    Monument, February, 1885" ($10), "As One by One Withdraw the Lofty Actors"
                    ($30), "Fancies at Navesink" ($145.20), "Booth and 'The Bowery'"
                    ($60), "Slang in America" ($50), "Some Diary Notes at Random" ($10),
                    "Abraham Lincoln" ($33), and "The Voice of the Rain" ($12). It could not
                    be ascertained how much he received from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Critic</span> for
                    the right to reprint the poem on Grant or from the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Star</span> for "How Leaves of Grass Was Made." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
