            <p class="tei_p">I think <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> not only much the best name for the book, but a first-rate good name, appropriate, original &amp; fresh, without being at all affected or strained. The piece you put 4th should then be <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">first</span>—should lead the book, giving it its title, &amp; having the name of the piece changed to "Birds and Poets"—which I think would be an improvement. The whole collection would be sufficiently homogeneous, (and it were a fault to be too much so)—You just want <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a hint</span> for the name of a book—Only it must be in the spirit of the book—&amp; not too much so either. "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nature and Genius" is too Emersony altogether</span>.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a></p>
   
            <p class="tei_p"> I will think over the name of the piece devoted to me, &amp; will in a couple of days write you the result. May-be I can think of a better name. I have not rec'd the MS from Church.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> You send on any thing—any MS—which I will cheerfully read &amp; will return with any suggestions that may occur to me—I keep pretty well for me—</p>
