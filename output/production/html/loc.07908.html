            <p class="tei_p">Postcard of 15<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> from you came to hand yesterday—very quiet here—guess it is much the same with you but am sorry
                to see that you still have only a poor time of it with your troublesome ailments—glad to see however that Horace who is
                with you so much fancies you are doing well—this goes to show that even if you <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">suffer</span> (as undoubtedly
                you do) your constitution is bearing up wonderfully well under it and will perhaps shake off some of it yet. I go
                to Toronto tuesday (day-after-tomorrow) to consult with the government in the case "Ross v. Bucke" Shall know then (I suppose)
                whether they are going to stand by me—guess they will—guess they must—but will tell you definitely when
                I know myself—we are all well—shoulder nearly all right again
