                    <p class="tei_p">Whitman's relations with his book agents were complicated and troubling
                        during these years. O'Kane, a New York book dealer, took over the books
                        still in the possession of Michael Doolady (a bookseller to whom Whitman
                        wrote on <a href="loc.01566">November 13, 1867</a>) on April 22, 1874.
                        On December 29, 1873, Whitman withdrew his books from O'Kane, and also
                        dismissed Piper, the Boston outlet. At the same time he entrusted the whole
                        matter to Asa K. Butts and Co., which went into bankruptcy in the following
                        year. Though Whitman wrote cordially to O'Kane on <a href="loc.01717">April 22, 1874</a>, he later became hostile. Citing only the
                        initials, Richard Maurice Bucke, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span>
                        (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), in his "official" biography (46), averred
                        that O'Kane and Somerby, Butts's successor, "took advantage of [Walt
                        Whitman's] helplessness to embezzle the amounts due—(they calculated
                        that death would soon settle the score and rub it out.)" This sounds like an
                        interpolation composed by the poet himself; note also Whitman's <a href="yal.00418">December 30, 1875</a> letter to Jeannette Gilder,
                        in which he wrote, "every one of the three successive book agents I have had
                        in N. Y. has embezzled the proceeds." In an address book now held in the
                        Library of Congress, Walt Whitman scrawled on a piece of O'Kane's
                        stationery, "rascal."</p>
