            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 12th recd. I sent Dowden's letter soon after getting it, to O'Connor, with
                written request on it to send to Dr Bucke, with similar request to him to send to
                you—I supposed you had it a fortnight or more ago. I yesterday wrote to
                O'Connor about it asking him to forward to you directly. The same round (to
                O'C—to Dr. B and to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span>) to a long notice of
                "Specimen Days" in the "Academy" by Dowden—I supposed you had rec'd
                both—I fancy you certainly will get them—perhaps you have
                already—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have those Emerson vols (just as you lent them to me over 10 years ago) boxed up
                &amp; stored with other traps in Washington at the house
                of old Mr Nash, Peter Doyle's uncle—Shall surely have the boxes here before
                long, (or go on &amp; overhaul them) &amp; if that will do—will certainly see the
                vols are sent to you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am quite over my bad spell of a month ago—havn't made any move from Camden yet, but shall—"Specimen Days" moves pretty
                sluggishly—no great demand—L of G. better, but by no means what was
                anticipated—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am more than satisfied, however—every thing might have been so much
                worse—&amp; best of all, in my mind, on looking over L of G. as it now
                stands—I don't worry about how much better it ought to be, but thankful it is
                as well as it is—I am content to let it rest, to let it go as it is, without the least wish to meddle with it any more, (a
                feeling I havn't had before, but now certainly
                settled.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have a criticism on Burns in to-morrows 'Critic'—Love to 'Sula and the dear
                little fellow—(I bear you all more in mind than you think for)—I hear
                there is a notice of L of G. in Dec. "Nineteenth Century"—</p>
