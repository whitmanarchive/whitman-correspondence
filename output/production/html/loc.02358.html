I need scarcely remark that you should receive a fair (—so far as publishers' fairness goes—) remuneration for the vol. If you do not disapprove of the project, perhaps, you would not mind cooperating with me in the production of the work, by pointing out the essays you wish rejected, revised, or included?

If you thought well of the idea you might like to take a part payment in sheets, or bound copies, from the publishers?  I would edit the work for England and prefix a short essay.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose prospectus of my Editions of Poe's works.

            <p class="tei_p">Have you had a good portrait of yourself etched, engraved, or made in any permanent form? If so, will you kindly favour me with a copy—will you kindly say cost &amp; will forward it you need not send till you get the money—or, if not any of this class, will you kindly send me another photo like that in the "Two Rivulets"? Only <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not mounted</span> as I want it for mounting in my own fashion, safest way of sending is round a small wooden roller.

                    (1842–1916), an English editor, collector, and biographer, wrote several
                    memoirs about Edgar Allan Poe, largely in opposition to a Poe memoir written in
                    1850 by Rufus W. Griswold, which Ingram deemed inaccurate and filled with lies.
                    Ingram also wrote critical studies of Thomas Chatterton and Christopher Marlowe.

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
