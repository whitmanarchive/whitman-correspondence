            <p class="tei_p">If you will permit me to address you thus—for some time past I have been collecting Tales, and other prose sketches by you, and now want to edit them for a vol., if you see no objection? I need scarcely remark that you should receive a fair (—so far as publishers' fairness goes—) remuneration for the vol. If you do not disapprove of the project, perhaps, you would not mind cooperating with me in the production of the work, by pointing out the essays you wish rejected, revised, or included? Will you let me know your views? My <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">name</span>

            is known to your friend Mr. O'Connor, of Washington, and, personally, I am well known to Mr. W.M. Rossetti, through whom I had the pleasure of subscribing for the "Two Rivulets." If you thought well of the idea you might like to take a part payment in sheets, or bound copies, from the publishers?  I would edit the work for England and prefix a short essay.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I enclose prospectus of my Editions of Poe's works. I have just published a new vindication "Memoir of Poe" in 2 vols. and am <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">always</span> desirous of gathering up information about him: Can you help me?

            <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">any</span> correspondence with him you would permit me to see, or anything about him, or any reminiscences? He published some remarks of yours on "Music" in his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Broadway Journal</span>; with a few words of approval, in 1845. You may, therefore, have known him.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Have you had a good portrait of yourself etched, engraved, or made in any permanent form? If so, will you kindly favour me with a copy—will you kindly say cost &amp; will forward it you need not send till you get the money—or, if not any of this class, will you kindly send me another photo like that in the "Two Rivulets"? Only <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not mounted</span> as I want it for mounting in my own fashion, safest way of sending is round a small wooden roller. Hoping your recent travel has done your health good, and to hear from you speedily,</p>
