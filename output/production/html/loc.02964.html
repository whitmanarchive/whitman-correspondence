            <p class="tei_p">Thanks for the 13th note—write oftener—I have been thro another very bad
                spell—ten days, two of them quite serious—but am somewhat
                better—am sitting up anyhow writing this, but my brain is flabby—my grip
                weak—The doctor speaks of a pronounc'd gastric trouble, from long
                indigestion—No I have no recollection of any "Solitude"—have no doubt it is a total invention (not to use
                the word <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fraud</span> wh' is perfectly proper)—my relations
                were never at all intimate with Lowell—there are a good many such—it
                might be worth while to stamp them peremptorily in future—I have included all
                my stuff in "Complete Vol," a big book authenticated by me now, rather cheaply bound
                &amp; I w'd like to send a package of four or five copies (including one to you) by
                Express to you—one for Garland, one for Baxter and one for Mrs. Fairchild—all for Christmas presents—package to be prepaid—can you
                receive it &amp; see they get to their destination?—Where shall it (the
                package) be directed to you, in Boston, if so?—I have seen the notice in the
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Literary World</span> &amp; like
                it well enough—Dr Bucke (I hear from him often) likes it
                well—do you know its author? The Paris (France) <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Revue
                    Independent</span> magazine November has a notice L of G.—also something in
                a Palermo (Italy) paper—Dr B has them—No word now for quite a while from
                my dear O'Connor—I am very uneasy ab't him—I
                have (did I tell you?) a good strong willing nurse, &amp; good
                doctoring watch—I send my love &amp; memories to Mrs: F., to Baxter, to
                Garland, to yourself, dear friend, &amp; wife—&amp; to Sanborn if you see him—I must now get to the bed—</p>
