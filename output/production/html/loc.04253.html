            <p class="tei_p">Your nice letter came all right, &amp; I was glad to hear from you, &amp; the news
                around there—I put in quite a busy day yesterday—in the forenoon, 9 to
                10, went to the funeral of a valued friend of mine—then had three visitors
                made long calls during the day—I was glad to see them all—one from
                Boston, I had long wanted to see—<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gt.00002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gt.00002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>then middle of the afternoon went
                to the polls to vote, (election day here yesterday)—and went over to
                Philadelphia on a jaunt &amp; visit from 4 to 6½—But today it is raining
                &amp; blowing at a great rate, &amp; I am staying in writing,—give my love to
                your father &amp; mother—I am sorry to hear by your letter she is not very
                well—I hope you fly around &amp; spare her as much as possible in the
                work—I shall be down Friday in the 4½ afternoon train to Kirkwood if it dont storm</p>
