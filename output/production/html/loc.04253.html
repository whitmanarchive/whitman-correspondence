                10, went to the funeral of a valued friend of mine—then had three visitors
                made long calls during the day—I was glad to see them all—one from

                to the polls to vote, (election day here yesterday)—and went over to
                Philadelphia on a jaunt &amp; visit from 4 to 6½—But today it is raining
                &amp; blowing at a great rate, &amp; I am staying in writing,—give my love to
                your father &amp; mother—I am sorry to hear by your letter she is not very
