            <p class="tei_p">this is a sad house to-day—little Walt died last
                evening about ¼ past 8. Partially sick but sudden at last—suddenly turned
                to water on the brain—is to be buried to-morrow afternoon at 4—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">George and Lou are standing it pretty 
                well—I am miserable—he knew me so
                well—we had already such good times—&amp; I was counting so
                much—My St. Louis nieces are here—they 
                are well—Nelly dear, send me back their photos &amp; 
                Jeff's—the heat here has been &amp; is
                dreadful—Love to you—write—</p>
