            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of Sunday has come, &amp; I am glad to get those impromptu well filled
                yellow sheets—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">write again</span>—I have not heard any
                more from O'Connor—when I do I will tell you—I write or send papers or
                something every day—Have just had my
                dinner—a great piece of toasted Graham bread salted &amp; well buttered with
                fresh country butter, &amp; then a lot of good panned oysters dumped over it, with
                the hot broth—then a nice cup custard &amp; a cup of coffee—So if you
                see in the paper that I am <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">starving</span> (as I saw it the other
                day) understand how—I enclose Rhys's letter rec'd this morning—As I understand it, Wilson is no more in the
                W[ilson] &amp; McC[ormick] partnership, Glasgow, but sets up by himself—</p>
