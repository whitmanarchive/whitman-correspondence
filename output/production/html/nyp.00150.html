                    check on the welfare of Babbitt. As Whitman informed Mrs. Curtis in the letter,
                    Caleb Babbitt suffered a sun stroke in July and was admitted to Armory Square
                    Hospital. According to the "Hospital Note Book" (Henry E. Huntington Library),
                    Babbitt had been in Mobile earlier. About August 1, he left Washington on
                    furlough. On <a href="nyp.00143">August 18, 1863</a>, Caleb's sister, Mary
                    A. Babbitt informed Whitman of Caleb's arrival in Barre, Massachusetts; because
                    of his exhaustion he was unable to write. Mary acknowledged Whitman's letter on
                        <a href="nyp.00145">September 6, 1863</a>, and wrote that Caleb was
                    "not quite as well as when I wrote you before…he wishes me to tell you to keep
                    writing…for your letters do him more good than a great deal of medicine." On
                        <a href="nyp.00146">September 18, 1863</a>, at the expiration of his
                    forty-day furlough, Caleb was strong enough to write: "Walt&#x97;In your letters
                    you wish me to imagine you talking with me when I read them, well I do, and it
                    does very well to think about, but it is nothing compared with the original." On
                        <a href="nyp.00148">October 18, 1863</a>, Babbitt was depressed ("dark
                    clouds seem to be lying in my pathway and I can not remove them nor hide them
                    from my mind") until he mentioned his beloved, Nellie F. Clark, who "has saved
                    me." See also Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00801">October 28,
                        1863</a>, <a href="med.00304">December 27, 1863</a>, and <a href="med.00305">February 8, 1864</a>. (This letter is in two pieces, on
                    the verso of which appears the draft letter to Bethuel Smith from <a href="loc.00787">October 7, 1863</a>.) </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
