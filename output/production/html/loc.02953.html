            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your p.c. of yesterday came at breakfast time. I often wish that I <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">could</span> write you a long letter, &amp; tell you all about
                us, but as I wrote you, my head &amp; eyes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gave out</span>, &amp;
                I can write but very little, even to my two sisters,— &amp; we are all that
                are left of the family of nine, seven children &amp; the father &amp; mother. But
                one <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02953.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> night last week I
                had a most vivid dream of you, &amp; thought I should write that day, but the many
                duties that came each day prevented it. I am sorry that I have not better news to
                give you of William. He has failed very much in the last six weeks, indeed I date
                the marked change for the worse from the paralysis of the eye lid, &amp; that was
                the last of Sept., but a very marked change for the worse since <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02953.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Nov. 23d. No one is as
                well aware of it as I am, for I see him at his worst, as well as his best. I am his
                sole &amp; only nurse, &amp; help to dress, undress &amp; bathe him, &amp; he is
                under no restraint to say how he <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">always</span> puts the best face
                on things to every one, &amp; is always ready to joke about himself, &amp; often
                makes me laugh when I am ready to cry. But now he often debates whether he shall <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02953.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> go out at all, &amp;
                does not go till 11 or 10:30 A.M. &amp; sometimes later. He, until very lately,
                would almost resent the idea of staying at home when I suggested it,—but
                locomotion is becoming more &amp; more labored, &amp; when I am helping him to get
                up &amp; down, I have sometimes wondered if I shall be able to lift him more &amp;
                more, as he is less able to lift himself, as he weighs 200 or more &amp; I 105.
                Until lately, too, he has had the most wonderful courage, &amp; would <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02953.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">not</span> give up, but it is not so all the time now. Still,
                there is one thing in his favor, (if one so regards it) &amp; that is that he is
                still <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">determined</span> to live, I never saw such clinging to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">this life</span>, in any one; &amp; he still feels that if
                the right doctor could be found that he could be made entirely well. He counted up
                the other day, &amp; found that he had had <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fifteen</span>
                doctors. Besides the "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">paresis</span>" he suffers from
                inconveniences of various <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02953.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> other kinds, which follow from his not being able to reach the
                water closet in time. Then he has had inflammation, some time ago, in one, &amp;
                then the other <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">toe</span>, lately the second finger of the right
                hand, was very bad, &amp; is not wholly well yet. I look at him &amp; wonder how any
                one can want to live who suffers so; the body seems to me such a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prison</span> under these conditions. But his deepest unhappiness
                now is that he has not yet been able to <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02953.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02953.007.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> get his article published which he wrote
                in defense of Donnelly, &amp; as yet, he has not. He put life
                &amp; energy into it, &amp; said if he could only get to New York he could get it
                into the right magazine.</p>
