            <p class="tei_p">Again "the same subject continued"—decidedly cold to-day—a good fire
                needed—I ate a good breakfast of stew'd chicken, brown bread, a roast apple
                &amp; chocolate ab't 10—am writing &amp; reading a little—friendly
                notices of Nov: B. in Bost: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span> (by Kennedy)—&amp; in to-day's

                verdict on me?)—bowel movements fair—no hitch in the progress of the big
                book, but slow—my dull indomitable inertia of body &amp; brain tyrannic as
                ever—This enc: f'm <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> just rec'd—I have
