                    photographer George Cox (1851–1903) proposed selling signed copies of his
                    photographs of Whitman. However, when the September 1887 issue of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span> appeared with an advertisement, Whitman still had
                    not seen proofs, much less signed the photographs. He wrote John H. Johnston on
                        <a href="sal.00004">September 1, 1887</a>, "He advertises . . . to
                    sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is forged, &amp; the former illegal
                    &amp; unauthorized." The disagreement was quickly resolved, and Whitman signed
                    photographs for Cox and returned them. Cox had taken multiple photographs of
                    Whitman in April, 1887, including the image known as "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image103.html?sort=year&amp;order=descending&amp;page=3">The Laughing Philosopher</a>." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
