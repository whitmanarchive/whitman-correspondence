                <p class="tei_p">The sultry weather of last week has passed, &amp; cooler delightful weather set in.
                Has been a beautiful day today (though occasionally threatening) &amp; the evening has
                been especially lovely, with the most beautiful roseate sky &amp; clouds.</p>

                The air was sweet &amp; calm, but with a just felt breeze,—a slight pensive
                mist half veiling the distant landscape. I was quite loathe to return indoors, but I wanted

                I wondered again who had written these.—It seems strange to me that since such

                should have proceeded so slowly. But it is very certain, &amp; will be all the more
