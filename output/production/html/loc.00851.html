         <p class="tei_p">I<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> am disconsolate at your long stay.  What has become of you?  On returning the 7th of July I found you had gone home sick.  You have no business to be sick, so I expect you are well.  I was so unlucky as to be sick myself all the time I was home—and most of the time since I came back.  I am quite well now, however, and feel like myself.  Benton<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> and I looked for you at <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">Leedsvill​ </span></span>, as I wrote to you to come.  If you have leisure now, you would enjoy hugely a visit up there.  I hope you are printing Drum Taps, and that this universal drought does not reach your "grass."  But make haste and come back.  The heat is delicious  I have a constant bath in my own perspiration.  I was out at the front during the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">siege of Washington</span> and lay in the rifle pits with the

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, even
                    though Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently
                    defended Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
                    commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
                    was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
                    men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
                    write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</span> (New York: American News Co.,
                    1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1896),
                    and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting the Universe</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
                    1920). For more information on Burroughs see <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
