                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    (1807–1892) was an American poet who is remembered as one of the most
                    popular of the Fireside Poets and for his anti-slavery writings. He was the
                    author of numerous collections of poetry, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Maud
                        Muller</span> (1860) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Snow-Bound </span>(1866). As a poet,
                    he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not surprisingly, he was not an
                    admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For Whitman's view of Whittier, see
                    the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (various publishers:
