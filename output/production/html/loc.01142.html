                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Walt.</span>
                </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I was much disturbed by your card. I had been thinking of you as probably enjoying these superb autumn days down in the country at Kirkwood, &amp; here you are wretched &amp; sick at home. I trust you are better now. You need a change. I dearly wish that as soon as you are well enough 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01142.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01142.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01142.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01142.002_large.jpg</span>
                you would come up here &amp; spend a few weeks with us. We could have a good time here in my bark-covered shanty &amp; in knocking about the country. Let me know that you will come.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The "Specimen Days &amp;c" came all right. I do not like the last part of the title; it brings me up with such a short turn. I have read most of the new matter &amp; like it of course. I have not seen any notices of the book yet.

                I have just <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">recd</span>​  an English book—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Familiar Studies of men &amp; books</span>—by Stevenson with an essay upon you in it. But it does not amount to much. He has the American vice of smartness &amp; flippancy. I do not think you would care for the piece.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am bank examining nowadays, but shall be free again pretty soon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">O'Connor writes me that he is going to <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="publish​ ">pub</span>​  his <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> letters in a pamphlet, with some other matter; I am glad to hear it. He draws blood every time.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I fear poor old Alcott will not rally; indeed he may be dead now. I had a pleasant letter from him the other day. I had sent him a crate of Concord grapes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am very stupid to-day. For the past two weeks my head has been ground between the upper &amp; nether millstone of bank ledgers &amp; it is sore. We are all well. Julian is a fine large boy. Drop me a card when you receive this; also write me when you will come up.</p>
