            <p class="tei_p">S. was away when your picture came, attending his sick brother, Charles—who has since died—an event that has <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="saddened​ ">sadden'd</span>​  me much. Charlie was younger than S., and a most attractive young fellow. He <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="worked​ ">work'd</span>​  at my father's, and had done so for two years. He was about the best specimen of a young country farm-hand I ever knew. You would have loved him. He was like one of your poems. With his great strength, his blond hair, his cheerfulness and contentment, his universal good will, and his silent manly ways, he was a youth hard to match. He was <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="murdered​ ">murder'd</span>​  by an old doctor. He had typhoid fever, and the old fool bled him twice. He lived to wear out the fever, but had not strength to rally. He was out of his head nearly all the time. In the morning, as he died in the afternoon, S. was standing over him, when Charlie put up his arms around S.'s neck, and <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="pulled​ ">pull'd</span>​  his face down and <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="kissed​ ">kiss'd</span>​  him. S. said he knew then the end was near. (S. stuck to him day and night to the last.) When I was home in August, Charlie was cradling on the hill, and it was a picture to see him walk through the grain. All work <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="seemed​ ">seem'd</span>​  play to him. He had no vices, any more than Nature has, and was <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="beloved​ ">belov'd</span>​  by all who knew him.</p>

<p class="tei_p">I have written thus to you about him, for such young men belong to you; he was of your kind. I wish you could have known him. He had the sweetness of a child, and the strength and courage and readiness of a young Viking. His mother and father are poor; they have a rough, hard farm. His mother works in the field with her husband when the work presses. She has had twelve children.</p>
