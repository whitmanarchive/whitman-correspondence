            <p class="tei_p">About the pleasantest news of the
                morning, here, is that of the report made by the Territorial Committee of eight, in
                the United States Senate, on the subject of the Oregon bill, slavery, a government
                for California and New Mexico, and so forth. Surely this is the way to settle the
                matter; and just as surely, all sensible and clear-minded men will come into it. The
                great beauty of the "laissez faire" doctrine is exemplified here—the gem above all
                price for our country—contains more vital and preservative power for the Union, than
                all the schemes of all the modern politicians combined.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">How are you receiving this
                report in the south-west? Do you not like it? Is it not perfectly consistent with
                the rights of all parties: and, above all, with the rights of the inhabitants (whom,
                by-the-bye, nobody seems to think any thing about,) of the territories themselves?
                The probability appears to be, almost beyond a doubt, that the plan reported by the
                committee of eight will satisfy the body of the "Free Soilers"<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">1</a> of the north and
                west. It is almost sure, however, that they will meet in convention at Buffalo, in
                less than three weeks, and "pile up" their endorsement of Van Buren<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">2</a> for the
                Presidency.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">The meeting of the Barnburners<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> in the Park last evening was a very large
                and somewhat tumultuous gathering. Martin Grover, M.C.,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> made a long and animated
                speech. At its close a few young Cass<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">5</a> and Butlerites<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> attempted some vigorous pushes,
                in the way of a row; but the "unterrified" rallied in great anger round a flag with
                the portrait of Martin Van Buren on it, and drove the enemy from the field, with
                divers bloody noses and contusions. It was one of those pleasant commentaries on
                political freedom, which act on the rest of its articles like the pepper of a
                wholesome soup. The police here never interfere in these interesting feuds—which is
                right and proper.</p>   
            <p class="tei_p">For some time past the strife between our New York Guelphs and
                Ghibellines<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">7</a> has been for the possession of Old Tammany, the Mecca of the Democracy.
                Keen and exquisite have been the tactics of either; but night before last the
                Sachems, who have control of the matter, met in solemn council, and decided that Van
                Burenism <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">should</span> formally enter the wigwam, and directed the rooms of the Hall to be
                placed at its use. In the meeting of last evening, a son of Mr. F. P. Blair,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">8</a> of the
                old democratic organ, the Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Globe</span>, addressed the audience in behalf of Van
                Buren.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Among the late improvements of New York, may be particularly mentioned the
                long-talked-of widening of William street, now nearly completed. For ten years past
                Nassau street, from Wall to Chatham, has been one of the most crowded thoroughfares
                in the city. Unfortunately it is at the same time one of the narrowest and most
                inconvenient. At any hour of the day, and particularly towards dusk, it is a
                difficult feat to thread the walks of Nassau street, without some unpleasant
                jostling and squeezing. Tangling of carts, with much detention and cartmen’s oats,
                is an hourly occurrence. These difficulties could not well be obviated by enlarging
                the area of the oppressed avenue itself, which is lined with the most valuable
                structures, Clinton Hall among the rest; so they thought to draw off some of the
                travel into William street, and open it into Chatham just opposite the junction of
                the latter streets and Chambers. A good device all 'round, this is generally
                considered—though the putting of it in execution has made the dust fly in what was
                formerly the very heart of the city, (answering to your First Municipality,) for
                months past. For my part, I am astonished that, while they were about it, they
                did’nt make the street twenty feet wider instead of six. It will undoubtedly be a
                great convenience both to vehicles and pedestrians. They have for the last four or
                five days, been tearing down the houses (in the verg middle of the Jew clothing
                quarter) in Chatham street, to make the exit of William. It has an odd look already
                to the eyes of the "oldest inhabitants."</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">Many of our citizens, particularly those of Irish birth and descent, are looking for 
                the arrival in New York of Mr. Meagher,<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">9</a> the
                Repealer and Chartist. It is singular, though, that Mr. M. should have chosen just
                this occasion to withdraw himself, even briefly, from Ireland. If there be any truth
                in signs, or any determination in the Irish heart, the approaching fall will witness
                a violent struggle on the Emerald Isle—a struggle where every patriot should <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">be</span> and
                <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">act</span>, God defend the right, when the struggle comes!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Rumors of the potato rot are
                appearing in the papers. Among the other places mentioned as subject to this
                vegetable malady, is Long Island; but I think I can put this down as an error—for I
                have lately travelled nearly the whole length of Long Island, and have heard nothing
                about the potato rot.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">New York is getting to be more and more disagreeable and
                unhealthy, for residence. Even in the early morning, the effluvia from the gutters
                can hardly be borne. The paving stones get so heated through during the day, that
                they do not "cool off" again till next morning. It is a great deal worse, here than
                in New Orleans. I never was so annoyed there either by heat or by the exhalations.
                Let your citizens believe me, when I tell them seriously that the city of New
                Orleans is one of the healthiest locations in the land—Yellow Jack<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">10</a> to the contrary
                notwithstanding.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All over our Northern cities great preparations have been made (as
                is but just) for the complimentary reception of the returned soldiers—those of them
                who <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have</span> returned. In the cases of many of them, however, the actual necessaries of
                comfort, such as clothing, etc., are more needed by the volunteers, than any empty
                glorification. Still it argues well of the public spirit of the citizens that they
                offer these courtesies. We all have part in the immortal glory won by our troops in
                that Mexican war; and it will do us good, more ways than one for many a year yet.
                Among the rest of the returned volunteers are several of our New York printers.
                Right glad are we to welcome them back again, safe and sound.</p>

                    Party opposed the expansion of slavery into the territories of the western United States,
                 which included the territory that Mexico had ceded to the United States
                 in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War. When neither the 
                 Democratic nor the Republican party presidential nominees would rule out the expansion of slavery
                 into these territories, the Free Soil Party was formed in response. The Free Soil
                Party was active for six years, from 1848 to 1854. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n11">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00989_n11 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="med.00989_n11"><span>Martin Van Buren (1782–1862) was the eighth president of the United
                States, serving from 1837 to 1841. Whig candidate William Henry Harrison
                defeated the incumbent Van Buren in the 1840 election to become the ninth
                president of the United States. Van Buren later became an anti-slavery leader and 
                was the Free Soil candidate for president in the 1848 election; the Whig Candidate Zachary Taylor
                (1784–1850) defeated Van Buren and went on to serve as the twelfth president of the United States. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00950_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00950_n1"><span>Barnburners and Hunkers were terms used to describe 
                    opposing sides of the fracturing Democratic party in New York during the mid-nineteenth century. 
                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
                    reflected the national divisions that would lead to the American Civil War (1861–1865). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00954_n3 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00954_n3"><span>Martin Grover (1811–1875)

                    and as Secretary of State under James Buchanan. In 1848 he was the Democratic candidate for president. Cass was a 
                    proponent of the Doctrine of Popular Sovereignty, which held that each territory should choose whether to 
                    permit slavery. Cass was also crucial in the implementation of Andrew Jackson's policy of Indian Removal. For
