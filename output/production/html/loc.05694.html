            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your gratifying letter of the 25th instant was received last evening. I return the proof herewith. The only corrections I have
                seen to make are—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I. Striking out the quotation marks from the declaration of Novalis, which I think
                was without the quotation marks in the Tribune. I never meant to attribute <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">those words</span>—"the body is the temple of the Holy
                Ghost"—to Novalis, but only to indicate in that phrase
                the sense of what he says. The <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">phrase</span> is St.

                Paul's (I
                Corinthians, Chap. VI, verse 19) and I think it happily expresses, in epigrammatic
                form, what Novalis says very grandly, at length, in one of his "Fragments." When I get
                back to Washington, I will get the German book out of the Congressional Library (it
                has never been translated) and send you a version of some of his splendid sentences;
                and when I collect my letters into a pamphlet, as I still mean to (much work and
                    Jeannie's illness having prevented) I think I shall
                put in a note to the passage about Novalis, giving these sentences, lest some one
                should accuse me of having made the bull of attributing to von Hardenberg what
                belongs to Paul.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">II. "The poet, using <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nuptial</span>
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03280.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                imagery, as Isaiah, as Ezekiel," etc. I have changed
                this to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">sexual</span> imagery, which is truer to the fact as regards
                Isaiah and Ezekiel. The word "nuptial" was not well chosen originally.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">III. I have put in a row of stars (x x x x) to indicate a break in the extracts. You
                can strike them out, if you choose, for I don't stick on them, but they seem
                justified.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">That is all. The extracts pleased me greatly. They never seemed less <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">mine</span> than when I
                read them in this proof, nor ever before so powerful. If ever lightning went into
                sentences, it is these—although I say it, as shouldn't! That <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span>

                letter did good to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of Grass</span>, and I hope so much of it as is given here (in Bucke's book) will continue to do good. Dick Spofford told me Oliver Stevens felt
                "perfectly withered" when he read it. Apropos, he told me that his wife, Harriet
                Prescott Spofford, says always and everywhere, that you
                are the only poet that ever lived, who has done justice to women.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have drawn a mark and made a ? beside the passage in which Bucke eulogizes me, just to make you consider it. I read it with deep mental
                acknowledgments to him, but not without some misgivings. Still, it is his tribute,
                and it is not for me to make objections. I only wish to consider <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span> interests, 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03280.005.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.005.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                and should deprecate the introduction of any express
                statement, which might challenge successful attack by our enemies. I doubt the truth
                of the statement that I am "a scholar." Alas! I am not,
                and have had many a moment of bitter sorrow because I am not—because I have
                never had the chance to be more than a somewhat omniverous and desultory reader. I
                am afraid, too, that the Doctor overstates my proficiency in Elizabethan letters. I
                have had some new insights, some novel views of those books; no more. However, you
                must judge of the effect of the passage. As I read it, my main thought was whether it
                would do good or harm, and I am still in dubiety on this question.</p>
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03280.006.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.006.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad I am to have a revise, for there is one brief correction I want to make,
                being afraid to let the passage stand as I have it. It is where I mention Bacon as
                loving to ride at night, uncovered, that he might feel "the spirit of the universe
                upon his brow." This is from an old note of mine, which I forgot to ascribe to its
                source, and am unable to verify, though I cannot see how I could have misstated the
                matter in my notation. The nearest I can come to it is Aubrey's gossip that he loved
                to ride, uncovered, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in the spring rains</span>, that he might feel
                upon him "the universal spirit of the world"—a magnificent anecdote, I think,
                and 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03280.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03280.007.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                quite in keeping with the Shakespeare ideal (isn't it?), but not quite like my
                version; and I must alter the latter accordingly, for we are going to run a sweet
                gauntlet of criticism, and must not be laid open any more than can be helped.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Shouldn't wonder if the book, and especially my share in it, would make an enormous
                    row!</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The title page is very handsome, and the Lucretian motto delights my soul. I only
                wish a good <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">prose</span> translation of the lines (Munro's would do) could be slipped in
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">somewhere</span> in the book, for probably it is better to have
                the Latin alone on the title-page. I have no doubt, as you suggest, that I shall
                like the book typographically and every other way.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Today is the day set for Heywood's trial, and cold shivers run
                over me as I think of it. I can't help some sympathy for the devilish fool, despite
                the mischief he is likely to do us. Dr. Channing and I
                have concocted a move toward getting a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nolle pros</span>, though
                with small hope of success. In case of conviction, I mean to attempt, with Ashton's
                help, to get him promptly pardoned, which will break the force of the finding, and
                paralyze Comstock in his designs against your book. I am horribly anxious. Heywood is a stupendous jackass,
                and has contrived to render almost nugatory the clean victory we won by the Tribune
                letters. It is too bad.</p>
