                    April 10 and April 15, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated this letter April 12,
                    1873, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:213, n. 63; 370). The letter may date April 12, but the date
                    can only be established to within a range of a few days. Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's letter instructs Walt Whitman that he need not direct letters to
                    George Washington Whitman's office. Walt in his next letter asked, almost
                    certainly in response to this request, whether the new address that he used was
                    correct (see his <a href="yal.00414">April 16, 1873</a> letter to Louisa).
                    Walt's letter does not establish April 12 as the definite date for this letter,
                    but a few days before April 16, 1873 is consistent with Louisa's earlier report
                    that George's wife Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, who was believed pregnant, had not
                    come down the stairs for several days. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote in her
                        <a href="duk.00624">April 8, 1873</a> letter to Walt that "she dident
                    come down stairs all day monday)." Louisa wrote in this letter that her
                    daughter-in-law has not come down stairs "since last tuesday." The two letters,
                    taken together, place Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman upstairs without coming down
                    from Monday or Tuesday (April 7 or 8) through the date of this letter. The range
                    of dates for this letter is thus no earlier than April 10 and no later than
                    April 15. Bucke's date April 12 falls near the midpoint of the range and may be
                    derived from an envelope or other external marking, so it has the highest
                    probability among the range of dates. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
                    mother until her death. His brother George Washington Whitman cared for him for
                    most of the rest of his life, with financial support from Walt Whitman. Walt
