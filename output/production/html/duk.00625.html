                </span>
            </span>
            
            <p class="tei_p">i have just receeved your letter
            this stormy morning with the dollar in sometimes
            i want a little change but dont send it only
            once in a while) i have thought walter dear
            that you must have had more expence since
            you have been sick than you had before
            but there dont seem to be any consideration
                edds board
                is expected just the same</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">i have got the 2 other letters)
                you needent direct
            them to george and the foundry without you would
            rather as the letter man always brings them
            george is not there half of the time as he has work
                for mr Lane 
                at florence and glowcester
                he gets his
            8 dollars a day from the new york work) there is a large
            contract from boston given out to the gloster foundr<span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">y</span>
            george thinks he will get the inspecting of it
            it is about 4 miles from here so you see walt the more
            we have the more we want) i suppose if i 
            needed george would help me but he has never
            given me 50 cents since i have been heere</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i dont think but what i am welcome here from george
            Lou
                sometimes says when she and george was alone
            they got this and that but now theres so many</p>
            <p class="tei_p">a woman can doo very much to have a man think
            different from what things really is</p>

            <p class="tei_p">george is more changed in some respects than
                i could ever beleive he gives the strectest account
            of every thing and if he goes out you wont be gone
                more than 10 minutes it seemes so strange for him
            as he always went when he preased and come
            when he liked) aunt Lib as they call her is here
                and i gess will be here for some tim Lou says george
            likes to have her here i like her well enoughf i think
            likely she will make her home here) Lou hasent
            been down stairs since last tuesday till this
                morning
                george carried her down he carr<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">ies</span>
            her up and down then she goes out in the kichen</p>
            <p class="tei_p">god forgive me if i judge wrongfully but i dont
            think there is much the matter</p>
            <p class="tei_p">dear walt you mustent think i complain but
            i think if i had sombody to talk a little with i should
            feel releeved so i have to bother you with my
            gossip good bie walter dear you must write often
