                    (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
                    criticism on <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, titled "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/gilchrist/works/anc.02116.html">A Woman's Estimate

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
                    relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    intimated that his slow response rate to Anne was not indicative of any adverse
                    feelings towards her: "Many times during the past year, especially during the
                    past six months, have I thought of you &amp; your children—Many times
                    indeed have I been goign to write, but did not . . . Do not think hard of me for not
                    writing oftener, especially the last seven months—If you could look into
                    my spirit &amp; emotions you would be entirely satisfied &amp; at peace."
                    Moreover, Whitman informed Anne at the beginning of that same letter of August
                    18 that the "clouds have darkened over me," then described that since January of
                    that year he had lost his mother and sister, and had himself become
                    paralyzed. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02872_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02872_n3"><span>Whitman enclosed in his

                    ring: "The enclosed ring I have just taken from my finger &amp; send you with my
                    love." Although Whitman did not write again until 1875, he sent Gilchrist
                    newspapers and magazines. On <a href="loc.03649">November 3, 1873</a>, she
                    wrote about her children; and on <a href="loc.02873">December 18,
                    1873</a>, she said of his health: "Perhaps if my hand were in yours, dear
                    Walt, you would get along faster. Dearer and sweeter that lot than even to have
                    been your bride in the full flush &amp; strength and glory of your youth. I turn
