                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    as the "big book," was published by the poet himself—in an arrangement
                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span>—in December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made
                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    Bertz (1853–1931) sent Whitman an article he had published in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Deutsche Presse</span> of June 2 (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.82.html">Friday, June 28, 1889</a>). On July 2 Whitman sent Bertz <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span>, and on July 7 a copy of
                    Bucke's book (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
                    Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).
                    Bertz thanked the poet on <a href="loc.01096">July 20–22</a>; he
                    stated that he preferred Freiligrath's translations to those of Rolleston and
                    Knortz, and called attention to his own book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The French
                        Prisoners</span> (1884), "the story of a friendship between a German boy and a
                    young French soldier," with a chapter motto from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>. In 1905 Bertz published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman; ein
                        Charakterbild</span>, which candidly argued that Whitman was a (sexually
                    inactive) homosexual; the work generated one of the earliest public debates
                    about Whitman's sexuality. For more information on Bertz, see Grünzweig,
                    Walter, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_176.html">Bertz, Eduard (1853–1931)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
