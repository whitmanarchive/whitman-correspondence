                    <p class="tei_p">"Little Mitch," or Reuben Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during
                        the War and met Whitman in Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon
                        his release from the hospital he corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell
                        received his discharge on August 24, 1864, he returned to his home in
                        Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was renewed when Whitman
                        sent a postcard on February 5, 1875. On <a href="duk.00538">March 5,
                            1875</a>, Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear
                        old Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did
                        in the days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's
                        last letter, on <a href="duk.00539">August 16, 1875</a>, he said that
                        he was planning to leave shortly for California. He is mentioned in
                        "Memoranda During the War"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of
                            Walt Whitman</span>, ed. Richard Maurice Bucke, Thomas B. Harned, and
                        Horace L. Traubel (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902), 4:134. </p>
                    <p class="tei_p">The year is confirmed by the reference to Farwell's letter of <a href="duk.00538">March 5, 1875</a>. When Bucke wrote to Farwell
                        after Walt Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the
                        back of a circular," was extant.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
