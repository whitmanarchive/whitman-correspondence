            <p class="tei_p">Something that troubled Presidents Washington and
                Adams fifty years ago—an article called "Red Republicanism" now-a-days—has been
                paraded at Tammany Hall lately. I mean, of course, the meeting last Saturday night,
                to compliment Mr. Hecker,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> and listen to a speech from him and other ultra radicals.
                All day long the great folds of the flag of "gold, red and black," had been
                flaunting from the staff at the top of old Tammany, joined with our own
                "Star-Spangled;" and at night, the immense room was an absolute jam of human beings.
                The Socialists, National Reformers, and Free Soilers,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">2</a> gathered in great force; Old
                Hunkerism,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">3</a> and all sorts of Conservativism, looked on with a sour face, and
                retreated from the scene. It was a ga'a time for all the highest and most
                enthusiastic doctrines of "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!" I, too, caught the
                enthusiasm, and though I understand German about as much as Choctaw, found myself
                cheering the Herr as loudly as the rest. Ah! there is something in the breast that
                bursts all control, in responding on such occasions to high and lofty dreams of
                political perfection—the wish to stab all sorts of tyranny that have for so many
                ages enchained the physical and mental powers of the "lower orders" of human kind!
                The popular feeling in New York would, even now, receive such men as Rollin and
                Blanc<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">4</a> with joy. We do not so much wish their doctrines tried here in America, for we
                are doing well enough; and every successive ten years shows an opening still wider
                of radicalism—about as fast and as far as the people can stand it. But there is a
                deadly hatred toward the oppression and misery which the continent of Europe has
                received as its black legacy from the past. Devastation and blood seem horrible
                enough, but folks think they are not much worse than the wretchedness of stagnation,
                poverty, and death, for the millions of the old world.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Theatrical goers here and
                falling into the Macready<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> current with a looseness. It is singular—perhaps it might
                be called absurd—for Macready is little better than the "remains" of a good actor.
                The Literary World hits the truth of the thing in the following paragraph:</p> 
            
            
            <span class="inline_quote"><span class="tei_floatingText"><p class="tei_p">It seems
                to be a solemn engagement the American people have entered into with themselves, to
                fall into a frenzy or a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">furor</span>, at certain periodical intervals. Whatever object may
                happen to catch the current at its flood, is pretty sure to be borne on to fortune.
                At one time it is the domesticity of Miss Bremer,<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">6</a> then it is the diabolism of Sue,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">7</a>

                the very heel of a successful engagement of that "natural actor," Forrest,<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">9</a> we have
                the whirlwind raised to fill the sails of that great "artistic performer," Macready.
                Six months ago, Mr. Macready might have whistled for a hearing on the "merits"—six
                months hence his chances might be equally slender.</p></span></span>

                 in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo following the Mexican-American War. When neither the 
                 Democratic nor the Republican party presidential nominees would rule out the expansion of slavery
                 into these territories, the Free Soil Party was formed in response. The Free Soil
                Party was active for six years, from 1848 to 1854. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00950_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00950_n1"><span>Barnburners and Hunkers were terms used to describe

                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
