            <p class="tei_p">On Tuesday next, October 3d, the Fair of the American
                Institute (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">exhibition</span> of American manufacturers, is the proper phrase,) commences at
                Castle Garden. I stepped in yesterday afternoon, and made my way with difficulty
                through the vast confusion of articles that lie along the covered bridge, and the
                ample area inside. Time was when this exhibition produced good effects; but that
                time has gone by. Under the management of superannuated old men, wedded to the
                notions of the past, it is entirely behind time. This is a pity, too; because an
                institution of this sort is capable of doing much real benefit. It must strike
                higher though, than the aim of bringing together some large pumpkins, rich
                plum-cakes, and curiously patched bed-quilts.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">A new daily paper, to be called "The
                Drawing Room Journal," is on the eve of its appearance in this city; its editor is
                Mr. G. G. Foster. Book publishing languishes badly enough, about now. Harpers,
                Wiley, Putnam, Appleton, etc., now and then bring out a reprint; but all are waiting
                till after election before doing much in this way.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Towards sundown yesterday
                afternoon, Capt. Jas. Baker, of the ship Thomas H. Perkins, lying at one of our
                wharves, Narrowly escaped with his life from the hands of an infuriated mob, who
                seized him because he had shot and cut one of his crew, named Wm. Leonard. The
                latter was a sort of rival to the Captain, in the good graces of a female steerage
                passenger. He went, yesterday, in the cabin for his pay; was ordered out;
                altercation arose, and the Captain ran for a pistol and cutlass, and shot and cut
                Leonard so that his life is despaired of. A mob rapidly collected, and were so
                incensed that they dragged, cuffed, and bruised Baker pretty severely. The police
                came down in force, and, partly by stratagem, and partly by force, carried the
                Captain off to the Tombs, where he is at present locked up. The public mind here in
                New York is highly incensed, of late, against the cruelty of marine officers. There
                is a plentiful dash of Jacobianism among the "common people," which breaks out,
                sometimes a little too hastily perhaps, against those in authority. Jacobianism is
                far, far, far better though than the lethargic cowardice which will let a whole
                people stagnate in mean submission to any sort of tyranny.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">John S. Austin, well
                known as a prominent member of the Empire Club, was arrested last night, charged
                with the murder of a young man named Timothy Shea. The affair occurred in a low
                place in Leonard street.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Postmasters, Customhouse officers, and other United States
                officials, are being removed pretty extensively in this State; causeâ€”adhesion
                to Van Buren instead of Cass and Butler. The 
                Customhouse and Naval office were
                closed yesterday, in respect to Mr. Hoffman, deceased.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I confess plumply to have
                made a blunder in predicting the nomination of Walworth by the anti-renters. It
                appears that they have nominated John A. Dix, the Barnburner candidate 
                for Governor.
                This is somewhat remarkable, for Dix was understood to stand by Gov. Wright in his
                anti-rent measures.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">The Odd Fellows of this State seems to be getting up a little
                bit of a row among themselves. What it is about I must confess I do not exactly
                understand. The Lodges of the Oneida District have resolved not to submit to a
                certain important decision of the Grand Lodge of the United States. Very likely you
                know more about it than I do.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Greeley comes out in this morning's Tribune with the
                regular whig ticket flying at the head of his paper. His leader, attempting to
                fortify his course, is lame and impotent. Still, time remains for him to plaster the
                flaws up, pretty well, before the election. Undoubtedly these defections from the
                Free Soil ticket will reduce its vote considerably. The whigs hold a grand pow-wow
                at Vauxhall this evening, to clinch the "harmonizing" of the elements, and the
                return of the various prodigal sons. Leslie Coombs is to speak. Both whig and
                democratic (Cass) meetings, thus far, have had the worst speaking that has marked
                any political campaign within my remembrance. Every body acknowledges that the
                orators and the addresses are positively shocking.</p>
