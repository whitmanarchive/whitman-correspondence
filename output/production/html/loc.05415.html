         <p class="tei_p">Your letter was received this morning, I was glad that you arrived safely in Washington.
            After I left you on Monday, I went to see the young lady, that I spoke to you of, that
            had been to Atlantic City, and I asked her, what kind of a place it was to have a quiet,
            nice time, and she said very good, that the Doctors house was the nearest the ocean, and that there would be a good walk to the
            beach from the house this year, and there is always a good 
               breeze, and she said that if you had a room <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01408_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_gk.01408_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_gk.01408_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc_gk.01408_large.jpg</span> fronting the ocean it was splendid. They
            go down the middle of June.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I rather think you would like it. As for coming to Camden, come right away if you can,
            plenty of room you know, and no doubt we will get enough to eat Aunt Libbie went away
            this morning. I had a letter from Mary to day, she wanted to know more about Mamy's death, I am going to write very soon to both Hannah and her, I have not found
            time yet to write all that I want to say, that is a satisfactory letter to them.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">We had a line from Jeff</p>
         <p class="tei_p">George is well and busy</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Hope this will find you

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
