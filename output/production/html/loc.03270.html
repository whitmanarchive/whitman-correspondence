            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter but had been looking into the matter for some days previously,
                Dr. Bucke<a href="#n0119" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0119">1</a> and Mr. Johnston<a href="#n0336" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0336">2</a>  
                having spoken to me about your claim
                against Worthingon.<a href="#n1053" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1053">3</a> The difficulty I find <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">is​ </span></span> this that <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">R.Worthington​ </span></span> failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own name,
                and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of which
                Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time within which
                to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run out and we are
                therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I am therefore
                quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the "Worthington Co." has been
                doing with reference to your book. The Company is of some responsibility and
                undoubtedly have possession of the plates.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As soon as I have facts sufficient to base a sure claim I will get the injunction and
                money.</p>

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin

                    first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
                    [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>).
