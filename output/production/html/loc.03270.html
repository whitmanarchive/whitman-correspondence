            </span> 
            <p class="tei_p">I received your letter but had been looking into the matter for some days previously,
                Dr. Bucke and Mr. Johnston  
                having spoken to me about your claim
                against Worthingon. The difficulty I find <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">is​ </span><span class="tei_corr">in​
        
      </span></span> this that <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">R.Worthington​ </span><span class="tei_corr">R. Worthington​
        
      </span></span> failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own name,
                and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of which
                Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time within which
                to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run out and we are
                therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I am therefore
                quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the "Worthington Co." has been
                doing with reference to your book. The Company is of some responsibility and
                undoubtedly have possession of the plates.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">As soon as I have facts sufficient to base a sure claim I will get the injunction and
                money.</p>
