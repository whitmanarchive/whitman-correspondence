                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    "the venerable poet spoke at length concerning his poetry, and in the course of
                    his address repeated extracts, among which were 'The Mysterious Trumpeter' and
                    'Two Birds' in 'Pauman Oak'" ["The Mystic Trumpeter" and the section beginning
                    "Once Paumanok . . ." from "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"]. The meeting
                    was attended by Traubel and Dr. Daniel G. Brinton, a professor at the University
                    of Pennsylvania, who on <a href="loc.06061">February 28</a> formally
                    conveyed to Walt Whitman the gratitude of the club. According to Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), he received $20 for
                    the reading. See Traubel's account in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re Walt Whitman</span>
