                    and in 1891.

                    Daintrey has in mind; perhaps she has confused Whitman with John Greenleaf

                    from Frederick, Maryland, who waved the Stars and Stripes while General Lee's
                    and Stonewall Jackson's rebel troops marched by her window, as "Bravest of all
