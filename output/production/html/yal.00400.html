            <p class="tei_p">Your kind letter came duly to hand. I have been delaying to write you about the portrait in answer—wanting <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">you</span> to do it—&amp; wanting, if I could arrange it, to give you the full price—I will not have the job done by any second-rater, &amp; have concluded to give it up for the present—unless it could be done by you for $50, which, I am fully aware, would not be your due engagement.</p>
                       
            
              <p class="tei_p">I return to Washington in ten or twelve days. Is there any chance of your coming on there?</p>
