                    (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
                    1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
                    Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
                    others, wrote the "indispensable" <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of Wood-Engraving in

                        1776–1876</span> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
                    poems as well as his picture. According to his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Threescore and
                        Ten Years, 1820 to 1890—Recollections</span> (1894), 216–217,
                    Linton met with Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which
                    Whitman reported in his <a href="loc.01621">November 9, 1873</a>, letter
                    to Peter Doyle): "I liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big
                    fellow, . . . a true poet who could not write poetry, much of wilfulness accounting for his neglect of form." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_yal.00400_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="yal.00400_n2"><span>Linton's engraving
