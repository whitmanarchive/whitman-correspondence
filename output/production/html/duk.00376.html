            <p class="tei_p">Because my being so negligent of course I supposed you would act
the same to me</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Last week I was sick so that the house was obliged to hold me very tight  It is kind of a curious thing for me. I can not go out in to the open air with out taking cold</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps you will call at Armory Square when in Washington. I have been thinking about going there this winter to wile a way some of these lonesome days</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My Folks have some objections to my going where I have been so often for the last three years. But there is nothing like geting used to a thing or too</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The least stormy weather here drives us in to the houseâ€”But the rainyest night on Picket in Virginia we had to stand any how. Even a snow storme or too we have had here then I thought about being by the side of a snug fire all curdleed up in a little heap half froze to death</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A good warme bed a fellow gets at home besides other fixens throwed in. I hardly evr thought of these when I Enlisted &amp; perhaps I may try the self same opperations again. This is a curious world to live &amp; sport in   There will be no Young ladies after this war closes.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Because they are a fraid some of the loved ones will come home crippled &amp; they will Marry while they think about it  Mostly of the Softer Sex will be old Maids waiting so long. I presume some of them are tired</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Yes I will tell her all about you one of these times &amp; that before she is Married which wont be a great while. Well Uncle I hope this may find you still alive &amp; well</p>

                    Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the war and met Whitman in
                    Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
                    corresponded with him. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24, 1864,
                    he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was
                    renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On March 5, 1875,
                    Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I
                    would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore.
                    what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on August 16,
                    1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California. Eleven
                    letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection at Duke University. He is also
                    mentioned in Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Memoranda During War</span>; Richard
                    Maurice Bucke, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</span>
                    [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134. The year is confirmed by the
                    reference to Farwell's letter of March 5, 1875 (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana,
                    Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). (For
