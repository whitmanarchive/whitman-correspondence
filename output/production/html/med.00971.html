            <p class="tei_p">There is a fair probability of the "malignants" of the
                whig party here coming into subjection soon, under the banner of Taylorism. 
                Mr. N. B. Blunt has followed David Graham, and, though 
                no one knows exactly "who's the next customer," it wouldn't be very surprising if it were Mr. Greeley himself. His paper
                has had an unusual squinting that way of late. The separate nominations for State
                officers by the whigs, hunkers and barnburners have exercised considerable influence
                toward re-marking distinct lines between the parties. Then there is the great
                probability of Fish's election, and whig success in the Legislature, which will
                result in some hundreds of appointments. The latter facts have contributed very much
                toward a general "harmonizing" of the whigs. The Clay men have a meeting at Vauxhall
                to-night, whereat the fiery and eloquent Virginian, John M. Botts, is to hold forth.
                It will doubtless be serviceable in letting the said Clay men drop gracefully into
                the open and expectant arms of Taylorism. Probably, however, as much mischief has
                already been done as could be done, on this point. Those among the masses who have
                been carried over from the whigs to "free soil" cannot easily be recaptured.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">John
                Van Buren is roaming around through the interior of the State. During the last days
                of last week he addressed large meetings at Herkimer and Utica. All accounts agree
                in stating that Van Buren divides the western and interior parts of the State with
                Taylor. In those parts, Gen. Cass may be emphatically said to be "nowhere." In the
                eastern regions, in Kings county, and in two or three other counties, he does much
                better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Capt. Bertrand and Mr. Watson, of 
                the ship Alhambra, (for Antwerp, but put
                in here) whose case, under charge of murder by flogging a seaman, was detailed in
                one of my late letters, yet remain in prison here. The bail of Capt. B. has been
                fixed at $2500</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Green, the ex-gambler, is again lecturing in town. He exhibits, at
                these lectures, some curious diagrams and tricks—quite sufficient to astonish such
                unsophisticated ones as your humble servant.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Bishop Onderdonk's case is again to
                come up before the Annual Episcopal Convention, which convenes at St. John's Church
                to-morrow. His friends are trying to move heaven and earth (particular earth) for a
                revocation of the sentence on the amorous Bishop, and a general white-washing of his
                character.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Theatricals are prospering better now than erewhile. At the Park, which
                was miserably attended for the first fortnight after its opening, the manager has
                brought out "Esmeralda," the Monplaisirs, Miss Bulan 
                and Corby doing the leading
                characters. The piece has a good run, and still attracts fair audiences. At the
                Bowery, last night, Mr. Hamblin appeared as Hamlet, with Miss Mary Taylor as
                Ophelia! Forty years ago, Hamblin could have done justice to this sublimest drama in
                the language; he never can any more. Miss Taylor is shockingly out of place as a
                tragedy queen. Her voice is pleasing, but she cannot even begin to exhibit the
                beauties which "Shakspeare drew" of the love-sick daughter of old Polonius. Forrest 
                played all last week at the Broadway to crowded and applauding houses. Mr. Collins 
                commenced, last night, at the same place, a round of Irish characters. He is very
                popular, and really plays better than any Irish comedian at present among us. At the
                National, "Mose" and "Captain Tobin" continue to attract. That was a capital idea of
                Chanfrau's (or somebody else's), in carrying out an original representation of the
                New York rowdy and "b'hoy." It wouldn't be bad if the originality were extended
                farther and wider. Placide, Sefton and 
                Vanderhoff are enacting "London
                Assurance"—that flippant production—at Niblo's, Astor Place. Mmlle. Adelaide Lehmann 
                and Charles Winther  glide, leap and hop through the "Sylphide," at Burton's, in
                Chambers street; and there are are concerts, and picture exhibitions, and panoramas,
                and dioramas, and all sorts of negro minstrels with twenty other kinds of
                amusements, good, bad and indifferent....The Acadia brought over Macready and Mrs.
                G. Barrett,  who will probably play together. It is not known positively, but it is
                expected they will appear at the Park. Whichever house they don't play in should
                forthwith checkmate them by engaging Charlotte Cushman,  who has more real genius
                than all the foreign actors that have come to us since the time of Edmund Kean and
                George F. Cooke.  A plan is in operation for a grand benefit to the family of Mr.
                Simpson;  it will come off the ensuing month.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I see that the Crescent City leaves
                here on the 2d of October, and is advertised to sail hence again on the 30th of the
                same month. The new steamer Falcon, Capt. W. T. Thompson, leaves for New Orleans—via
                Havana, same as the Crescent City—on the 16th of October; passage $75 and $60. The
                U.S. mail steam-packet California, to San Francisco and Astoria, and intermediate
                ports, leaves on the 2d of October.</p>
