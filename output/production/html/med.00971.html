            <p class="tei_p">There is a fair probability of the "malignants" of the
                whig party here coming into subjection soon, under the banner of Taylorism.<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">1</a> 
                Mr. N. B. Blunt<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> has followed David Graham,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> and, though 
                no one knows exactly "who's the next customer," it wouldn't be very surprising if it were Mr. Greeley<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">4</a> himself. His paper
                has had an unusual squinting that way of late. The separate nominations for State
                officers by the whigs,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">5</a> hunkers and barnburners<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">6</a> have exercised considerable influence
                toward re-marking distinct lines between the parties. Then there is the great
                probability of Fish's<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">7</a> election, and whig success in the Legislature, which will
                result in some hundreds of appointments. The latter facts have contributed very much
                toward a general "harmonizing" of the whigs. The Clay<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a> men have a meeting at Vauxhall
                to-night, whereat the fiery and eloquent Virginian, John M. Botts,<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">9</a> is to hold forth.
                It will doubtless be serviceable in letting the said Clay men drop gracefully into
                the open and expectant arms of Taylorism. Probably, however, as much mischief has
                already been done as could be done, on this point. Those among the masses who have
                been carried over from the whigs to "free soil" cannot easily be recaptured.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">John
                Van Buren<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">10</a> is roaming around through the interior of the State. During the last days
                of last week he addressed large meetings at Herkimer and Utica. All accounts agree
                in stating that Van Buren divides the western and interior parts of the State with
                Taylor. In those parts, Gen. Cass<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">11</a> may be emphatically said to be "nowhere." In the
                eastern regions, in Kings county, and in two or three other counties, he does much
                better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Capt. Bertrand<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">12</a> and Mr. Watson,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">13</a> of 
                the ship Alhambra, (for Antwerp, but put
                in here) whose case, under charge of murder by flogging a seaman, was detailed in
                one of my late letters, yet remain in prison here. The bail of Capt. B. has been
                fixed at $2500</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Green, the ex-gambler,<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">14</a> is again lecturing in town. He exhibits, at
                these lectures, some curious diagrams and tricks—quite sufficient to astonish such
                unsophisticated ones as your humble servant.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Bishop Onderdonk's<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">15</a> case is again to
                come up before the Annual Episcopal Convention, which convenes at St. John's Church
                to-morrow. His friends are trying to move heaven and earth (particular earth) for a
                revocation of the sentence on the amorous Bishop, and a general white-washing of his
                character.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Theatricals are prospering better now than erewhile. At the Park, which
                was miserably attended for the first fortnight after its opening, the manager has
                brought out "Esmeralda," the Monplaisirs,<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">16</a> Miss Bulan<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">17</a> 
                and Corby<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">18</a> doing the leading
                characters. The piece has a good run, and still attracts fair audiences. At the
                Bowery, last night, Mr. Hamblin<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">19</a> appeared as Hamlet, with Miss Mary Taylor<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">20</a> as
                Ophelia! Forty years ago, Hamblin could have done justice to this sublimest drama in
                the language; he never can any more. Miss Taylor is shockingly out of place as a
                tragedy queen. Her voice is pleasing, but she cannot even begin to exhibit the
                beauties which "Shakspeare drew" of the love-sick daughter of old Polonius. Forrest<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">21</a> 
                played all last week at the Broadway to crowded and applauding houses. Mr. Collins<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">22</a> 
                commenced, last night, at the same place, a round of Irish characters. He is very
                popular, and really plays better than any Irish comedian at present among us. At the
                National, "Mose" and "Captain Tobin" continue to attract. That was a capital idea of
                Chanfrau's<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">23</a> (or somebody else's), in carrying out an original representation of the
                New York rowdy and "b'hoy." It wouldn't be bad if the originality were extended
                farther and wider. Placide,<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">24</a> Sefton<a href="#n16" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r16">25</a> and

                Assurance"—that flippant production—at Niblo's, Astor Place. Mmlle. Adelaide Lehmann<a href="#n22" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r22">27</a> 
                and Charles Winther<a href="#n20" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r20">28</a>  glide, leap and hop through the "Sylphide," at Burton's, in
                Chambers street; and there are are concerts, and picture exhibitions, and panoramas,
                and dioramas, and all sorts of negro minstrels with twenty other kinds of
                amusements, good, bad and indifferent....The Acadia brought over Macready<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">29</a> and Mrs.
                G. Barrett,<a href="#n21" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r21">30</a>  who will probably play together. It is not known positively, but it is
                expected they will appear at the Park. Whichever house they don't play in should
                forthwith checkmate them by engaging Charlotte Cushman,<a href="#n19" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r19">31</a>  who has more real genius

                party in the antebellum United States; the Whig and the Democratic Parties
                were the two major political parties in the United States as part of the two-party system.
                The Whigs were critical of the nation's expansion into Texas and of the Mexican-American War and favored a national bank. 
                They preferred that Congress take the lead in lawmaking and opposed strong presidential power. Their
                supporters were primarily professionals and social reformers; they received much less
                support from farmers and laborers. The Democratic Party in this period
                opposed a national bank, and they advocated for strong presidential power,
                and the interests of slave states. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_med.00950_n1 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="med.00950_n1"><span>Barnburners and Hunkers were terms used to describe

                    The Barnburners held radical anti-slavery views and were willing to destroy banks and corporations
                    to end corruption and abuses. The Hunkers were pro-government; they favored state
                    banks and minimized the issue of slavery. The divisions between these factions in New York
