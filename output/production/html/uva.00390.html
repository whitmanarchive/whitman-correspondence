                    Commonplace Book, Whitman sent a note on December 12 to George W. Childs
                    (1824–1894), co-owner of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Philadelphia Public
                        Ledger</span>, and on December 17, he received "50 from G W C for the drivers'
                    gloves" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). At Christmas, Whitman
                    sent gloves to friends, relatives, and various drivers. He apparently had enough
                    gloves to give them as presents again in 1881. This draft letter appears on the
                    verso of notes for "A County Auction." </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
