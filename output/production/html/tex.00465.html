            <p class="tei_p">I tried to intercept 
                you on your return 
                from Boston in April.
                I was in N.Y. three or 
                four days from April 18, 
                but found you did not 
                stop. I was greatly pleased 
                over the success of the 
                Boston affair, &amp; over 
                your account of it in 
                the Critic. I am

                thinking about running 
                down to see you, &amp; would 
                like to know if I will 
                find you at Camden 
                for the next week or two. 
            Ursula came home from 
                the Hospital early in April 
                in a very bad way—worse 
                than when she went there. 
                We went out to Roxbury
                &amp; stayed there 3 or 4 weeks
                We are now back home 
                for part of the summer 
                at least. She is much 
                better now—in fact seems 
                better than she has done

                for a year or two. Julian 
                is well &amp; grows finely. It 
                has been my plan to have 
                you up here for the summer 
                if I could pursuade you 
                to come, But things do 
                not work right. I have 
                saved &amp; partly furnished a 
                large room for you in 
                the other house, but the 
                woman in the other part 
                whom I depended on to look 
                after you has been sick 
                for two months &amp; we begin 
                to fear she will not get 
                well. What are your

                plans for the summer, &amp; 
                could you come if things 
                take a favorable turn? 
            I receive papers from you 
                frequently. I sent you a 
                copy of "Pepacton" which 
                no doubt you recd 
                R.H. Stoddard in the "Evening 
                Maid" (Myron Benton says 
                it is he) vents his speen 
                upon it—takes nearly a
                column to condemn it &amp; 
                all that kind of literature.
             But little do I care. I have 
                always had my opinion of 
                him.
