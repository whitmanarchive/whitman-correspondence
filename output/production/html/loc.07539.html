            <p class="tei_p">Had fine weather to-day. Much as usual with me—An elderly gentleman, an
               Iowan just ret'g from Eng[land], told me at a dining
               party at Rossetti's a Frenchman told him of a review of L of G.
               ab't three or four months ago in Paris—the gent. said he could give me the
               date &amp; name of magazine &amp; if so I will tell you—Your letter came last
               evn'g—Have had beef &amp; onions for my dinner—Ate with
               relish—</p>
