                    <p class="tei_p">Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro (1808–1875?) came to the U.S. from Ireland as
                        a young man. He edited a newspaper in New York and later had a brief career
                        on the stage. Subsequently he was a translator for the State Department and
                        a lecturer. He was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Random Shots and Southern
                            Breezes</span> (New York: Harper and Brothers, 1842) and translator of
                        Louis-Phillipe-Albert d'Orléans, Compte de Paris' <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">History of the Civil War in America</span> (Philadelphia: J. H. Coates,
                        1875). On April 26, 1872, Whitman inserted in the Washington <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Morning Chronicle</span> an appeal for "pecuniary
                        assistance for a man of genius," who was not named. On the following day the
                            <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chronicle</span> noted "prompt contributions" from,
                        among others, Samuel Ward.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                        1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., there are three
                        receipts written by Whitman and signed by Tasistro. On April 26, 1872,
                        Tasistro acknowledged $70. On April 29, 1872, he accepted an additional
                        $25, and on May 14, 1872, $10. On August 3, 1872, in his own hand,
                        Tasistro signed a receipt for $17. On the verso Whitman noted the total
                        of $122: "also $10 more handed by W. W. to Mr. Tasistro." On October
                        24, 1872, Walt Whitman wrote: "also about $25 more in different sums
                        since." See <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman Review</span>, 7 (1961),
