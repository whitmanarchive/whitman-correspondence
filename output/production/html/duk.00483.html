            <p class="tei_p">Han has been as it were failing day. Dr 
                Binghman is assiduous in his endeavor to arrest the disease, which is jaundice,
                and has succeeded—yet she is very weak—still can walk about 
                and attend to domestic affairs, for herself. She thinks
                that the Dr may not be assured of getting his pay. He
                has a very his opinion of you, and should you write to him, giving him some
                assurance, it would gratify him greatly. I have had a contribution twice of 5 dollars, 
                which is absorbed in provisions. Han wants many
                little luxuries. Great surprise is manifested that her sister in law (Lou) 
                does not make her a visit—or send funds.
