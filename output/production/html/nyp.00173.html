                    father of Jesse Mullery. According to Whitman's "Hospital Book 12" (Feinberg
                    Collection, Library of Congress), Sergeant Jesse Mullery, Company K, Fifteenth
                    New Jersey, was in Ward A, Armory Square Hospital, on May 14, 1864. The
                    twenty-year-old boy had been "shot through shoulder, ball in lung—(ball
                    still probably near lung)—lost right finger." On June 23, 1864, he went
                    home to Vernon, New Jersey, on furlough, and then served as assistant cook in
                    the army hospital in Newark. On December 26, 1864, Mullery proposed a visit to
                    Brooklyn. He was still at the Newark hospital on January 23, 1865. According to
                    his letters of <a href="nyp.00178">May 3, 1865</a>, and <a href="nyp.00179">June 11, 1865</a>, he later was able to return to
                    active duty. </span></span> [<a href="#r100">back</a>]</li></ul>
