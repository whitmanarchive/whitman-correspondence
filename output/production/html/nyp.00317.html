            <p class="tei_p">I will commence a letter to you, though there is nothing particular to write
                about—but it is a pleasure even to write—as I am alone a great deal yet
                in my room. It is about ½ past 8, and I am sitting here alone—I have been out
                to-day twice, riding in the cars—it is a change—the weather here is very
                pleasant indeed—if I could only get around,<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">1</a> I

            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I am now finishing my letter, over at the office seated at my
                desk—I do not feel very well. My head is still so feeble—I suppose I
                ought to be satisfied that I do not go behindhand—I send you quite a bundle of
                papers to-day—One of the Graphics<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> with one of my

                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in
                    his <a href="yal.00260">January 26, 1873</a>, letter to his mother, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
