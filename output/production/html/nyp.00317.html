            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I will commence a letter to you, though there is nothing particular to write
                about—but it is a pleasure even to write—as I am alone a great deal yet
                in my room. It is about ½ past 8, and I am sitting here alone—I have been out
                to-day twice, riding in the cars—it is a change—the weather here is very
                pleasant indeed—if I could only get around, I
                should be satisfied— </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I expect Peter Doyle in yet this evening, to stay an hour or
                two—he works every night except Sunday night—</p>
            <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1873-04-07">Monday noon | April 7</span>.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother dear, I am now finishing my letter, over at the office seated at my
                desk—I do not feel very well. My head is still so feeble—I suppose I
                ought to be satisfied that I do not go behindhand—I send you quite a bundle of
                papers to-day—One of the Graphics with one of my
                pieces in—the spring seems to be opening here, the grass
                is quite green, &amp; the trees are beginning to bud out—it looks very
                pleasant— </p>
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, mama dear, &amp; all—</span>
