                    was born in Brooklyn; he was the son of William Wise (1814–1903)
                    and Amanda Wise (1818–1891). Alfred's father William was a jeweler for more than
                    seventy years; the Wise's firm was the pioneer jewelry house in Brooklyn 
                    when it was founded in 1834 ("Alfred F. Wise, Well Known Jeweler Dies," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Brooklyn Daily Times</span>, July 12, 1924, 2). 
                    Alfred became a partner in his father's jewelry business in the
                    1850s, at which time the business was renamed William Wise &amp; Son. William
                    and Alfred Wise are listed in the Brooklyn Directory for 1866–1867 as
                    living at 233 Fulton St., Brooklyn (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notebooks and Unpublished

                    Press, 1984], 2:837). According to United States census records, Alfred worked first as a dealer in watches and, later,
                    was listed as a retail jeweler and merchant. He was married to Mabel 
                    Alden Bunker (1862–1956); the couple did not have any children. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n0785">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0785 note" id="n0785"><span>In the presidential election of 1868, Republican candidate General Ulysses S. Grant defeated Democratic nominee Horatio 
                    Seymour with a 214–80 electoral advantage (Grant received 400,000 more popular votes); incumbent Andrew Johnson did not receive the Democratic Party's
                    nomination after his impeachment and general unpopularity while in office. The
                    race was marked by a close popular vote, although Grant's success as a Union
                    general during the Civil War is widely acknowledged as significant to his
                    presidential victory. After Pennsylvania went Republican in the elections held

                    Confederate General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox. Grant was elected to two
                    consecutive terms as president, first in 1868 and again in 1872. </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
