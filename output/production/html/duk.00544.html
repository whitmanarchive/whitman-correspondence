                        Thursday in May 1868. Neither Walt Whitman's reply to this letter, nor any
                        letter to his mother between his <a href="upa.00159">April 28–May
                            4, 1868</a> and his <a href="duk.00650">June 6–8, 1868</a>
                        letters survive. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to May 14, 1868, but
                        this date cannot be directly confirmed. Nonetheless, Clarence Gohdes and
                        Rollo G. Silver accepted Bucke's date (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp;

                        North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 195–196), and Edwin
                        Haviland Miller cited their date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                        1961–77], 1:374). The date, nonetheless, remains uncertain.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p"> May 14 fell on Thursday in 1868, but the letter may date to a Thursday that
                        preceded or followed in the same month. May seems to be consistent with the
                        efforts of Jane McClure (Louisa's "maquire") to remove Andrew Jackson
                        Whitman's children from the care of his widow Nancy McClure and place them
                        in an orphan asylum, a topic to which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman returned in
                        her <a href="duk.00545">June 25, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman. Jane
                        McClure was the sister-in-law of Nancy. Louisa wrote in late June that Jane
                        McClure inquired whether "cornell had been to see me about the children."
                        This "cornell" is the same James Cornwell who had been a close friend of
                        Louisa's son Andrew before his death in 1863.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">This letter could date even earlier because a brief mention of removing James
                        "Jimmy" Whitman and a request to "write that man" appeared in Louisa's <a href="duk.00509">December 15, 1867</a> letter to Walt Whitman.
                        Louisa in this letter asked (almost begged) Walt to write Cornwell. The
                        impetus for James Cornwell's visit to Louisa about Andrew and Nancy's
                        children was presumably the letter from Walt that Louisa requested. Walt,
                        however, did not mention Nancy McClure's children or the letter to Cornwell
                        when he acknowledged receipt of letters from his mother in his <a href="upa.00159">April 28–May 4, 1868</a> or his <a href="duk.00650">June 6–8, 1868</a> letters. The intensified
                        efforts appear to date to May and June. Louisa's request for a letter to
                        Cornwell by the end of the month presumably makes May 28, the last Thursday
                        of the month, the last possible date for this letter.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman

                        Andrew Louisa Van Velsor Whitman made this request to Walt Whitman is
                        unclear. She most likely asked Walt to write Cornwell on behalf of the
                        memory of Walt's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman, who died in 1863, for the
                        sake of his three children. Presumably this is what she intended because
                        also referred to "the 3 children" and indicated a plan to share the
                        financial burden of caring for them with the McClures. But she may have
                        asked on behalf of Walt's nephew, Andrew, Jr., who was born to Nancy McClure

                        Whitman's report of Janey McClure's recommendation deploys somewhat cryptic
                        syntax, but her intent can be summarized as follows: If Nancy McClure's
                        children were removed from her care by a legal process, taken "the proper
                        way," then the children could be placed into ("can be got in") the Home of
                        the Friendless. The concern that Nancy would be able to remove her children
                        from an orphanage is consistent with Louisa's <a href="duk.00545">June
                            25, 1868</a> letter to Walt Whitman, in which she stated her own and
