            <p class="tei_p">Well I suppose you have just rec'd the little bound Vol. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Nov
                    Boughs</span>—&amp; I fancy you saying "It looks
                plain &amp; common enough—not handsome or presentable evidently at
                first—but let us see what it has to give us for good—if any"—Dave
                    McKay has taken the lot &amp; will be the publisher—&amp; I am satisfied so—What it all results
                time will show—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">A dark rainy day &amp; I am sitting here as usual, nothing bad—in fact nothing
                very new—a bowel movement this forenoon—no breast &amp;c aches at
                present, but they were bad &amp; continued yesterday &amp; night before last,
                dwelling left side, heart area. To-day I am feeling pretty fairly—Mr &amp; Mrs
                Johnston, my N Y friends, call'd yesterday to see
                me—I had a letter from Buxton Forman (wh' I will
                send you—Horace has it now)—sends authentic the anecdote we heard ab't
                of Geo: Elliot &amp; L of G—I have rec'd a letter f'm Wm O Connor—his eyes are troubling badly—but he wields spirit
                &amp; determination same as ever—am drawing to a close my perusing history
                Louis Fourteenth—poor old <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">creetur</span> (as the old woman said to the Devil)—Every thing quiet here to-day.</p>
