                we sat Sunday afternoon, May 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span>.)
                I must write to you tonight (my last chance this week) but as it is a beautiful evening 
                I decided to ramble out here first—to enjoy the

            <p class="tei_p">The sun is setting behind me—the lake below flecked with ripples reflects the 
                gray blue sky—the gently undulating country just beyond
                green &amp; wooded here &amp; there—with purple moorland hills behind. 
                To the right, across the lake, is the charming little hamlet of
                Rivington, with the Pike beyond.—The birds are singing their evening concert—a thrush

            <p class="tei_p">A most peaceful &amp; sweet ending to a glorious day. No gorgeous display of sunset hues,

                We have wondered many a time how you got through that day, &amp; looked forward

                Dr. J. came to see me again at noon, &amp; in the afternoon brought me one of two copies of 
                the "Camden Post" received from Warry.</p>           
            <p class="tei_p">It pleased us very much to learn from Warry's letter that you had expressed a wish that we, 
                too, were all present That could not be, but our thoughts
