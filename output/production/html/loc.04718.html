            <p class="tei_p">Here I sit in my favourite seat on a bank overlooking Rivington Lake—(where 
                we sat Sunday afternoon, May 31<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">st</span>.)
                I must write to you tonight (my last chance this week) but as it is a beautiful evening 
                I decided to ramble out here first—to enjoy the
                lovely scene &amp; the fresh air. And now while resting here I may as well draft my letter.</p>                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01220_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01220_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01220_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>                
            <p class="tei_p">The sun is setting behind me—the lake below flecked with ripples reflects the 
                gray blue sky—the gently undulating country just beyond
                green &amp; wooded here &amp; there—with purple moorland hills behind. 
                To the right, across the lake, is the charming little hamlet of
                Rivington, with the Pike beyond.—The birds are singing their evening concert—a thrush 
                especially calling loudly close by.</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">A most peaceful &amp; sweet ending to a glorious day. No gorgeous display of sunset hues, 
                but sober, calm, vital &amp; beautiful.

                L. of G. is with me &amp; my thoughts are of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>. 
                Especially so as we have received today your account of your birthday
                "spree" in Camden—(celebrated by us <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">here</span>)</p>            
            <p class="tei_p">Dr. J. came to see me this morning, in great delight,—to 
                shew me your kind good letter just received, &amp; to consult me as to the best way of
                copying it. He also shewed me a good letter he had received from Warry.
                We have wondered many a time how you got through that day, &amp; looked forward
                to some account of it. It was a great pleasure to us to learn that you triumphed so 
                grandly over your infirmities                
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01222_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01222_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01222_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>                
                &amp; that the dinner was such a great success. We rejoice too that you were apparently 
                no worse for it next day, &amp; hope that you have kept better since.
                Dr. J. came to see me again at noon, &amp; in the afternoon brought me one of two copies of 
                the "Camden Post" received from Warry.</p>           
            <p class="tei_p">It pleased us very much to learn from Warry's letter that you had expressed a wish that we, 
                too, were all present That could not be, but our thoughts 
                were with you, &amp; our heart's best love &amp; good will.</p>

                may be marked by greater immunity from pain, by some recovery of strength, &amp;
                by further accession of lovers &amp; friends.</p>           
            <p class="tei_p">I do wish to hear that you are able to get out more &amp; that you are reaping benefit 
                from the summer weather.</p>           
            <p class="tei_p">Sure am I always—as I ramble here—that nature has found no voice to express 
                her like yours—as also that she transcends <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">all</span>
                expression, &amp; promises new &amp; diviner meanings evermore, as we advance 
                on our endless course.</p>
