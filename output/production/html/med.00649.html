            <p class="tei_p">Well here I am in a grand old hotel, the finest in town—the proprietor Mr
                    Ferrin (a stranger too) sent and invited me to stop
                here as the guest of the house &amp; no bill to pay—nice room large, fire in
                it, first rate grub (too good, I am tempted too much)—When I got up this
                morning, snow falling thick &amp; every thing dark &amp; cloudy &amp;
                wintry—but looks a little brighter now—I am feeling pretty
                well—went out around yesterday &amp; last night—great bright stirring
                city, this—great people, these Yankees—I like them—I am used tip
                top here—friends call all the time—lecture
                comes off to-night.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Saturday Evening Lecture went off first rate last night—best I have had yet,
                better audience (better than New York or Philadelphia)—I am enjoying myself
                well—have been out riding today &amp; shall go again to-morrow. I dont know
                that I can tell you anything particularly to interest you but I suppose you will
                like to have a word. I am to stop here till Tuesday or Wednesday next. Love to Harry
                &amp; Ed—I send you a paper—</p>
