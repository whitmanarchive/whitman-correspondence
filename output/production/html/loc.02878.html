            <p class="tei_p">The change down here has refreshed me more than usual and I find my Mother still
                wonderful for her years (the 89th), able to get out daily in her Bath chair for two 
                or three hours—to enjoy our being with her, and suffering little or no pain 
                from rheumatism now.—I hope you have had as glorious a summer &amp; harvest as 
                we have and that you are able to be much out of doors and absorb the health giving 
                influences dear Friend. Such mornings! So fresh and invigorating. I have been before 
                breakfast mostly in a beautiful garden (the old Priory garden) with my beloved Poems 
                and the dew laden flowers and liquid light and sweet fresh air, &amp; the sparkle of 
                the pond &amp; delicious greenness of the meadows beyond &amp; rustling trees and had 
                a joyful time with you my darling—Sometimes with thoughts that lay hold on "the 
                solid prizes of the Universe"<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">1</a> sometimes so busy building up
                a home in America, thinking, dreaming,

                hoping, loving, groping among dim shadows, straining wistful eyes into the dim 
                distance—then to my Poems again—ah! not groping then but hand in hand with 
                you breathing the air you breathe, with eyes ardently fixed in the same direction your 
                eyes look, heart beating strong with the same hopes, aspirations yours beats with. It 
                does not need to be American to love America and to believe in the great future of humanity 
                there; it is enough to be human, still more English, to do that. I love &amp; believe in 
                &amp; understand her in &amp; through you: but was always drawn towards her, always a 
                believer though in a vaguer way that a new glorious day for men &amp; women was dawning 
                there; and recognized a new, distinctive American quality very congenial to me even in 
                American virtues whom you not perhaps rate highly or regard as decisively national, not

                who owns the Priory here fought for two years in the Secession war in the army of the

                John Carwardine was Major in a 
                Cavalry regiment—was at Vicksburg, Frederickburg &amp;c. Never wounded, or but 
                slightly—had a good deal of outpost duty, being just the right sort of man for that 
                &amp; has letters of approval from his Generals of which he is not a little proud. Before 
                that fought under the Stars &amp; Stripes in Mexico &amp; has had a curiously adventurous 
                career which he commenced by running away from a military college where he was being 
                prepared for a cadetship &amp; enlisting as a private—getting out of that by &amp; 
                bye and working his way before the mast as a sailor—then mining in California—then 
                in Australia, riding steeple chases, keeper of the Melrose hounds, market gardening,

                who were friendly &amp; made much of him—now, come into a good estate, married to 
                a woman who seems to suit him well &amp; is healthy, cheerful rich &amp; handsome, he has 
                fallen into indifferent health &amp; considerable depression of spirits. Perhaps he finds 
                the atmosphere of Squirearchical<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> gentility very stagnant, the 
                bed of roses stifling—perhaps too the severe privation he has at different times 
                undergone have injured him. I often think he was perhaps one of those your eyes rested on 
                with pride &amp; admiration—"handsome tan-faced, dressed in blue".
                He is the 
                very ideal of a soldier in appearance &amp; bearing. Has now some fine children of

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    ring: "The enclosed ring I have just taken from my finger &amp; send you with my
                    love." Although Whitman did not write again until 1875, he sent Gilchrist
                    newspapers and magazines. On <a href="loc.03649">November 3, 1873</a>, she
                    wrote about her children; and on <a href="loc.02873">December 18,

                    Walt, you would get along faster. Dearer and sweeter that lot than even to have
                    been your bride in the full flush &amp; strength and glory of your youth. I turn
                    my face to the westward sky and before I lie down to sleep, deep &amp; steadfast
                    within me the silent aspiration that every year, every month &amp; week may help
                    something to prepare and make fitter me and mine to be your comfort and
