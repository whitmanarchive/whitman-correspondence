            <p class="tei_p">Having a half hour to spare I thought I could not better employ it than in writing you—We are getting along pretty well—Mattie has gained a great deal in the last week—although to-day she is not as well as she was a day or two ago yet she can go around without a cane—and without limping much—Hattie and Jessie are well as can be—Jessie is getting fat again—and Hattie looks remarkably well—indeed I think St Louis agrees with her if it dont with the rest of us<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mat has got a pretty good girl now<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—not the best—but good as they run—as soon as she can get around though and see to things herself I suppose matters will go better</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Do you see or read anything about a toy called "Planchett"  There is an article in "Lippencotts" Mag for August on it<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—Davis<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> bought one a few days ago and we tried it but it woul'd[nt] go for us at all—Yesterday a little daughter of a neighbor came in and Mattie and she tried it and it commenced to write answers to all questions like the devil—The thing is a little piece of black walnut abt 7" by 8"—heart shaped and abt ¼" thick <span class="tei_figure_container" id=""><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.00449.001.jpg/full/!700,700/0/default.jpg"/>

            <p class="tei_p">I had a letter from McNamee<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> a few days ago—he told me that George had been sent down to Florence<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> for a short time—has he returned yet—I was glad that the draft came all right—and by the way is that car stable yet on the lots opposite my lot in Flatbush avenue—tell George to look when he goes in that neighborhood  If they should clear that out I dont know but what it would be a good idea to build on that lot one of these days</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mat will write you soon—everything is going abt the same as usual with us—I dont ever hear from Walt—I suppose he is well however—has he been home lately—Love to George Ed and all—write when you can—affectionately</p>
