                    Whitman was in her final months of life, and some of her complaints undoubtedly
                    resulted from fatigue and pain. She was also bothered by George's wife, Louisa,
                    who talked of nothing "much but house and money" and who sent Edward Whitman on
                    many errands but begrudged him his portion of butter. See Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman to Walt Whitman, March 24, 1873, and April 21, 1873 (Trent Collection of
                    Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
                    Library). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
