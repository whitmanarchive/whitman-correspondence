            <p class="tei_p">It is not for want of thinking of you, dear Walt, that I write but seldom: for
                indeed my thoughts are chiefly occupied with you &amp; your other self—your
                Poems—&amp; with struggles to say a few words that I think want saying about
                them; that might help some to their birthright who now stand off, either
                ignorant or misapprehending.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We all go on much as usual.</p>

            <p class="tei_p"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="February​ ">Feb.</span>​  13.</span> I wonder if you will like a true story of Lady Dilke that I
                heard the other day—I do: It was before her marriage. She was a handsome
                young heiress, a daring horsewoman, fond of hunting. There was a man, weakly &amp;
                of good position, who had behaved very basely &amp; cruelly to a young girl in her
                neighborhood, &amp; when (as is the case in England) half the country was assembled
                on the hunting field, Lady D. faced him &amp; said in a voice that could be heard
                afar, "Sir you are a black-guard, &amp; if these gentlemen had the right
                spirit in them they would horsewhip you." He looked at her with effrontery &amp;
                made a mocking bow. "But," she continued, "since they won't, I will"—and she
                cut him across the face with her riding whip; upon which he turned and rode off
                the field, like a dog with his tail between his legs, &amp; reappeared in that
                neighbourhood no more. She was a woman much beloved—died at the birth of her
                first child (from too much chloroform having been given her). Her husband was
                heart-broken. I see you, too, are having floods. With us it pours five days
                out of seven, &amp; so in Germany &amp; France. We have made the acquaintance of
                Arabella Buckley, who has just written an interesting article about Darwin, whom she
                knew well, for the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Century</span>. She says his was the most
                entirely beautiful &amp; perfect nature she ever came in contact with. How I wish we
                could have a glimpse of each other, dear Friend—half an hour talk—nay, a
                good long look &amp; a hand-shake. Herby is overhead painting in his
                studio—such a pleasant room. How is John Burroughs? We owe him a letter &amp;
                thanks for a good <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="article​ ">art.</span>​  on Carlyle. Love to you, dearest friend.</p>
