            <p class="tei_p">Quite sharp &amp; cold this forenoon, &amp; I am sitting by a good oak
                fire—Am still imprison'd in the sick room—Keep up spirits pretty fair,
                but weak as ever in my movements, &amp; being kept indoor for most nine months
                begins to tell on me—I almost wonder I keep as well as I do—but I have
                been pretty low—the doctors—even Dr Bucke—gave me quite up more than once—They just kept life like a little
                light prevented from being all put out (&amp; this was the reason why I often had to
                deny friends from seeing me)—&amp; for a month or so I was in a horrible
                plight—a nuisance to myself &amp; all—but my nurse (Ed Wilkins, the Canadian young man Dr. B. sent) stuck to me &amp; it has
                sort o' pass'd over—or at any rate the worst or it—At present I sit here in the room—Mrs Davis has
                just been in &amp; wishes to send her love to you, &amp; says come up &amp; see
                us—my mentality ab't the same as ever (tho' I get very soon sore &amp; tired
                reading, or being talked to)—&amp; not much show of being any
                better—thankful that things are as well as they are with me—for they
                might be much worse—</p>        
 
            <p class="tei_p">Susan, your good letter came this forenoon &amp; I was glad enough to hear
                from you all—I thank you so much for it I write all this rigmarole at
                    once—Herbert paid me quite a visit last evn'g—I
                fancy he is doing well, &amp; quite a fellow over there among the artists—I
                hear from Edw'd Carpenter—he always wishes to be
                remembered to you all, specially Ed—he seems to be well
                &amp; doing well.—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My books are all completed, these last editions, wh' is a great relief. Eddy my crippled brother is still 
                at Blackwood—(I yesterday paid the
                three months board bill $45.50 there) he is well, &amp; seems to be well off &amp;
                satisfied—young Harry Bonsall died there three or four weeks ago—my sisters
                at Greenport L I and Burlington Vermont are ab't as usual—my brother &amp;
                sister Lou are well at Burlington this state—I think quite often of Harry, &amp; wish you would send this letter over to him
                without fail the first chance you get—it is written largely to him—I
                have what I call <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">sinking spells</span> in my sickness, &amp; I had one the day he last
                visited me—</p> 
            <span class="tei_closer">
                <span class="tei_salute">My best love to him Eva and the little girl</span>
                <span class="tei_salute">Love to you &amp; George, Ed, Van, Deb &amp; Jo and all</span>
