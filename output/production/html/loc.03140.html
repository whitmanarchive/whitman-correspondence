                And I directed him, since he had been so fortunate and understood how to do it, to write at once for

                    Cincinnatus Heine Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of
                    the Rockies" and "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Westminster Review</span> described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness
                    which marked Walt Whitman's poetry" (297). In an entry in his journal dated August 1,
                    1871, the naturalist John Burroughs recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's
                    poetry; see Clara Barrus, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman and
                        Burroughs—Comrades</span> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), 60.
                    Whitman met Miller for the first time in 1872; he wrote of a visit with Miller
                    in a <a href="prc.00026">July 19, 1872</a>, letter to his former publisher and
                    fellow clerk Charles W. Eldridge. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01235_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01235_n1"><span>During the centennial
                    celebration of the U.S. in 1876, Whitman reissued the fifth edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in the repackaged form of a "Centennial Edition" and
                    "Author's Edition," with most copies personally signed by the poet. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Two Rivulets</span> was published as a companion volume to the
                    book. Notable for its experimentations in form, typography, and printing
                    convention, Whitman's two-volume set marks an important departure from previous
                    publications of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. For more information,
