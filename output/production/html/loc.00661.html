            away on tuesday morning
            at half past 5 oclock he came
            home on friday the 3 and staid
            till tuesday he has been quite
            sick some would say very
            sick but he was pretty well
            when he was home
            all but his coughf and he
            thought that was leaving
            him he had a bad coughf
            when he was home before

            and after he went back
            it grew worse and settled
            in his side the first
            doctor he had dident doo
            him any good and then
            he had another a very
            good one that tended him
            he had things put on his
            side very powerfull he
            said his side was nearly
            cooked he must have been
            pretty bad coughf<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr tei_unclear_cert_medium">t</span> so bad
            nights but if he s carefull

            have been worried enoughf
            he dont think the changes
            in the water department will
            make any difference to him
            it was one of the ring that
            wanted the republicans put
            out but the commisioners or
            some of them wouldent
                comply

            your old place</p>
