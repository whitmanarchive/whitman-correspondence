                        8, 1870. The date June 8 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
                        Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1869. Bucke's hurried year on the
                        letter's surface resembles "1864," but he intended 1869. Edwin Haviland
                        Miller dated a letter from Louisa to June 8, 1870, though he assigned the
                        June 8 letter to both the Trent Collection (Duke) and the Library of
                        Congress (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                        New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362; 2:368). Ted Genoways
                        accepted Miller's assignment of the letter to the Trent Collection (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, [1961–2004], 7:136). If Miller
                        referred both times to the same letter but assigned it inadvertently to the
                        Trent Collection in his Check List of Lost Letters (2:362), his date for
                        this Feinberg Collection letter is correct.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa inquired about Walt Whitman's injured thumb, and Walt suffered a
                        serious thumb infection in spring and summer 1870. She also inquired about
                        his thumb in five other letters. Louisa's letter also refers to George
                        Washington Whitman's return to Brooklyn on June 3 as the previous Friday,
                        and June 3 fell on Friday in 1870. George's departure for and return from
                        Brooklyn on Friday are consistent with her <a href="duk.00595">June 1,
                            1870</a> letter to Walt, though then she had expected George to return
                        to Brooklyn on Saturday (June 4). The actions of the Brooklyn Water Board
                        and Louisa's concern that George could be dismissed with Republican-leaning
                        employees are consistent with the early-June 1870 actions of a Democratic
                        Party subcommittee, which petitioned the Brooklyn Water Board to dismiss
                        Republican employees from the Water Works. The year 1870 is therefore near
                        certain.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_loc.00661_n8 note" id="loc.00661_n8"><span>Walt Whitman cut his thumb

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    reorganized in April 1869 with four appointed commissioners, two Republicans and
                    two Democrats (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's <a href="duk.00578">April 7,
                        1869</a> letter to Walt Whitman). The Water Works employed a large work
                    force to pave streets and install water and sewage lines. The Democrat-leaning
                    Brooklyn paper had reported a recent set of layoffs and relished the prospect
                    that many politically active Republicans among those removed from their position
                    could be easily replaced by Democrats. The paper published an appeal by the
                    "Sub-Committee of the Committee Appointed by the Democratic General Committee"
                    to the Water Board for a list of Republican employees who could be replaced by
                    Democrats. William A. Fowler, president of Water Board, rejected the appeal
