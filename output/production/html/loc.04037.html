I may want the stove, to use, this winter, but don't know. The bedstead I give to Debbie if she will accept it—it an't worth much any how.</p>

                    probably sent shortly after Whitman's visit from November 29 to December 6,
                    1878. He was not with the Staffords again until July 2, 1879 (Whitman's
                    Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
                    1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). When he stayed with
                    Susan Stafford, he ordinarily paid her $5 a week for his board. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
