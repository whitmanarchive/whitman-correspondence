                        6th | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | Sep | 1 (?) | N.J.;

                    <p class="tei_p">This postcard cannot be assigned to a specific year for obvious reasons: the
                        allusions to Whitman's health are vague and in fact applicable to almost any
                        time between 1873 and 1876; there are no concrete references to events which
                        would make dating possible. However, it was written on a standard government
                        postcard which was redesigned in 1876.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
