                    (1858–1918) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely
                    overlooked by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears
                    nowhere in the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>—though it does appear frequently in the last
                    three volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally
                    referred to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a <a href="loc.02552">December 13, 1876</a>, letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship
                    between the two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. In 1883, Harry married
                    Eva Westcott. For further discussion of Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
