                to you but you will please forgive me as when I returned from the Army I felt that I
                was 3 years behind and must soon do something <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">tword​ </span></span> fixing for old age. I have been in the West for 4 years past and returned
                to York State a few weeks ago think of staying here for a time to take care of my
                mother<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">2</a>—her health is quite poor.</p>

                years take up and how long has he got to live on it before he can get a title also I
                wish to ask your <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">advise​ </span></span> where would be the best locality to take up said land I know you are
                better posted about these things than I am and shall expect what you have to say for
                the best. How are the times in the City now I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span></span> expect it is as <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">livly​ </span></span> as during the war.

                    most frequently visited in Washington, D.C., during the Civil War. Because of
                    Armory Square's location near a steamboat landing and railroad, it received the
                    bulk of serious casualties from Virginia battlefields. At the end of the war, it
                    recorded the highest number of deaths among Washington hospitals. See Martin G.

                    United States after the Revolutionary War. The 1862 Homestead Act, which granted
                    up to 160 acres of Western public lands to civilians and soldiers, had a minimal
                    provision that allowed soldiers to claim this land before they reached the age
                    of twenty-one. This provision hardly mattered, as most men who served in the Civil War
                    turned twenty-one before war's end. An additional homestead act of 1872, which allowed
                    soldiers to claim land with even fewer restrictions, was passed after this
