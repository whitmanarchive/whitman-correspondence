                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was a British poet and journalist best known for his long narrative poem, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Light of Asia</span> (1879), which tells the life story and
                    philosophy of Gautama Buddha and was largely responsible for introducing
                    Buddhism to Western audiences. Arnold visited Whitman in Camden in 1889. For an
                    account of Arnold's visit, see Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt

                    at all, would be, that he is too eulogistic—too flattering," Whitman
                    concluded. Arnold published his own version of the interview in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Seas and Lands</span> (1891), in which he averred that the two
                    read from <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>, surrounded by Mrs. Davis,
                    knitting, a handsome young man (Ned Wilkins), and "a big setter." There are at
