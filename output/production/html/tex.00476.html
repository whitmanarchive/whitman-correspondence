                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Edw'd Carpenter,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Y'rs came yesterday with the draft $174.37—best &amp; heart-felt
                thanks—it will help me deeply—You speak of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">original draft</span> sent me in May last—no such draft has been rec'd or
                seen or heard of by me, &amp; must have been either lost or miscarried or something
                else—So I shall use <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">this</span> at once—</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I am still cribb'd up in the sick room, now over seven months, but easier &amp; freer
                of late—as I believe I told you in a letter three weeks ago—am very weak &amp; unable to get across the room
                without assistance—but have a good strong nurse—&amp; good medical supervision—sit up most of the days.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am wanting to envelope up &amp; send some copies by Oceanic Express of my "Complete
                Works," a big 900 page Vol. (one copy for you), all directed to my friend R.
                Pearsall Smith, 44 Grosvenor Road, the Embankment,
                London—will send you word when I do so—also wish you to give me address
                of Misses Ford (give them my love) to whom I send a copy
                in same package—As I finish I am comfortable—sitting in my big chair
                here by the oak fire—</p>
