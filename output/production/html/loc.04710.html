                you should have written at all under such circumstances of "deadly lassitude &amp; weakness"—&amp;
                I thank you with a heart full of gratitude &amp; love.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cherish the hope that your long spell of weakness may be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">partly</span> due to the 
                season, &amp; that as the year<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01178_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01178_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01178_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">Copies of the "N E Magazine" have come from Traubel; &amp; last night I had the long looked for pleasure
                of reading his article.—I am delighted with it—even beyond anticipation mainly, of course,
                because of its new information about <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, but also because of its admirable
                workmanship, &amp; its covert glimpses &amp; unconscious portraiture (in part) of Traubel himself.

                of gratitude for his long devotion to you, &amp; every thing goes to shew that in himself he merits
                our warm affection &amp; regard, &amp; to heighten them. And they are especially due from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">us</span>,

                by excursion trains to different parts of the country. 
                The weather, however, has been very unfavourable<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01180_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01180_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01180_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                all week—changeable, very cold at times, &amp; showery. I have decided to spend the holiday quietly
                at home, &amp; Sam Hodgkinson, one of the friends, who is just recovering from "la grippe" is coming
                here to stay with me (Expect him in a few minutes). Doubtless Johnston, too, will run over when
                his professional practice permits.</p>
