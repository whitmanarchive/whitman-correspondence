                card rec'd yesterday—weather rainy wh' we wanted—temperature
                mild—I have a big bunch of lilacs on the table near, (from my yard)—Have
                been looking over some vols: Stedman's big "Am:
                Literature"—seems to be all admirably done—I was reading Paul Jones's
                report to Congress (or his fight with the Serapis)—it all came back to me.</p>
