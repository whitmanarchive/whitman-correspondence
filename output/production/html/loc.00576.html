         <p class="tei_p">Your favor came duly to hand.  We<a href="#n100" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r100">1</a> send you by Express to-day <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">prepaid</span> care of Mr. Clapp of Spruce St—12 copies of the Leaves<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>.

            <p class="tei_p">We do not think that this Summer is the time to commence a rigorous and systematic course of advertising.

We have concocted a plan by which we hope to give the Imprints a very wide and telling circulation, and which we shall put into action immediately<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>. If you will look in the next number of Frank Leslie, an advertisement headed "a Good Book given away" will explain what we mean<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>. This we intend to have go in as an Editorial Advertisement to nearly every paper in the Country, and keep it certainly in.

            <p class="tei_p">I have sent such an advertisement as you hear of to the N.Y. Tribune—for a standing notice.</p>

                    most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan.
                    Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Press</span>
                    in 1858, was instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity; over
                    twenty items on Whitman appeared in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Press</span> before the
                    periodical folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace
                    Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know
                    all about me." (For Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt

                    for the 1855 and 1856 editions. Instead, Whitman had his third edition bound in

                    was a famed actress in New York's Bowery. Mencken published a favorable sketch

                    praising the poet for swimming "against the current." Mencken describes Whitman
                    as "too far ahead of his contemporaries; they cannot comprehend him yet; he
                    swims against the stream and finds me company. The passengers, in their floating
                    boats, call him a fanatic, a visionary, a demagogue, a good-natured fool, etc.,
                    etc. Still he heeds them not: his mental conviction will not permit him to heed
                    them." At the time she endorsed Whitman, Mencken herself was the center of
                    controversy for being a &#x93;mulatto&#x94; actress accused of bigamy and
