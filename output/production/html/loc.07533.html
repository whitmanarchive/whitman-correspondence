            <p class="tei_p">Of late I have two or three times occupied spells of hours or two hours by running
                over with best &amp; alertest sense &amp; mellowed &amp; ripened by five years your
                1883 book (biographical &amp; critical) about me &amp; L of G—&amp; my very
                deliberate &amp; serious mind to you is that you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">let it stand just
                    as it is</span>—&amp; if you have any thing farther to write or print book
                shape, you do so in an <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">additional</span> or further annex (of say
                100 pages to its present 236 ones)—leaving the present 1883 vol. intact as it
                is, any verbal errors excepted—&amp; the further pages as (mainly) reference
                to and furthermore &amp;c. of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the original vol.</span>—the
                text, O'C[onnor]'s letters, the appendix—every page of the 236 left as
                now—This is my spinal and deliberate request—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">conviction</span> the main thing—the details &amp; reasons not put
                    down.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Dr Osler has call'd—evidently all right—I have a good deal of pain (often sort of
                spasmodic, not markedly violent) in the chest &amp; "pit of the stomach" for the last
                three days. O says it is nothing serious or important—&amp; prescribes a mustard
                plaster—lately we have a sort of cold wave &amp; I shouldn't wonder if that was behind
                it—(I have the mustard plaster on now)—It is bright &amp; sunny—rather cool—I have
                rec'd a long letter from Sidney Morse from Chicago—no special news—Mr Summers, M
                P from England, has just call'd &amp; we've had a talk—a nice fellow (how much more &amp;
                more the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">resemblance</span> between the cultivated Englisher and Americaner)—I have been
                reading Miss Pardoe's "Louis XIIII"—I wonder if as a sort of foil to the Carlyle
                reminiscences (T[homas]'s and J[ane]'s)—the same sort of business in another sphere
                &amp; land—Your letters come &amp; are always welcome—As I close I am sitting in my big
                chair in my room 1½ p m quiet &amp; measurably comfortable—</p>
