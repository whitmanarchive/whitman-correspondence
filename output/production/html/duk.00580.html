                    between Sunday, April 25, 1869 and Tuesday, April 27, 1869. Richard Maurice
                    Bucke dated the letter "about 20," and Edwin Haviland Miller accepted Bucke's
                    probable date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New
                    York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). Bucke's and Miller's
                    date, however, is too early: the letter refers to a train accident that occurred
                    on April 23, 1869, which was reported in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily
                        Eagle</span> on April 24, 1869. In addition, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman has
                    received a letter from Walt Whitman (not extant) in which he expressed concerned
                    that his nephew George Van Nostrand was among the accident victims. If Walt
                    received news of the accident on the same day that it was reported in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> and the letter to his mother arrived
                    the next day, the earliest possible date for Louisa's letter is April 25, 1869.
                    The latest possible date is before the return of George Washington Whitman to
                    Brooklyn from Camden on Wednesday or Thursday of that week. Louisa also expected
                    to move to a new residence on Portland Avenue the following Saturday, May 1, the
                    typical moving day in Brooklyn. Because Walt had to write Louisa after he became
                    aware of the railroad accident, because Louisa wrote that she "shall have to
                    move on saturday," and because one assumes that George Washington Whitman would
                    return before the move, the letter must date to between Sunday, April 25, 1869
                    and Tuesday, April 27, 1869. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00580_n6 note" id="duk.00580_n6"><span>Walt Whitman's concern was
                    that "George Van Nostrand," one of the dead in a Long Island railroad accident,
                    was his nephew. George was the son of Walt Whitman's sister Mary Elizabeth
                    (Whitman) Van Nostrand (1821–1899) and Ansel Van Nostrand
                    (1821–1899), who lived at Greenport, Long Island. See Clarence Gohdes and

                        miles east of New York City. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman assumed that Mary Van

                        the Long Island Railroad, some 10 miles east of Brooklyn. But Walt Whitman's
                        fears were not baseless. Mary's son George could well have traveled via the

                    Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
                    in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (ca. 1820–1892),
                    a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
                    for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah, and Louisa often
                    complained about what she here calls "heyds awful letters." Hannah in late 1868
                    suffered a serious thumb infection that led Dr. Samuel Thayer to lance her wrist
                    in November. In early December Dr. Thayer amputated Hannah's thumb. For Louisa's

                    (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
                    Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
                    position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

                    is not extant. However, Mattie's husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman,
                    Louisa's son and Walt's favorite brother, described the family's recent move to
                    a boarding house on Pine street in his <a href="loc.00453">March 25,
                        1869</a> letter to Walt. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie's cough, which Louisa mentions in this letter, was
                    associated with a throat ailment that led to her death in 1873. See Randall H.

                    may not have known Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's exact salary as chief

                    his brothers. Louisa wrote the previous year, based on a report by Moses Lane,
                    that the St. Louis Water Works had "raised Jeffs salary to 6000," a figure that
                    Louisa did not believe (see her <a href="duk.00543">May 5, 1868</a> letter

                    Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
