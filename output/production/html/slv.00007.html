                    (1866–1953) was an Australian poet, lawyer, activist, and journalist. He
                    and his wife, Evangeline Mina Fryer, began a weekly discussion club with secular
                    and Whitmanesque inclinations called the Australeum. His letter of March 12,
                    1890, began a correspondence with Whitman that lasted until November 1, 1891,
                    and assumed the character of a religious experience, always saluting Whitman
                    with reverential appellations. For more, see Alan L. McLeod, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_367.html">Whitman in Australia and New Zealand</a>," J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

The
                    volume was published by the poet himself in an arrangement with publisher David
                    McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves

                    1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding
                    decisions, and Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo
                    of the poet on the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom,

                    (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the
                    individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
                    specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
                    demanding light" (Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>,

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
                    Phyllis Theroux, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Book of Eulogies</span> [New York: Simon

                    Horticultural Hall in Philadelphia, Robert Ingersoll delivered a lecture in

                        Testimonial to Walt Whitman</span>. Whitman recorded in his Commonplace Book
                    that the lecture was "a noble, (very eulogistic to WW &amp; L of G) eloquent
                    speech, well responded to by the audience" and the speech itself was published
                    in New York by the Truth Seeker Company in 1890 (Whitman's Commonplace Book
