                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Friend B O'D,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">The books, in a bundle, (four complete works) have just gone in
                Adams's Express, Wells, Fargo &amp; Co: f'm San Fr, a bundle in brown envelope, (16
                inches square, 4 inches thick, y'r address on) to Melbourne, I have pay'd the
                expressage throughout—Look out for them in due time &amp; if worth while
                inquire there at the main Adams Wells, Fargo &amp; Co Express office—of course
                I sh'l be a little anxious till I hear they have arrived for certain—nothing
                perhaps notable or new ab't self—I sent papers with report of Ingersoll's address here (in Phila) wh' I hope
                have reached you before this time—It was a fine success—big hall filled
                full—$869.45 clear'd above expenses &amp; paid to me—(I will send
                you the printed speech in little book now being printed in N Y)—I keep fairly—appetite fair—a quite
                hearty breakfast at 9 to-day, a meat chop, some oatmeal &amp; cup of tea—the
                grip on me yet and bladder trouble—am writing a little—spirits
                easy—heavy snow storm &amp; cold these days all over hereabout—but I
                keep a stout oakwood fire—&amp; read &amp; write &amp; while away the time
                imprisoned here in my room—hope you get the papers I send—often think of
                you there more than you know—(my favorite notion is to entwine the working
                folk of right sort all round the globe, all lands—that is the foundation of L
                of G, they are banded together in spirit and interest essentially all the earth) My
                respects &amp; love to you &amp; wife &amp; Fred &amp; Jim &amp; 
                Ada &amp;
                Ted &amp; Mr &amp; Mrs Fryer &amp; others
                unspecified—as I finish I hear f'm the express office—<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the bundle is paid thro' <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_quantity_4 tei_gap_unit_chars">[illegible]</span> to you</span> &amp; I sh'll want to
                hear f'm it</p>
