            <p class="tei_p">I came down here yesterday afternoon in the 4½ train. Mrs Stafford has been for over a week, &amp; yet is, quite ill—in bed most of the time—She lies in Deb's room—the one you used to occupy—She is pretty comfortable—is thinner, &amp; more brunette than ever—Keeps pretty cheery—Will get around I think this coming week—had a good night last night &amp; a fair forenoon to-day, (sitting up in the easy chair by the window) but is not quite so well this afternoon (it is now 3)—They have had no doctor so far—I think the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">immediate</span> trouble is of stomach &amp; bowel nature, deeply seated—&amp; the general <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">basic</span> &amp; more or less remote trouble is being fearfully &amp; for a long time overwork'd in body &amp; worried in mind—Still, as I said, I think she will be about again in a few days—As at present, though a quite sick woman, nothing serious indicated—Debby has been home the past week, but is to go away to-night—Mr Stafford is well as usual—was up to the city with a load of straw yesterday.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1878-08-04">Sunday forenoon Aug 4</span></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am writing this down by the pond, in the cool of the willows close by the gurgling brook—a hot walk down the lane &amp; across the big field, but the strong sun welcome to me, for all that—Here I sit (have hung my shirt on a bush to dry)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">All here just as you used to see it—only more so—more luxuriant, un-trimm'd, bushy, weedy than ever—the locust (cicada) sounds firmly to-day here—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mrs S[tafford] down in the kitchen this morning—I rose early &amp; made the fire, &amp; assisted Ruthey in getting the breakfast—We had a fine meal—I made the coffee &amp; (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">of course</span>) it was good—No mail to-day &amp; I must wait to send this to-morrow—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p"><span class="tei_date tei_date_when_1878-08-05">August 5th</span></p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am writing this up in Harry's &amp; my room at K[irkwood]—Mrs S is much better to-day—She is about seeing to things somewhat as usual—(A great part of her illness is some peculiar trouble, or breakage or rupture to which <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">women</span> only are liable—in her case aggravated by overwork)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">It is a wet foggy forenoon—Debby went away with Jo Saturday night—George has gone up to the City with a load of sugar-corn—Harry has gone over to his work at the station—Ed to the store—Lizzie Hider was over here Saturday afternoon &amp; evening—Bill Peak (epileptic), the miller's son at Tomlinson's, has been arrested for purloining a lot of Camden &amp; Atlantic RR tickets—Old Mr Morgan has been dead six weeks—you knew that Mrs Lizzie Stafford (Ben's wife) was dead &amp; buried—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Shall send this over by Harry to mail after dinner—Much obliged for the designs on the block—very nice—also the letter—both arriving safe—Give my best love to your mother—tell her I am well, &amp; shall branch off somewhere (I hardly know where) for the rest of the summer, &amp; will not forget to send some written or printed sign of my whereabout, if any chances—Her letter of a week since was rec'd just as I was starting out—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I shall go up either this afternoon or to-morrow.</p>
