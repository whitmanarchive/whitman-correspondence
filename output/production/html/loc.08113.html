                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
                    deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
                    brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</span> posited civilization as
                    a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
                    society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
                    contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On <a href="loc.01231">July 12, 1874</a>, he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
                    have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
                    in my heart . . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
                    instinct of their nature." For further discussion of Carpenter, see Arnie

                    journalist and friend of Karl Marx, became acquainted with Whitman during the
                    Civil War. Swinton, managing editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York
                    Times</span>, frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he probably met Whitman.
                    Whitman's correspondence with Swinton began on <a href="bos.00006">February
                        23, 1863</a>. Swinton's enthusiasm for Whitman was unbounded. On <a href="loc.01955">September 25, 1868</a>, Swinton wrote: "I am profoundly
                    impressed with the great humanity, or genius, that expresses itself through you.
                    I read this afternoon in the book. I read its first division which I never
                    before read. I could convey no idea to you of how it affects my soul. It is more
                    to me than all other books and poetry." On <a href="loc.01957">June 23,
                        1874</a>, Swinton wrote what the poet termed "almost like a love letter":
                    "It was perhaps the very day of the publication of the first edition of the
                    'Leaves of Grass' that I saw a copy of it at a newspaper stand in Fulton street,
                    Brooklyn. I got it, looked into it with wonder, and felt that here was something
                    that touched on depths of my humanity. Since then you have grown before me,
                    grown around me, and grown into me" (Horace Traubel, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt
                        Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.13.html">Tuesday, April 10, 1888</a>). He praised Whitman in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Herald</span> on April 1, 1876 (reprinted in Richard Maurice Bucke,
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883],
                    36–37). Swinton was in 1874 a candidate of the Industrial Political Party
                    for the mayoralty of New York. From 1875 to 1883, he was with the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Sun</span>, and for the next four years edited the
                    weekly labor journal, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">John Swinton's Paper</span>. When this
                    publication folded, he returned to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sun</span>. See Robert
