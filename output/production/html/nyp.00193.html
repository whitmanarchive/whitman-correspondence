            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I have nothing of consequence to write, but I thought I would send you a few lines anyhow. I have just written Nelly a letter, &amp; send to Little Compton—We are full of politics here, the dispute runs high &amp; hot everywhere—I think the Republicans are going to make a stout fight after all, as there is confusion in the opposition camp—the result of course I do not pretend to foretell—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">My health is quite re-established, yet not exactly the same unconscious state of health as formerly—The book is still unprinted—Our family are all well as usual—I go two or three times a week among the soldiers in hospital here—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I go out quite regularly, sometimes out on the bay, or to Coney Island—&amp; occasionally a tour through New York life, as of old—last night I was with some of my friends of Fred Gray association,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> till late wandering the east side of the City—first in the lager bier saloons &amp; then elsewhere—one crowded, low, most degraded place we went, a poor blear-eyed girl bringing beer. I saw her with a McClellan medal on her breast—I called her &amp; asked her if the other girls there were for McClellan<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> too—she said yes every one of them, &amp; that they wouldn't tolerate a girl in the place who was not, &amp; the fellows were too—(there must have been twenty girls, sad sad ruins)—it was one of those places where the air is full of the scent of low thievery, druggies, foul play, &amp; prostitution gangrened—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I don't know what move I shall make, but something soon, as it is not satisfactory any more in New York &amp; Brooklyn—I should think nine tenths, of all classes, are copperheads here, I never heard before such things as I hear now whenever I go out—then it seems tame &amp; indeed unreal here, life as carried on &amp; as I come in contact with it &amp; receive its influences—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">How is Ashton? &amp; is he there again?<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I got a letter from Charley Eldridge yesterday—I suppose he is now in Boston—My dear friend, I often often think of you, &amp; count on our being together again, may be quite soon—meantime good bye &amp; God bless you &amp; I send you my best best love—</p>

                    McClellan (1826–1885) was General-in-Chief of the Army of the United
                    States from November 1861, until July 1862, when he was replaced by General
                    Henry W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic
                    party split between war Democrats and peace Democrats. To satisfy the war
                    Democrats McClellan was nominated; to satisfy the peace Democrats C. L.
                    Vallandigham and his followers were allowed to draft the platform. Thomas
                    Jefferson Whitman evidently considered the entire Democratic party as "the peace
                    party" as evidenced from the letter to his brother Walt dated <a href="loc.00416">July 7, 1863</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00193_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00193_n4"><span>On <a href="med.00324">August 13, 1864</a>, O'Connor had reported that Ashton

                    Lewis Kirke Brown (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near
                    Rappahannock Station on August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days.
                    Eventually he was transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him,
                    probably in February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman
                    described Brown on February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond
                    of having me come and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was
                    amputated on January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in
                    a diary (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
                    Congress, Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was
                    employed in the Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from
                        <a href="nyp.00193">September 11, 1864</a>
                    . The following
                    September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
                    of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
                    in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
                    family and is now held in the Library of Congress.) </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_nyp.00193_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="nyp.00193_n6"><span>There is no indication in
