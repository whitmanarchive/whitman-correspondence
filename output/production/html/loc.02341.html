                    (1816–1901) was an abolitionist and industrialist. Born in New Jersey,
                    Hyatt moved to Kansas in the 1850s with a plan to develop local industry, where
                    he befriended abolitionist John Brown. Following Brown's execution in 1859,
                    Hyatt raised funds to support Brown's widow and children and was brought to
                    Washington, D.C., to testify before the U.S. Senate committee investigating the
                    events at Harper's Ferry. After refusing to testify, he was jailed at Capitol
                    Prison for three months. Upon release, he briefly served as American consul at
                    La Rochelle, France, before building a home in London using his own patented
                    concrete. There, he developed the translucent paving tiles that made him a small
                    fortune. During the last years of his life, Hyatt divided his time between
                    Brooklyn and the British Isles and died in 1901 while vacationing with his
                    family on the Isle of Wight. He is the author of several books, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Prayer of Thaddeus Hyatt to James Buchanan, President of

                    (1811–1896) and Orson Squire Fowler (1809–1887) were brothers from
                    Cohocton, New York, and well-known phrenologists. They established a
                    Phrenological Cabinet in Clinton Hall in New York City in 1842, where Whitman
                    received a phrenological examination in 1849. The Fowlers' brother-in-law Samuel
                    R. Wells also joined the firm, which later came to be known as Fowler and Wells.
                    The firm published numerous books and magazines on phrenology, reform, and
                    self-help topics, and anonymously published Whitman's second edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1856. For more information, see
