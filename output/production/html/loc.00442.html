            <p class="tei_p">We hav'nt heard from you for some time<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—you say the bundle was not the right one—I read the label and thought it read the same as you described in your letter—would you like me to send the other or right one if I can find it—Mother told me she knew the one you meant and that she would put it on the table for me<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—that is the one I sent</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had a letter from Mother to-day—she seems pretty well—talks a little of coming home but does not say when—I have just written her this eve—We are all as well as usual—the baby has a bad boil on its forehead but I suppose it will get well in a day or two and then she will be all right again—it looks just now though about as bad as anything of the kind I ever saw  by-the-way it was me that had the "run around" on the finger<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—and I have just got well of it—and a cussed bad time I had of it too—it accounts for my not writing you before—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">George is getting along first rate I guess—He dont say any more about getting a position in the Custom House—I hope he wont try but I am quite sure that if he can keep devoted to his present undertaking he will make a handsome fortune in 8 or ten years<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—he certainly has the prospect of it—there is an immense amount of building in the city this season—though material is wonderful high—brick $12 per thousand—should be abt 5 or 6—I have given up all thought of building this fall—at one time I thought I would sure  perhaps next spring will be better</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Matters about Brooklyn are much the same—with me just the same—Mr Kirkwood<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> has been on a visit to Brooklyn and just gone back to St. Louis—I think it more than likely that he will build the water works of that city—if so it will be as large a job as the Brooklyn works</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Doctor<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> returned from the country last week—he looks first rate—says he had a wonderfully good time—he was spending the summer up in Vermont near Burlington—speaks of it as being a splendid place to live—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">In her letter to-day Mother says she wants either you or George to come on and come home with her<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—so I suppose she begins to think of coming home</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mattie and the children desire to send their love to you—the child[ren] are growing first rate—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I wish you would write me  I want to know how things are going with you</p>

                    letter to the family had been written on about September 20 (Edwin Haviland

                    Whitman of September 5, 1865, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman seemed confident that
                    she knew which bundle the poet wanted: "if you want Jeff to send that package of
                    papers you must write to him" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University
                    Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). It is not clear what
                    material Whitman was seeking. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00442_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00442_n3"><span>Jeff's failure to
                    include a period after "says" in his letter to Walt from <a href="loc.00441">September 11, 1865</a> created ambiguity. The poet must have understood
                    Jeff's letter to mean that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had the "run around" on her
                    finger. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00442_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00442_n4"><span>Jeff was right in
                    thinking that George would eventually prosper. At his death in 1901 George left
                    an estate valued at $59,348.14. No one has discovered how he accumulated so
                    much money (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Civil War Letters of George

                    Edward Ruggles (1817?–67) befriended the Whitman family and became
                    especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
                    practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
                    (Miller, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Correspondence</span>, 1:90, n.85). While near

                    Whitman was especially interested in having Walt come to get her because she and
