            <p class="tei_p">You have had many tributes from the learned and great of Europe and America, yet you
                will not despise that of a simple, honest woman who writes to thank you, in all
                sincerity for those "Leaves of Grass" from which her soul has drawn such health,
                freshness and aroma. I visited Washington for the first time, this May. The guest of
                Mrs. Schwartz, (who one night in passing off the platform of a
                Car, gave you a rose) I was compelled to many Car rides in my transit to "the City".
                On Car No 14, I encountered you more than once. Your face, which I chose to think a
                    <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">facsimile</span> of the grand old patriarch's, Abraham, attracted me. Through Mr.
                Devlin,
                from Mr. Doyle, I was allowed to read your—I
                prefer saying—I was permitted a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">long look</span> into that
                wonderful mirror of your creation, where I saw the reflex of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">your</span>

                idle curiosity I first opened it, at the very stanza, "Perfections" which I have
                just quoted. Life held grander possibilities to me from that hour, and the mission
                of a soul, born into this world to love, influence, and suffer, was invested with
                profounder responsibilities.</p>
