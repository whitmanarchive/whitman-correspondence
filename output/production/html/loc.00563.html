         <p class="tei_p">When we wrote you last week that our Mr. Thayer would be in NYork on Saturday and see you, he was in another section of Country and anticipated being in York without fail on the day we stated, on his way home, but circumstances have prevented his coming that way at all.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We would therefore say that we will agree to give you the amount you wish per week for four or five weeks, and shall expect to see you at our place on Monday or Tuesday of next week, when we shall be able to attend to your work &amp; put it through</p>
