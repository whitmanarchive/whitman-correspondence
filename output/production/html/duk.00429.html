                some pie she said he eat
                that and 3 eggs so his throat
                couldent hurt him so bad

                another young one they would
                be so stingy we wouldent know
                what to doo but i got the same
                old retort that it was me that
                was stingy with my bank book
                
                that is such a common thing
                to hear if i make any remark
                that i would like to have any
                thing <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_illegible tei_gap_extent_one tei_gap_extent_word tei_gap_unit_chars tei_gap_quantity_2">[illegible]</span> why donti get it with

                it all i might go to the poor
                house sometimes i think i wish the bank book as they call it was
                in guinea sis too says grandma
                take your bank book i suppos
                walt you ll think i are foolish
                and childish but i get out
                of patience sometimes Jeffy
                wanted me to take Andrew
                here
                he said he would
                feed him well i dident
                feel walter as if i could
                undertake it they would
                soon get tired of fixing things
                for him and i know if i had
                him i must have the whole
