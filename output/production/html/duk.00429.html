                    <p class="tei_p">Although Louisa Van Velsor Whitman provided no clear clue about the date of
                        this letter in her own hand, a wide range of contextual matters, some
                        conflicting, make it possible to date this letter to a range between
                        September 5 and September 23, 1863. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the
                        approximate date November 1, 1863 on an accompanying slip of paper in the
                        Trent Collection (not reproduced here). Edwin Haviland Miller dated this
                        letter September 3, 1863 (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                            Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                        1961–77], 1:144–145, n. 33). Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M.
                        Price dated this letter both September 10? and September 15?, 1863 (see
                        Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's <a href="loc.00421">September 5,
                            1863</a> and <a href="loc.00423">September 24, 1863</a> letters
                        to Walt Whitman).</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa either enclosed a letter from George Washington Whitman or had
                        recently forwarded a letter from him with her previous letter (her
                        postscript is ambiguous). As mail from George when he was stationed in
                        Kentucky took approximately a week to reach Brooklyn (but often longer),
                        Louisa may have enclosed George's <a href="duk.00345">September 7,
                            1863</a> letter. If a letter from George was enclosed with this or
                        with Louisa's previous letter to Walt (not extant), the approximate range of
                        dates for this letter extends from September 12 to September 23. A letter
                        preceding George's September 7 letter, or an intermediate letter from
                        George, may be lost, but Walt in his <a href="loc.00791">September 29,
                            1863</a> letter to Louisa wished for news from George: Walt's receipt
                        of this letter from Louisa with George's letter enclosed thus rules out a
                        date after September 23, 1863. This approximate range of dates (September 5
                        to September 23) is corroborated by topics in Jeff Whitman's September 24,
                        1863 letter to Walt, though some topics in Louisa's letter may suggest an
                        earlier date.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa was in sharp disagreement with Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell
                        "Mattie" Whitman over assistance that they could, or should, extend to the
                        family of Andrew Jackson Whitman. Jeff and Mattie were willing to provide
                        more nourishing food for Andrew because they feared neglect could contribute
                        to his death, but Jeff and Mattie refused to provide direct aid to Andrew's
                        wife Nancy and their children. Louisa challenged Jeff and Mattie to be more
                        generous to James "Jimmy," Andrew and Nancy's son. Jeff and Mattie insisted
                        that Louisa should use her "bank book"—her deposits of George's
                        military pay—if she wished to assist Jimmy. Jeff charged Louisa with
                        mistaken notions of economy—she scrimped on the food for herself and
                        sons Jesse and Edward when George's military pay could provide relief.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Because Louisa again discussed the expense of Andrew's two drunken
                        sprees—$30 and $10—on the heels of his recovery from a
                        debilitating episode of pleurisy, this letter could date to near Louisa's
                            <a href="duk.00427">August 31 to September 2, 1863</a> letter to
                        Walt, in which Andrew's two sprees are mentioned with a sense that the
                        second spree occurred within the past week. Jeff's suggestion—bringing
                        Andrew into the Portland Avenue home, which Louisa rejected—also
                        appears in Jeff's <a href="loc.00421">September 5, 1863</a> letter to
                        Walt. The parallel between Jeff's suggestion on Andrew and Louisa's
                        rejection of it may have prompted Miller's early September 3, 1863 date for
                        this letter, but Louisa's reference to Jeff's suggestion in this letter is
                        perfunctory, as a matter that she had long dismissed from consideration.
                        Because no pattern of consistencies among topics is predominant, the letter
                        is assigned to a date range from September 5 to September 23, 1863.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Louisa's <a href="duk.00430">September 25 or October 2, 1863</a> letter
                        to Walt almost certain follows this one, and October 2 is a more likely date
                        for that letter. However, if that letter dates to September 25 rather than
                        October 2, this letter is likely to date earlier in the range of possible
                        dates, to no later than September 18. The parallel passages with Jeff's <a href="loc.00421">September 5, 1863</a> and <a href="loc.00423">September 24, 1863</a> letters to Walt are annotated, and readers may
                        judge for themselves which parallels offer the most convincing evidence for
                        assigning this letter within the range from September 5 to September 23,

                    was thrifty because she desired to preserve George Washington Whitman's military
                    pay as much as possible for his use. A comment in Walt Whitman's <a href="loc.00794">October 6, 1863</a> letter to Louisa, which refers to a
                    letter that is not extant, suggests that Walt hoped to counteract Louisa's pride
                    in her thriftiness with George's money. Walt enlisted George himself to pressure
                    Louisa to spend more freely: "I sent him enclosed your letter before the last,

                        so—they did not have that 'citizen feeling' that our militia would
                        have had. The only feeling I have is that I fear that they did not kill
                        enough of 'em Walt. I'm perfectly rabid on an Irishman I hate them worse
                        than I thought I could hate anything" (see Jeff's <a href="loc.00418">July 19, 1863</a> letter to Walt Whitman). Louisa in her <a href="duk.00599">July 20, 1870</a> letter speculated that one
                        positive result of the Franco-Prussian War would be if it inspired some
                        Irish immigrants to leave the United States.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r29">back</a>]</li><li id="n17">21. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00427_n17 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00427_n17"><span>George "Georgy" Whitman was
