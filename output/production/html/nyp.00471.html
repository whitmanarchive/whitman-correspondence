            <p class="tei_p">Yes I will give you the autograph name &amp; perhaps a sentiment—but would like first to see the picture they would
                go under—Most of the pictures that have been put out of me, quite warrant the
                alarming estimation so many folks entertain—(If it is the drawing F Fowler
                took two years ago in Huntington L[ong] I[sland], <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">I dont like it at all</span>.) I send you some samples—&amp; should be
                entirely satisfied with a good bold simple rendering of either of the three—If
                you do it at all why not try to do it <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">well</span>.</p>
