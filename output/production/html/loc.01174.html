                I was very glad to see that you was able to get down stairs to your thanksgiving dinner, &amp;
                I trust you will be able to get down to your Christmas dinner, &amp; to do full justice to it. 
                We are dwellers in this town again this winter. Wife hired rooms here 1st of Nov, &amp; went to 
                housekeeping. I clung to the farm &amp; lived alone with my dog, coming down here Sundays 
                &amp; stormy weather. Now the snow has come I

                shall probably be here most of the time. I am pretty well, but a good deal troubled. The old farm
                where I was born has come back upon my hands &amp; is very embarrassing. I tried to help my
                brother through with it, but he has proved unequal to the task &amp; I have had to take it to secure
                myself from heavy loss. But I shall lose 8 or 9 hundred dollars in any event &amp; may be much more, 
                I go out there again this afternoon. Julian<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> goes to school &amp; is well,

                but says there are things in them that make her gasp. Her mother, a lady of 80 is very enthusiastic 
                over them. She seems to be one of the best readers you ever had.

                I suppose a great poet has passed away in Browning.<a href="#n0116" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0116">4</a> It is curious that I can make nothing of him. His 
                manner always repells me &amp; his matter 
                is not interesting. I trust you keep well as usual &amp; that I shall hear from you soon

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
