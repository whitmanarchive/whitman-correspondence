                I was very glad to see that you was able to get down stairs to your thanksgiving dinner, &amp;
                I trust you will be able to get down to your Christmas dinner, &amp; to do full justice to it. 
                We are dwellers in this town again this winter. Wife hired rooms here 1st of Nov, &amp; went to 
                housekeeping. I clung to the farm &amp; lived alone with my dog, coming down here Sundays 
                &amp; stormy weather. Now the snow has come I

                shall probably be here most of the time. I am pretty well, but a good deal troubled. The old farm
                where I was born has come back upon my hands &amp; is very embarrassing. I tried to help my
                brother through with it, but he has proved unequal to the task &amp; I have had to take it to secure
                myself from heavy loss. But I shall lose 8 or 9 hundred dollars in any event &amp; may be much more, 
                I go out there again this afternoon. Julian goes to school &amp; is well, 
                Mrs. B. is pretty well.

                Kingsley. She wrote me for a copy of your poems. She is greatly taken with them, 
                but says there are things in them that make her gasp. Her mother, a lady of 80 is very enthusiastic 
                over them. She seems to be one of the best readers you ever had.

                I suppose a great poet has passed away in Browning. It is curious that I can make nothing of him. His 
                manner always repells me &amp; his matter 
                is not interesting. I trust you keep well as usual &amp; that I shall hear from you soon
