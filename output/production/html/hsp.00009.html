        <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I suppose you got my postal card. I am still about the same as then—or, if any different, 
        it is on the side of relief &amp; improvement—I have the feeling to go out &amp; try to get around—have better spirits than I could expect—but on trial, the least exertion confuses my head, 
        &amp; overcomes me. But I am sitting here at present in my room, comparatively comfortable—&amp; feel every hope that I shall be able to give better account of myself next week. 
        I am still clear of the pronounced bad spells of seven or eight days ago—a great gain &amp; let-up. The weather here is fine.
      </p>
