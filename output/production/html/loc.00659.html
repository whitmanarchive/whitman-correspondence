                    December 3, 1872. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter Tuesday. A note on
                    the first page in Walt Whitman's hand dated it December 3, 1872, a Tuesday.
                    Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with the assigned date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:369). The assigned date is corroborated by multiple details in
                    the letter and is correct. Louisa, who was in Camden, New Jersey, had received a
                    money order from Walt to pay Edward's board to Louisa Orr Whitman, so the letter
                    must date in the first week of a month. The holiday Thanksgiving has just
                    passed, so the month is December. And George Washington Whitman's most recent
                    stint as an inspector for the Brooklyn Water Works has come to an end, also
                    consistent with December 1872. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00659_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.00659_n2"><span>Louisa Orr Haslam
