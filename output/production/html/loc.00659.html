                i am troubled at times with
                a dissiness in my head i think

                the stoves open and the gass)  
                i had mr and mrs bruce
                and grace to see me
                the day
                after thanksgiving they only
                stayed a short time as they
                were going home that day
                at 12 or 1 oclock i was very
                glad to see them very indeed

                he was notified last week by
                mr adams from the commishons
                he has had his pay for three
                months without their having
                any work done at stars
                i beleeve he thinks he will
                have it again but i dont
                think its so dreadfull to only
                get 8 dollar per day but its put
                the house question down</p>
