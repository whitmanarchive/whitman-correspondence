                    carefully explained on July 10 that he had given a slightly misleading
                    impression of the Post Office's decision since the ruling applied only to George
                    Chainey's pamphlet, not to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> as a book.
                    However, the interpretation offered by Judge Charles A. Ray, the law officer of
                    the Post Office Department, meant in effect that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
