            <p class="tei_p">
                Y'r letter Susan rec'd &amp; welcomed, &amp; of course I was
                glad to hear f'm you all but hoped that George had fully or most
                fully recovered—but it is slow &amp; tedious work &amp; I
                hope &amp; trust for the best. I want to come down &amp; see him
                &amp; I hope to yet.—Still keeps pretty dull &amp; poorly
                with me going down slowly but surely all the time—pretty
                serious catarrh (probably) in the head &amp; bowels too—&amp;
                bladder malady—havn't been out the past week—am comfortable
                here wood fire—cloudy out &amp; looks &amp; feels like snow—have
                had a couple of visitors to–day, one f'm the college near Boston—My brother
                George return'd f'm St Louis &amp; was here a couple of
                hours—my neice Jessie remains at present
                in St L—It was all a dark &amp; rather sudden blow—Susan I enclose
                two dollars for Harry's little ones, give it to
                Eva for them—Maybe Harry will be here in a day
                or two I hope he will—That bad accident here on the foolish misplacing
                of the RR switch—we knew the poor conductor Leap, kill'd
                (leaves 6 children poor enough)—Love to you all—Ed stop here often
                as you can—you too Susan—George keep a good heart—my love
                to you Harry dear—
            </p>
