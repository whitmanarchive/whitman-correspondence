            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been home to Brooklyn, N. Y. on a visit to my mother, but I am now back here again, 
                and am well as usual, and working in the same place. Your letter of August 15, 
                and the letter of Oct. 2, have both reached me, &amp; I was very glad to hear from you &amp; your folks, 
                &amp; to get such friendly letters. Dear boy, I should like much to pay you a visit, 
                &amp; to be with you 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01561.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01561.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01561.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                for a while, &amp; to become acquainted with your father &amp; mother—it would be a real comfort to me, 
                &amp; I am determined to come one of these days—I often think about it, &amp; about you too, 
                dear friend, &amp; one of these days we will see each other again.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">There is nothing very new in my affairs. I have had quite a pleas-ant summer, 
                &amp; now the fall is here—the past three weeks has been splendid weather here, both days &amp; nights—but to-day there is a heavy rain—looks as if it had set in for a long storm—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I am living at a boarding house, the same place where you come to see me, but new landlord 
                &amp; landlady—472 M st.—it is quite pleasant—mostly young people, full of life &amp; gayety—then I go to my work at 9, &amp; leave at 3—so you see it is easy enough—In about three weeks more it will be lively times here in Washington, as Congress is to meet then, &amp; there will be some important questions brought up—but I take all these things very coolly—&amp;, since the war is over, <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">dont​ </span><span class="tei_corr">don't​

            <p class="tei_p">You must write to me often as you can. I shall probably remain here this winter. I wish you to give my love to your father &amp; mother. They do not seem at all like strangers to me.
            </p> 
                
            <p class="tei_p">And now Alfred I must bid you farewell for the present, my loving boy &amp; comrade.—When you write, write to me about the farm, &amp; the farm-life, crops, horses, &amp;c. for I like to hear about such things too.
