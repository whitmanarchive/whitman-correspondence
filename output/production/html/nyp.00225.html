            <p class="tei_p">it is rumored that we have the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">South Side Rail Road</span> now in Earnest. I hope it may be So, but as yet we have no Official report andonly have the news from men that Say they have been to the front they Say it is correct. Yet I don't write it for Shure as we have been fooled So many times with the Same news.</p>
