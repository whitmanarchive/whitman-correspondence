                solitary old tower. I am just about to set off to climb it, and as I stand there
                shall remember to wing yet another shaft of imagination to you sitting solitary
                perchance in Mickle St.! With all desires, that you may have poet's thoughts still

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
