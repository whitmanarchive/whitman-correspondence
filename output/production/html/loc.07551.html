            <p class="tei_p">Every thing much the same—Y'rs of 4th rec'd—dark lowering
                weather—no Dr Walsh now four days (Is it a good
                sign?)—Any thing like strength is very slowly coming to me—but I fall
                back thankfully on being not such in a wretched way as three or four weeks
                ago—Ed W[ilkins] is well (but has disagreeable spells of
                heart burn)—</p>
