                to-day—nearly two hours—a nice visit—they are well—appear to
                be enjoying their trip—we all liked them much—they have been to
                Niagara—I wrote you a while ago that the books had come, &amp; that I liked
                the get up of them—I will send very soon some more stuff for the "Democratic
                Vistas,&amp;c. &amp;c." Vol. Fine summer weather—</p>
