            <p class="tei_p">Yours <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​ —I am now back here finishing up—only stayed a few days in Concord, but they were <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="marked​ ">mark'd</span>​  days. Sunday, Emerson &amp; his wife, son Edward &amp; wife &amp;c. gave
                me a dinner—two hours—every thing just right every way—a dozen
                people there, (the family &amp; relatives)—for my part I thought the old man
                in his smiling and alert quietude &amp; <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">withdrawness​ </span><span class="tei_corr">withdrawnness​
        
      </span></span>—he has a good color in
                the face &amp; ate just as much dinner as any body—more eloquent, grand,
                appropriate &amp; impressive than ever—more indeed than could be
                described—Wasn't it comforting that I have had—in the sunset as it
                were—so many significant affectionate hours with him under such quiet,
                beautiful, appropriate circumstances?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The book is done &amp; will be in the market in a month or so—all about it has
                proceeded satisfactorily—&amp; I have had my own way in every thing—the
                old name "Leaves of Grass" is retained—it will be a $2 book—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I shall probably go on to New York in about a week—shall stay at Johnston's,
                (address me there Mott avenue &amp; 149th street N Y city) about a week or ten
                days—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Besides this general death-gloom of the nations—have you heard of the sudden &amp; dreadful death of our young friend
                Beatrice Gilchrist in performing some chemical experiment with ether?</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Joaquin Miller is here—is with me every day—Longfellow has been to see
                    me—I have met O W Holmes &amp; old Mr James.</p>
