                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Friend:</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">
                I have just read through again more carefully "Good-Bye my F."
                I think "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">The Pallid Wreath</span>,"
                "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Old Age's Ship &amp; Crafty D.</span>"
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">To the Sunset Breeze</span> and the
                last "Good-B my F" (did you notice that you had two
                of the same title?) are alone enough to justify the book
                &amp; are as great as anything you have done in many years.
                The pantheistic necromancy in the last lines of the last poem
                come with a freshness of surprise that is very pleasant
                to a mystical mind.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">  
                I hope the hot weather is not taking you down.</p>

                Rec'd Traubel's wedding card from London!
                Give him my congratulations! Howells
                writes me that Garland's book
                of stories pleases him immensely

                it is so fresh &amp; aggressive. Garland &amp; I had a
                grand day with the "Listener" &amp; Bradford Torrey the
                bird lover at—Newton Lower Falls (Wellesley) on
                Decoration Day. Stayed to Brown bread &amp; Beans supper
                (good!) got up by hearty Western wife of Chamberlin (Listener).
                Saw humming bird's nest on apple bough (occupied, live &amp;
                exquisite).</p>
