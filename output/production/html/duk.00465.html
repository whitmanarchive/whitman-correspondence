            <p class="tei_p">i have got along very well
            up to about 2 weeks ago and since that
            time goerge has been moody and would hardly speak only when i
                spoke to him well of course you will say mother put the worst constructions on it
                well Walt i did not the first few days i thought perhaps something had gone wrong in
                his business affairs but up to to day he has been so different from what he was ever
                since i have been home<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">4</a> but to day he is more like
                himself Well Walt i thought of every thing sometimes i would think
                        maybee he is tired of having
                me and Edd<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">5</a> and then i would
            think george is too noble a fellow
            for that to be the cause and i knew
            that i had not or he had not
            been to more expence than if
                he paid his board Jeffy<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">6</a> told me

            but i dident like to i would ask
            him if he wasent well and so on
            but i doo hope it will go over
            i acted just the same as if i did
            not notice any change but i felt
            awful bad and what has
            made him act so god only knows
            but i believe it runs in the
            Whitman family to have such
            spells any how i hope they
            wont come often) Jeff is quite
            sick to day he was sick nearly
            all night vomiting and purging
            he has eaten very heartily
            lately he eat chicken and stuffing
            for his supper and cranberry
            pie before he went to bed and
            i think that is one great cause
            of his sickness he looks bad
            but probably it will doo him
            good to have a good clearing

                    Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Also, the letter mentions a recent theft of a watch

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the

                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    difficult to decipher. The transcription of the text, letter by letter, is
                    probably "recent parknesses." The first letter in each word, however, is written
                    over and the reading is doubtful. Because the letter refers to local burglaries
                    and fights in the City Park near the Naval Yard, the intended phrase could be
                    "recent park [me]nesses," with the "me" omitted inadvertently. The criminal
                    activity that menaced the City Park near the Naval Yard followed mass layoffs of
