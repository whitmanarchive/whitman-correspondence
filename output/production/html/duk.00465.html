            <p class="tei_p">i have got in
            the habit of writing to you
            every sunday so i thought
            i wouldent break through
            to day) i received your letter
            yesterday after looking all day
            for one i was glad to have
            the letter and glad to have the
            2 dollars at noon i hadent one
                cent and i asked georgee to
            give me 50 cents and after looking
            for a considerable time he laid
            me down 50 cents
            well Walt i felt
            so bad and child like i cried because
            he dident give me more if i had
            got the 2 dollars a little sooner i
            should not have asked
            </p>

            <p class="tei_p">i have got along very well
            up to about 2 weeks ago and since that
            time goerge has been moody and would hardly speak only when i
                spoke to him well of course you will say mother put the worst constructions on it
                well Walt i did not the first few days i thought perhaps something had gone wrong in
                his business affairs but up to to day he has been so different from what he was ever
                since i have been home but to day he is more like
                himself Well Walt i thought of every thing sometimes i would think
                        maybee he is tired of having
                me and Edd and then i would
            think george is too noble a fellow
            for that to be the cause and i knew
            that i had not or he had not
            been to more expence than if
                he paid his board Jeffy told me
            to have a talk with george and
            ask him what made him so
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00465.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00465.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00465.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            
            but i dident like to i would ask
            him if he wasent well and so on
            but i doo hope it will go over
            i acted just the same as if i did
            not notice any change but i felt
            awful bad and what has
            made him act so god only knows
            but i believe it runs in the
            Whitman family to have such
            spells any how i hope they
            wont come often) Jeff is quite
            sick to day he was sick nearly
            all night vomiting and purging
            he has eaten very heartily
            lately he eat chicken and stuffing
            for his supper and cranberry
            pie before he went to bed and
            i think that is one great cause
            of his sickness he looks bad
            but probably it will doo him
            good to have a good clearing 
            out the rest is all well mat
            has had company 4 days this
            past week and expects the
            Doctor
            to day we had quite an
            alarm not at this house
