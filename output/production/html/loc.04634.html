            <p class="tei_p">I enclose you a map of Harleigh Cemetry,<a href="#n5b" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5b">2</a> which I though I had sent before. I have marked your lot 
                thereon as near as possible. At any time that you want any thing done to it we are at your service. 
                I thing in mentioning the matter to an architect, the lay of the ground should be particularly 
                described to him, so that he may avoid interfering with the trees. When your brain is weary please 
                put on the map the name of the spring, which is about where the star is, and when it is very active, 
                please do not forget the old tree, and name it. I have tried to put its gnarled form on paper, not 
                at all like it for fear I should interfere with your work, 
                but yet a sort of sign post to it. Below is the old willow and pine. I need not write in 
                <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">more</span>, for <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">him</span> you won't forget, and even if you

                from his cruel work to us, if there is water surrounding him to keep our 
                heated thoughts off his cool body,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">But I am a little glad myself that we have such a decent fellow to look after what we have left 
                or shall leave ourselves after having almost 
                completely used it up, and then again I look a little further, 
                clear on to resurection morn, and though I rather regret that Harleigh should be spoiled, I do believe 
                that, Christ will conquer death, and we who are laid away in Harleigh will come out to meet him, I do 
                not know exactly how, it matters not, except I will know then that 2,000,000 men are not being annually 
                murdered in Africa nor 20 million men in Europe stand ready to cut each other throat, but all will be 
                peaceful, all will be merry, all will be perfect. With both these thoughts in mind, I wish you the 
                Merriest Christmas that I can, God bless you.</p>

                    Lydia C. Wood (1845–1921) and began to develop Harleigh Cemetery on land

                    be buried in Harleigh Cemetery, in Camden, New Jersey, in an elaborate granite
                    tomb that he designed. Reinhalter and Company of Philadelphia built the tomb, at
                    a cost of $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs with money that
                    his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a summer cottage;
                    the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor, Thomas Harned.
