                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    (1833–1904) began to practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War,
                    he was in the New Jersey legislature and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned
                    actively for Horace Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S.
                    Treasury during Chester Arthur's administration. In the 1870s, Whitman
                    frequently went to Scovel's home for Sunday breakfast (Whitman's Commonplace
                    Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,

                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February

                    For other correspondence between Ryder and Walt Whitman, see Ryder's <a href="loc.00607">August 9, 1865</a>, letter to Whitman. Excerpts from
                    five of Whitman's letters to an unidentified ex-soldier (later identified as

                    to date most of the letters or to offer any initial conjectures about the identity of the recipient. 
                    However, Edwin Haviland Miller later identified the soldier as Ryder. Florence
                    Miller seems to imply that the correspondence continued into the early

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
