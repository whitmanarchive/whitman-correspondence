            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of 22 Novr.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> reached me the other day thro'
                Mr. Conway<a href="#n0170" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0170">3</a>. You no doubt will by this time have received the
                one I addressed to you 2 or 3 weeks ago; but perhaps it may occur to me to repeat
                here some things said in that letter. I think the most convenient course may be for
                me first to state the facts about my Selection.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Some while back—I suppose <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01877.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01877.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01877.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01877.002_large.jpg</span> before the middle of Septr.—Mr. Hotten<a href="#n0311" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0311">4</a>
                the publisher told me that he projected bringing out a selection from your poems,
                &amp; (in consequence of my review<a href="#n15" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r15">5</a> in the Chronicle) he
                asked whether I wd. undertake to make the selection, &amp; write any such prefatory
                    matter<a href="#n0526" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0526">6</a> as I mt. think desirable. Proud to associate myself
                in any way with your writings, or to subserve their diffusion &amp; appreciation
                here, I gladly consented.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I at once re-read thro' your last complete edition, &amp; made the selection. In
                doing this I was guided by two rules—1, to omit <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">entirely</span> every poem wh. contains <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01877.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01877.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01877.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01877.003_large.jpg</span> passages or words wh. modern

                remaining poems, those wh. I most entirely &amp; intensely admire. The bulk of poems
                thus selected is rather less than half the bulk of your complete edition; &amp;,
                before my selection went to the printer's hands, I had the advantage of revising it
                by the corrected copy you sent some while ago to Mr. Conway. I also added the prose
                Preface to Leaves of Grass—obtaining thro' Mr. Conway your permission to alter
                (or rather, as I have done, simply to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">omit</span>) 2 or 3 phrases
                in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">that Preface</span> (only). Thus my selection is a verbatim

                these 3 particulars—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">1. I have given a note here &amp; there:</p>
            <p class="tei_p">2. I have thought it better, considering the difference of a selection from the
                sum-total, to re-distribute the poems into 5 classes, which I have
                termed—Chants Democratic—Drum Taps<a href="#n0819" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0819">7</a>—Walt
                Whitman—Leaves of Grass—Songs of Parting:<a href="#n0580" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0580">8</a></p>

                are merely headed with the words of the opening line.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">The selection being thus made, I wrote a Prefatory Notice &amp; Dedicatory Letter;
                &amp; then consigned the whole affair to the publisher &amp; printer, somewhere in
                the earlier days of October. My prefatory matter, &amp; something like a third (I
                suppose) of the poems, were in print before your letter of 1 Novr.,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">9</a> addressed to Mr. Conway, reached me; &amp; now the
                Preface to Leaves of Grass is also in print, &amp; I fancy the whole thing ought to
                be completed &amp; out by Xmas, or very soon after.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The letter wh. I wrote you<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">10</a> on receipt of yours of 1 Novr.
                said that I was about to consult the <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf003v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01877.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01877.006_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01877.006_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">loc.01877.006_large.jpg</span> publisher as to dropping the mere
                selection, &amp; substituting a complete edition, only with slight verbal
                modifications. This however the publisher proved unwilling to do, the selection
                being so far advanced, advertised, &amp;c. Therefore the selection will come out
                exactly as first put together; &amp; on reflection this pleased me decidedly
                better.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I now proceed to reply to the details of your letter of 22 Novr.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If any blockhead chooses to call my selection "an expurgated edition," that lie shall
                be on his own head, not mine. My Prefatory Notice explains my principle of selection
                to exactly the same effect as given in this present letter; &amp;

            <p class="tei_p">The form of title–page wh. you propose wd. of course be adopted by me with thanks
                &amp; without a moment's debate, were it not that my own title–page was previously
                in print: I enclose a copy.<a href="#n5002f" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5002f">11</a> I trust you may see nothing in it
                to disapprove—as indeed in essentials it comes to much the same as your own
                model. However, I have already written to the publisher, suggesting that he shd.

                "the larger figures dividing the pieces into separate passages or sections," but did
                not preserve the numbers of the stanzas,—the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">separation</span> of stanzas, however, continuing as in your edition. I am sorry
                now that I did not meet your preference in this respect, &amp; that the printing has
                already proceeded too far for me to revert to the small numbers now. My wish was to

                    of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
                    Whitman's work. In 1868, Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>,
                    selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. Whitman referred
                    to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his <a href="loc.01696">August 12, 1871</a>, letter to Frederick S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
                    the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
                    remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
                    subscribers to the 1876 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising
                    for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

                    Conway often acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in
                    England. For more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway, Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    1866 after the public outcry caused Swinburne's previous publisher to withdraw.
                    Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten
                    introduced such writers as James Russell Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
                    and Bret Harte to an English audience. After his death, his business was
                    purchased by Chatto &amp; Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866,
                    William Douglas O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of Whitman: "Seems
                    to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare this." Whitman
                    was dissatisfied with Hotten's work, referring to the publisher as "the English
                    pirate-publisher" and the edition as "bad &amp; defective" in a <a href="rlc.00001">January

                    had spotted an unsigned <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> reprint of William

                        Whitman's Poems</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London Chronicle</span>,
                    July 6, 1867, 362–363). Though Walt Whitman was already aware that Rossetti was preparing a
                    London edition of his poems, he may not have yet known the
                    exact nature of Rossetti's commentary on him in the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">London
                        Chronicle</span> review because in his <a href="pml.00022">July 27, 1867</a>,
                    letter to Abby H. Price he had requested her assistance in acquiring "two or
                    three copies" of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span> reprint of Rossetti's review.
                    In the review, Rossetti described <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> as "incomparably the largest poetic work of our
                    period" (see "Current Literature," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Times</span>, July
                    28, 1867, 2). Walt Whitman had forwarded a copy of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> for "republication in England" (see his <a href="uva.00350">July 24, 1867</a>, letter to Moncure D. Conway). In his <a href="pri.00011">November 1, 1867</a>, letter to Conway, Whitman
                    stated, "I have no objection to [Rossetti's] substituting words." Whitman
                    hesitated but ultimately accepted the compromise necessary to bring his work to
                    a British public, but he later regretted acquiescing. Rossetti's expurgated
                    edition appeared as <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html">Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael

                    Rossetti justified his editorial decisions, which included editing potentially
                    objectionable content and removing entire poems: "My choice has proceeded upon
                    two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every poem which could with any
                    tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings of morals or propriety in
                    this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include every remaining poem which
                    appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest." For more information on Rossetti's

                    published in 1865. The assassination of Abraham Lincoln occurred while <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> was being printed, and Whitman promptly added
                    the short poem "Hush'd be the Camps To-day," with a note about Lincoln's death
                    to the final signature of the book. Whitman then decided to stop the printing
                    and add a sequel to the book that would more fully take into account Lincoln's
                    death. Copies of the volume were withdrawn so that the sequel could be added.
                    Whitman hastily composed several poems, adding eighteen new poems to those that
                    appeared in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span>, and all of these poems were
                    published in a second edition <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Sequel to Drum-Taps</span>
                    (1865–1866). Later, these poems were folded into <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves
                        of Grass</span>, and by the time the final arrangement of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was printed in 1881, the "Drum-Taps" cluster that
                    Whitman included in that volume contained forty-three poems. For more
