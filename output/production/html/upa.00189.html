            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 2d just <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="received​ ">rec'd</span>​  (the one from Scotland came also)—I am pretty well—full as well as when I last saw you in New York—(if any thing perhaps a little plus)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I went down last month to spend a while with the Staffords at their new farm, but I miss'd my main attraction &amp; comfort, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the Creek</span>, &amp; did not make a long visit—Mrs S and the rest are as usual, except Debbie, who was not at all hearty—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Brother &amp; sister here well—sister seems to be engaged this morning with her new girl, (who seems to be doing marvellous!) in early fall house cleaning—at any rate I noticed every thing tumbled &amp; heaped just now, as I have been down stairs to see what the post man left me—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am sitting up in my room Stevens Street writing this—copious rains all the morning, and last night—(&amp; indeed this is the third day of them)—Hattie and Jessie left for St Louis last Thursday night—Lou and I went over to the West <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phil:</span>​  depot and saw them off—(dear girls, how we miss them)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I am busy a little leisurely writing—think of printing soon a smallish 100 page book of my accumulated memoranda down at the Creek, &amp; across the Ferry, days &amp; nights, under the title of</p>

            <p class="tei_p">prose, free gossip mostly, (you saw some specimens in that Jersey letter, last winter in the <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila:</span>​  <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span>)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Isn't that sad about the sudden death of our young Mr Sartoris in your country? Something strange too (I hope nothing uncanny will turn out)—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Thank you, dear friend, for your letter—(came in just right)—how I should indeed like to see that <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cathedral</span>—I dont know which I should go for first, the Cathedral, or <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">that baby</span>—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Best love to you—to Bee, Herb, Giddy and all—I write in haste but I am determined you shall have a word at least promptly in response—</p>
