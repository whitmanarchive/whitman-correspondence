                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter has come to hand. According to request, I send you immediately a few hurr[ied] lines in response. 
                My dear loving boy, I wish things were situated so you could be with me, 
                &amp; we could be together for a while, where we could enjoy each others society &amp; sweet friendship &amp; you could talk freely. 
                I am sure it would do you good, &amp; it would be a great pleasure to me. But we must take things as they are. 
                I have thought over some passages in the letter, but will not at present say much to you on the subject, 
                in writing. One or two things I will say briefly at present—One is, that it is every way the best 
                &amp; most natural condition for a young man to be married, having a companion, a good &amp; affectionate wife—&amp; another is, that contentment with one's situation in life does not depend half so much on what that situation is, 
                as on the mood &amp; spirit in which one accepts the situation &amp; makes the best of it.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">But these are bits of cold wisdom. I must put something to you better than that in my letter. 
                So I will cheer my boy [&amp;] tell you again, Benton, that I love you dearly, &amp; always keep you in mind, 
                though we are separated by hundreds of miles. Remember this, dearest comrade, 
                when things are cloudy with you, for it is true—&amp; such thoughts are often a balm &amp; comfort to the mind.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Write to me often as you can. Don't mind because we are separated now, as things are. 
                We will meet one day, I have no doubt. Try to keep up the same brave heart in the affairs of peace, 
                that I know you did when you were a soldier. A young man's life is a battle any how. 
                Noble—thrice noble is he who steadily carries throughout the march, through defeat or whatever happens, a gay, unconquered spirit.
            </p>
