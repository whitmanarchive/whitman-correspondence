                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Whitman had come down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his
                    right lung. Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would
                    never recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel
                    Longaker of Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care
                    during his final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08298_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08298_n3"><span>Whitman is referring to
                    the bust by Sidney Morse that he sent to the minister Robert Pearsall Smith in

                    it very, very highly &amp; would give it a place of honour in my home second to

                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid
                    cyclist. Johnston was trained in Edinburgh and served as a hospital surgeon in
                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's
                    Hospital in 1917 (John Anson, "Bolton's Illustrious Doctor Johnston—a man

                    the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
                    corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
                    Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and

                    words to say of that piece of work, and really thinks that 'Our dear, dear
                    Sidney,' as he spoke of him the other day, comes nearer the 'critter,' and is
                    more faithful to the truth as it is in Whitman, than any other man who has
                    attempted to 'do' him; and he moreover declares the figor and breth of Morse's
                    work, quick with the instinct and generic quality of life. This is his last word

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
