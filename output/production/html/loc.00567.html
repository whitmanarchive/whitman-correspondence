         <p class="tei_p">Your letter in answer to my note came to hand this a.m. I
            was glad to hear from you, Walt, and hope you will continue to write often while you
            stay in Boston. It will be a good way for you to pass some
            leisure time as I do not doubt you will have plenty of it on your hands.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Walt, I am glad, very glad, you have got things fairly squared. I do not care so much
            about the style the book comes out in. I want to see it out and have no doubt the style,
            writing, &amp;c. will be no disgrace to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Boston</span>. You know I
            have always had a very high opinion of the people of the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">City of
               Notions</span>.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">I have not seen any of the folks up town, but they will undoubtedly be very glad of your
            success.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">You are well off in Boston this weather, Walt. I cannot see across the streets. The dust
            is moving in a dense mass through the streets as dust in no other city but NY can
            move.—It is actually sickening</p> 
         <p class="tei_p">I want you to look closely into the Municipal affairs of Boston, and comparing them with
            those of New York give me the conclusion you arrive at regarding their respective good
            and bad qualities.—</p> 
         <p class="tei_p">If you want to form the acquaintance of any Boston Stage men, get on one of those stages
            running to Charlestown Bridge, ov.
            Chelsea Ferry, &amp; enquire
            for, Charley Hollis, or Ed Morgan mention my name, and
            introduce yourself as my friend.— </p>
         <p class="tei_p">I am obliged to you for your kind offer of sending me a few of the sheets in advance of
            Publication, and hope you will not forget it.—</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Bob. and I had quite a long walk together in Central Park
            last Sunday. We talked much of you, and in anticipation had some long, long strolls
            together in the Park this summer It is a noble place, and Boston can no longer point
            exultingly to their common as the finest park in America</p>
         <p class="tei_p">By the way, what do you think of the common?</p>
