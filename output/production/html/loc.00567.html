            stay in Boston.<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">2</a> It will be a good way for you to pass some
            leisure time as I do not doubt you will have plenty of it on your hands.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">Walt, I am glad, very glad, you have got things fairly squared. I do not care so much
            about the style the book comes out in. I want to see it out and have no doubt the style,
            writing, &amp;c. will be no disgrace to <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Boston</span>. You know I

            success.</p>
         <p class="tei_p">You are well off in Boston this weather, Walt. I cannot see across the streets. The dust
            is moving in a dense mass through the streets as dust in no other city but NY can
            move.—It is actually sickening<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">4</a></p> 
         <p class="tei_p">I want you to look closely into the Municipal affairs of Boston, and comparing them with
            those of New York give me the conclusion you arrive at regarding their respective good
            and bad qualities.—</p>

            last Sunday. We talked much of you, and in anticipation had some long, long strolls

                    common nickname for Boston that dates at least to the first half of the

                    Boston as a center for thought and ideas due to its historical and literary
                    institutions to the suggestion that Boston earned the name because of the city's
