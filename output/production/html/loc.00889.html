                    Cavalry, was wounded in 1863. He wrote to Whitman on <a href="loc.00596">September 17, 1863</a>, from the U.S. General Hospital at Carlisle,
                    Pennsylanvia, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry." He wrote on
                        <a href="loc.00601">December 16, 1863</a>, from Culpeper, Virginia,
                    that he was doing provost duty, and on <a href="loc.00602">February 28,
                        1864</a>, he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the
                    duty is verry hard." He was wounded again on June 11 (so his parents reported to
                    Whitman on <a href="loc.00603">August 29, 1864</a>), was transported to
                    Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on August 14 to
                    Finley Hospital, where, on <a href="loc.00604">August 30, 1864</a>, he
                    wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have drempt of you
                    often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave the next day for
                    Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on <a href="loc.00882">October 22,
                        1864</a>, he wrote to Whitman from Queensbury, New York. When his parents
                    communicated with Walt Whitman on <a href="loc.00605">January 26,
                    1865</a>, Bethuel was well enough to perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one
                    of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote ten years later; see Whitman's letter to
                    Bethuel Smith, <a href="loc.02348">December 1874</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
