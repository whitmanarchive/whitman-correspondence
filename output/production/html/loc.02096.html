                    Harry Buxton Forman, was most notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley
                    and John Keats. On <a href="loc.01619">February 21, 1872</a>, Buxton sent
                    a copy of R. H. Horne's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Great Peace-Maker: A Sub-marine
                        Dialogue</span> (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying
                    of the Atlantic cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death,
                    Forman's reputation declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham
                    Pollard and John Carter published <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An Enquiry into the Nature
                        of Certain Nineteenth Century Pamphlets</span>, which exposed Forman as a
                    forger of many first "private" editions of poetry. </span></span></p></div><hr/><h3>Notes</h3><ul class="correspondence_notes"><li id="n1">1. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.02096_n1 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.02096_n1"><span>This postal card is

                    "'Good bye, my Fancy!' [...] in cloth as issued, with your name &amp; mine
                    written in it if the old indulgent mood holds, and two copies of the untrimmed
                    sheets not bound. Then I want, if it is to be had, six copies of 'A Backward
                    Glance' as printed on thin paper to be annexed to L. of G. (pocket book
                    edition)—they need not be stitched or done up any way, but on one I should
                    like your name &amp; mine on the title–leaf. There are several minor
                    works, or rather separate works, which I fancy you still have, &amp; of which
                    one copy each similarly inscribed would be very welcome: These are 'Passage to
                    India,' 'Democratic Vistas,' 'After All &amp;c.,' &amp; 'As a Strong Bird.'" He
                    also requested "the big book—Complete Poems and Prose" for his youngest
                    son, Maurice Buxton Forman, who was about to embark upon international
                    travels. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4195">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4195 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4195"><span>Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Poems &amp; Prose</span> (1888), a volume Whitman often referred to
                    as the "big book," was published by the poet himself—in an arrangement
                    with publisher David McKay, who allowed Whitman to use the plates for both <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen
                    Days</span>—in December 1888. With the help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made
                    the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach bound the
                    book, which included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. For more

                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex, called "Sands at Seventy," consisted of

                    under that title by McKay in 1891, along with a prose "Preface Note to 2d
                    Annex." Whitman concluded the 1891–92 volume with his prose essay "A
