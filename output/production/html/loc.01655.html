            <p class="tei_p">I saw the RR. smash the first thing in the paper in the morning, &amp; run my eyes over the account with fear 
                &amp; trembling—&amp; only on reading it over a second time, was I satisfied that you were not in it—poor souls! 
                for I suppose every one that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">was</span> in it, had some who heard or read the news with pain &amp; terror—some parent, 
                wife, friend, or child—poor Buchanan—but I hope, from accounts, that he will get up again, before long, 
                without serious damage—The papers here publish full, &amp; I guess very good accounts of the whole affair—I liked what the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Star</span> said so plainly—that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the cause below all others</span>, of such accidents, is because 
                they run such a route, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">over a single track</span>—you may remember my warning on the same point three years ago,

            <p class="tei_p">Pete, this spring finds me pretty much in the same tedious &amp; half-way condition I have been lingering in now 
                over two years—up &amp; around every day, look not much different, &amp; eat pretty well—but not a day passes without 
                some bad spells, sometimes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very bad</span>—&amp; never a real good night's sleep—yet still I have a sort of feeling not 
                to give it up yet—keep real good spirits—don't get blue, even at my worst spells—I am sitting here to-day as usual alone in the front room, by the window—feel pretty comfortable—the weather 
                is bright &amp; pleasant here to-day, but cool for the season, &amp; the most backward I have ever known—My sister 
                is going away for some 10 days to-morrow or next day, &amp; I shall be quite alone in the house—wish you could come 
                on &amp; pay me a visit—Would you like to have me direct any letters or papers to the American Hotel, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Baltimore​ ">Balt.</span>​  
                or shall I just direct to you at <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Washington​ ">Wash.</span>​  as usual?
            </p>

            <span class="tei_closer"><span class="tei_salute">—love to my darling son—</span>
