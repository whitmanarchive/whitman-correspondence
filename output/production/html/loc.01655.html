                wife, friend, or child—poor Buchanan—but I hope, from accounts, that he will get up again, before long, 
                without serious damage—The papers here publish full, &amp; I guess very good accounts of the whole affair—I liked what the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Star</span> said so plainly—that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">the cause below all others</span>, of such accidents, is because

            <p class="tei_p">Pete, this spring finds me pretty much in the same tedious &amp; half-way condition I have been lingering in now 
                over two years—up &amp; around every day, look not much different, &amp; eat pretty well—but not a day passes without 
                some bad spells, sometimes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">very bad</span>—&amp; never a real good night's sleep—yet still I have a sort of feeling not 
                to give it up yet—keep real good spirits—don't get blue, even at my worst spells—I am sitting here to-day as usual alone in the front room, by the window—feel pretty comfortable—the weather 
                is bright &amp; pleasant here to-day, but cool for the season, &amp; the most backward I have ever known—My sister 
                is going away for some 10 days to-morrow or next day, &amp; I shall be quite alone in the house—wish you could come 
                on &amp; pay me a visit—Would you like to have me direct any letters or papers to the American Hotel, <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Baltimore​ ">Balt.</span>​

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
