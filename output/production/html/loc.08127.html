            <p class="tei_p">Your good long letter of 19<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> came to hand yesterday afternoon—I had been at a meter meeting—all the 
                principal stock holders present—got home about 6 P.M. and found it on my desk—I am much pleased that you have had a doctor
                and I look for considerable results in increased comfort—I hope you will stick to the doctor and let him stick to you!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">When you have plate-proofs of the "goodbye" poems I hope you will send me a copy? Horace sent me a proof of "Deaths Valley" and intimated
                that it might (or not) go in the Vol. I cannot undertand you leaving it out—to my mind it is an admirable piece—most valuable.

                contains more poetry than many a vol. of so-called poems. Oh yes, I have the Round Table "Walt Whitman" by John Robertson 1884—have had it for years.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All quiet and all well here—warm outside—snow going away rapidly—roads muddy.—The meter gets on slowly but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">gets on</span>
                &amp; I have hopes will do well but there is a lot of work to do yet before we make the first million out of it.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Nothing new here—Mrs B. and self think of going east for a short holiday April or May but nothing settled yet. I have a long M.S. piece
                by J.W. Wallace on W.W.—it is scrappy but good.
