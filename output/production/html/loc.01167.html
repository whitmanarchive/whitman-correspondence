            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday on my way up to Olive to see my wife's father, who is near the end of his
                life's journey, I read in the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Tribune</span> of the death of Wm
                O'Connor.

                was news I had been expecting for some time, yet it was a stunning blow
                for all that I know how keenly you must feel it, &amp; you have

            my deepest sympathy. No words come to my pen adequate to express the sense of the
                loss we have we suffered in the death of that chivalrous &amp; eloquent soul. How strange
                that his life has all passed, that I shall see or hear him no more.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">And it is sad to me to think that he has left behind him no work or book that at all
                expresses the measure of his great powers.

            <p class="tei_p">I am pretty well, &amp; have been immersed in farm work for the past six weeks. We
                have rented our house to a New York man for 5 months. Julian &amp; I live in the old
