            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of Sunday night came this morning—it seems indeed "after a storm comes a calm"—You must have had quite an exciting week—still I think it must have been kind of good to have had George and Lou home—was Lou as kind and helpful as ever? About being alone, if you feel as I do about it, it is a satisfaction to be by one's self, as you grow old—(though perhaps not too much)—I was glad to hear about little Jim &amp; Georgey<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—I am glad the Stantons<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> are gone—they would only have been a continual nuisance—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama, I shall come home, (if nothing happens more than at present known) and stay two months, &amp; then return here to my place—I shall write in good time before—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, you must try to take as much comfort as you can—I hope Gracie<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> comes in frequently—&amp; Mrs. Mormon too—(she seems to me a good neighbor)—</p>

                    his mother described how George—"i think he is a very bad boy
                    indeed"—came to beg, and also informed her son that Nancy, Andrew's wife,
                    "said in the letter i could take george if i wanted too." According to a letter
                    from Mannahatta, Jeff's daughter, to her grandmother on October 26, 1872
                    (Library of Congress) George was killed in an accident later in the year. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00036_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller note" id="pml.00036_n2"><span>The Stantons lived

                    B. Haight. Evidently Whitman forgot, or did not know, that Haight, the daughter
                    of the Bruces (a couple mentioned in his <a href="pml.00035">January
                        23–24, 1872</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman), was in
                    Independence, Iowa, whence she wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on February 7,
                    1872 (Library of Congress). After her return to Brooklyn, she wrote to Whitman's
                    mother on September 22, 1872 (Library of Congress) and to Whitman on September
                    26, 1872 (Library of Congress). Haight and the Bruces visited Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman at Camden the day after Thanksgiving; see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
                    December 3, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman (Library of Congress). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
