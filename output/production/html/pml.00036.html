            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Your letter of Sunday night came this morning—it seems indeed "after a storm comes a calm"—You must have had quite an exciting week—still I think it must have been kind of good to have had George and Lou home—was Lou as kind and helpful as ever? About being alone, if you feel as I do about it, it is a satisfaction to be by one's self, as you grow old—(though perhaps not too much)—I was glad to hear about little Jim &amp; Georgey—I am glad the Stantons are gone—they would only have been a continual nuisance—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama, I shall come home, (if nothing happens more than at present known) and stay two months, &amp; then return here to my place—I shall write in good time before—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">Mama dear, you must try to take as much comfort as you can—I hope Gracie comes in frequently—&amp; Mrs. Mormon too—(she seems to me a good neighbor)—</p>
