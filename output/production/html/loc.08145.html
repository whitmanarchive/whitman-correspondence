                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    planning to visit Whitman on or around May 31, 1891—Whitman's
                    seventy-second (and last) birthday. The occasion was celebrated with friends at

                    that his foot, which had been sore for a couple of weeks, had become inflamed.
                    Bucke's foot was still healing, and is the reason for his lameness. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.08145_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.08145_n5"><span>Bucke is referring to his

                    Bucke of <a href="loc.08047">April 14, 1891</a>. Whitman's book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> (1891) was his last miscellany, and it
                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as
