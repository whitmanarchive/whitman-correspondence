                    In his reply, dated <a href="yal.00376">September 14</a> by Whitman,
                    Knortz wrote that Dr. Adolf Stodtmann (1829–1879) had translated eight of
                    Whitman's "smaller poems" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Amerikanische Anthologie</span>
                    (Leipzig, 1870), 149–154: "the late Doctor did not, I am very sorry to
                    say, give you a favorable introduction to the German public." Knortz also
                    informed the poet that in his "critical history of American literature . . . a
                    whole chapter (about 20 printed pages) will be devoted to your poetry." This
                    book, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Geschichte der Nord-Amerikanischen Literatur</span>, did
                    not appear until 1891. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_uva.00451_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="uva.00451_n3"><span>See the letter from
