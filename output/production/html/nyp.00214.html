            <p class="tei_p">I rec'd your letter Sunday morning last—It has been very cold here too, but is pleasant now. I sent you a copy of "Leaves of Grass"—which I suppose you have rec'd. Every thing here with me remains the same—I am free from the distress in my head—Mrs. Grayson<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> is very sick—she sent my old washerwoman, old Aunt Kitty, around this morning to see if I had any of "that bread my mother used to send me"—I suppose she meant the sweet Dyer bread—I gave her a piece a long while ago, &amp; she liked it—poor woman, I think she is on her dying bed—Mother, you must write to me how Jeff is, &amp; how he is getting along—tell Hattie I hope she will take a lesson on the piano every day, and learn to play for her Uncle Walt—so when he comes home, she can play a beautiful tune<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have been down to the Hospital a great deal lately—A friend of mine that I have known over three years, a Maine soldier named Racliffe,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> was very low with consumption &amp; bleeding at the lungs—He died Sunday morning—it was a great relief, for he suffered much—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, I believe that is all this time.</p>
