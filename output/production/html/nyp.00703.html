                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    Quaker from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the
                    Religious Society of Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until
                    1955. Hicks had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman
                    himself was a supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Specimen Days</span> (see "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">November

                    William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
                    Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
                    William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
                    various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
                    government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on
                    Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see Deshae E. Lott, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r4992">back</a>]</li></ul>
