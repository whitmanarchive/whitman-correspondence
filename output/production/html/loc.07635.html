                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina

                    letter Bucke informed Whitman that he had submitted to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Critic</span> an article entitled "One Word More on Walt Whitman." About
                    February 20, 1888, he sent the poet a letter (dated February 16) from the
                    editors of the magazine rejecting the piece: "We have printed a great many
                    'words' on Whitman, &amp; can only print 'more' when there is some specific
                    occasion for doing so—when he issues a new book, or does something to
                    attract general attention to his work" (For this rejection, see Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C., MSS18630, Box 4, Reel 2–3). On <a href="loc.07210">March 11, 1888</a>, Bucke informed Whitman that he was
                    revising his article and was considering either submitting it to <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</span> or withholding it until the
                    appearance of William Sloane Kennedy's book on Whitman, when he could include it
                    in a notice of that work. On <a href="loc.07223">August 15, 1888</a>,
                    Bucke was still working on his article and now thought to "make it into a review
                    of the new vol." Probably it became "An impromptu criticism" (see Whitman's
                    letter to Bucke dated <a href="loc.07537">December 29, 1888.</a>) </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n4111">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n4111 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n4111"><span>Jeannette Leonard Gilder
