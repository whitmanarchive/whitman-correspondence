            <p class="tei_p">Nothing special with me. Rainy &amp; dark to day—not cold. Yours rec'd with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Critic</span> letter—A letter from Mrs: Costelloe this
                mn'g—all well &amp; busy, baby growing &amp; well—I am not surprised at
                the refusal to publish in C—the opposition &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">resentment</span> at L of G. is probably as concentrated &amp; vital &amp;
                determined in New York (my own city) as anywhere, if not more vital—&amp; I do
                not count the Gilders as essentially <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">on our
                side</span>—they are smart &amp; polite but worldly &amp; conventional—as
                to the literary classes anyhow I will get a few exceptional dips out of
                them—but mainly I will have to wait for another generation—But this I
                have long known—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">—I am sitting here all alone to-day—I do not eat dinner these short
                days—only breakfast &amp; supper—my appetite fair—had some
                buckwheat cakes &amp; raw oysters for my breakfast. Shall most probably not write
                you at F[lorida] again—</p>
