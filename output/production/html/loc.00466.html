            <p class="tei_p">Mattie is still about the same—for the last two days she has suffered more with her side and back—severe and cutting pain,—than before—I wish you would write to her as soon as you get this.  I did not like to show her your last letter on account of fearing she would see and feel too badly that she could not live—she is cheerful and brave—no thing can make her despondent in the shape of personal suffering—and I do not allow her to suffer from any feeling that we feel mournful or despondent</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The children are very well indeed and good too—I am well except a bad throat and cold</p>
