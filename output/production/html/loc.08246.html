                    of Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, was a physician, photographer, and avid

                    West Bromwich for two years before moving to Bolton, England, in 1876. Johnston
                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance
                    classes for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways. He served at Whalley Military
                    Hospital during World War I and became Medical Superintendent of Townley's

                    he also wanted to be able to present copies to his friends. A version of the

                    "deathbed edition," was bound in December of 1891 so that Whitman could give the
                    volume to friends at Christmas. The following year, the 1891–1892 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> was published by Phildelphia publisher
                    David McKay. This volume reprints, with minor revisions, the 1881 text from the
                    plates of Boston publisher James R. Osgood. Whitman also includes his two
                    annexes in the book. The first annex consisted of a long prefatory essay
                    entitled "A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads" and sixty-five poems; while the
                    second, "Good-Bye my Fancy," was a collection of thirty-one short poems taken
                    from the gathering of prose and poetry published under that title by McKay in
                    1891. For more information on this volume of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves</span>, see

                    continue to worsen during the month of December 1891. On December 17, Whitman
                    came down with a chill and was suffering from congestion in his right lung.
                    Although the poet's condition did improve in January 1892, he would never
                    recover. He was confined to his bed, and his physicians, Dr. Daniel Longaker of
                    Philadelphia and Dr. Alexander McAlister of Camden, provided care during his
                    final illness. Whitman died on March 26, 1892. </span></span> [<a href="#r4c">back</a>]</li></ul>
