            anxious untill you knew) its being
            directed to george
                at the foundry
            one would suppose it was a
            business letter it came all safe
            walt in your letter you wrote sunday
            you dident say how you was getting
            along you must tell me every
            particular every time you write
            i doo want you to get well so bad
                i dont know what to doo) the time seems
            as long to me as it does to you) i feel
            as if i wanted to doo something for you
            walter dear)</p>

            <p class="tei_p">but her papa thought it was the
            next best thing for them) i was very
            glad to hear the arrangement i
            think its much better than keeping
            house poor little girls i hope their
            father will be spared to them
            hatty sent me a rose that was on poor
            mamas coffin she said) if she could
            see her dear grandma) every few lines
            she would say how her dear mama
            talked so much about grandma</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i think by what i have heard them
            speak of mr and mrs buckley they
            are very good folks) i think  jeffy
            takes his bereavement very hard)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">i have got a letter to day from
                mary we wrote to her of matty death  
            she says if she lives she will come and
            see me she felt very bad about your
                ilness but hoped you had got over it
            she wants you to come to see them i wish
            dear wal<span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_wr">t</span> you and i could go down
            there when it comes hot weather i think
