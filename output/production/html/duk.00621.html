                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in
                    his <a href="yal.00260">January 26, 1873</a>, letter to his mother, Louisa
                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office.

                    Louisa Van Velsor Whitman corresponded regularly with Abby Price's daughter
                    Helen Price in Brooklyn. Walt Whitman and Louisa knew Abby and her husband
                    Edmund Price from their move to Brooklyn in 1856. During the 1860s, Abby Price
                    and her family, especially Helen, were friends with Walt and his mother. Helen's
                    reminiscences of Walt Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's
                    biography, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay,
                    1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to her
