            <p class="tei_p">i feel as if i must
            write a few lines
                every time i get a
            letter i cant feel satisfied untill i
            write sometimes i think its real
            foolish to write every week but
            if i dont it seems as if i had something
            to doo that i had neglected my wrist
                hurts me so bad i have got Jeffs gold
            pen i dident know but it would
            help me along but iam so afraid of
            injuring it that i dont know as it
            will doo me much good) i got your
            letter Walt and money to day all right
            it is very warm here now for the
            time of year but very muddy i
            never go out any where except around
            the door i am midling well sometimes
            i think im real sick but it goes over
            i have been troubled with a pain in my
            side i have had a mustard plaister on
                part of the time i thought it helpt me some
                
            but i feel my age more this winter
            than i ever did before of course im older
            but i seem to be so tired every day the
            children annoy me very much there is
            no time to read nor any quiet they almost

            live up stairs i like them of course but
            i get very tired of them they are very wild
            and noisy matty has no help at present
                but is to have a colored girl on monday
                they expect the masons here next week to
                make a visit) george was up to day as usual
            he seldom misses he comes up in the lumber
            waggon he has put his houses in an agents
            hands to sell he says he feels real poor
            they owe considerable but if they sell i suppose
            they will come out square and not much more
            every thing is so costly the plumbing and painting
            and they pay the most of the men 3 ½ dollars per day
            walt you may laughf at this figure three it
            looks a little like a comic picture i cant help
            but laughf myself O walt i got the
                almanacks
            i have been trying to get one
            ever since new year s i sent by Jeff and
            matt and george so many times i told
            them at last i was going to send to washington
            i wanted to see about the moon and the sun
            rising and all) i am going to try to write a letter
            to mary i expect she thinks we have all forgotten
                her as to han
                i dont know as i shall ever get
            a letter from her i will try to write to
            her before long) write walt how you like
            your new boarding house
                and O the poor
            soldiers i doo so hope that poor fellow will live
                it is so sad to suffer so much)
            i think walt Jeffs
            visit yes it has done him good</p>
