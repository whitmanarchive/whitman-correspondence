                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a

                    mustard paste that was applied to a cloth or paper, which was then applied to
                    skin, generally with an intervening layer of cloth or paper. The paste,
                    sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
                    pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or
                    painful area. Mustard, a strong irritant, would produce blisters if allowed to

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                        1863</a> letter to Walt). Jules Mason's sister Irene was a close friend of

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
