            <p class="tei_p">Just recieved Springfield paper, with extended notices of Walt Whitman. Came
                opportunely, for Han was growing nervous not recieveing any letter or card from you. She
                sprang right up, renewed, although she is not very strong as yet. And I was glad too,
                I assure you. Han is steadily improving; rather weakly and gray, but ambitious and
                systematic.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have been dreadfull sick too, but can now breathe nearly as well as usual. Every
                body congratulates me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We was as glad to learn that you are so comfortable with widow Davis:<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> Han says

                not agreeable: have written twice, but recieved no reply.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps Geo is short of cash; still they keep the picture view from our house, with

                I have small room adjoining: that I can hear, if she needs any thing: she is down
                stairs every day—cooks, I make fire etc—Han sends
                love—talks of you.</p>
