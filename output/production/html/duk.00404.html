            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Just recieved Springfield paper, with extended notices of Walt Whitman. Came
                opportunely, for Han was growing nervous not recieveing any letter or card from you. She
                sprang right up, renewed, although she is not very strong as yet. And I was glad too,
                I assure you. Han is steadily improving; rather weakly and gray, but ambitious and
                systematic.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I have been dreadfull sick too, but can now breathe nearly as well as usual. Every
                body congratulates me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We was as glad to learn that you are so comfortable with widow Davis: Han says
                    she would so like
                to see her and talk with her: and so <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00404.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00404.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00404.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> would I tell her so. My father was
                a sea captain; sailed from Philadelphia to France was wrecked, lost at sea: <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">rember​ </span><span class="tei_corr">remember​
        
      </span></span> both of us to her: But what is the matter with Geo and Lou. I sent a small
                painting to them some months ago, framed, at 15 dollars with request to return it if
                not agreeable: have written twice, but recieved no reply.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Perhaps Geo is short of cash; still they keep the picture view from our house, with
                the Lake (Battery view) where you used to stroll. <span class="unclear margins cut off tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_margins tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_off tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_aa">Warm</span> Han has large room up stairs to herself.
                I have small room adjoining: that I can hear, if she needs any thing: she is down
                stairs every day—cooks, I make fire etc—Han sends
                love—talks of you.</p>
