            <p class="tei_p">First begging your pardon &amp; hoping "I dont intrude" (yet knowing I do)—I am
                writing for the magazine market—or rather have written—a reminiscence of
                the actors &amp; plays &amp; "the old Bowery" of my youthful days—the chief
                figure in it being your father—by far the greatest histrion I have ever seen
                in my life (&amp; I have always been a theatre goer)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">What I write to you now for, I want a good characteristic portrait of your father
                either in citizen's costume, or, (if <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very good</span>) in one of his
                dramatic characters, to wood-engrave an illustration from—say to make a
                picture to fill <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="about​ ">ab't</span>​  the size of one of the Harper's Magazine pages. Can you help me
                to it? </p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am disabled <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="cooped​ ">coop'd</span>​  up here, &amp; can't get about to get things for myself—or
                I wouldn't trouble you—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Won't you allow me to send you an autograph copy of my "Leaves of Grass" as a nibble
                at recompense?</p>
