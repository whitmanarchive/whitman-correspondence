                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
                    see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    letter is likely Horace Traubel, who had written to Whitman on the morning of
                    January 23, 1891, to ask for photographs of the poet. Traubel planned to travel
                    to New York and wanted to bring photos to give to the poet's New York friends.
                    Traubel notes that Whitman had, "slipped a card under the string, along with a
                    memorandum–which [Traubel] immediately took as warrant to write to Somerby
                    an order of 40 copies" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/7/med.00007.202.html">Friday, January 23, 1891</a>). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07894_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07894_n2"><span>Whitman's book <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Good-Bye My Fancy</span> (1891) was his last miscellany, and it
                    included both poetry and short prose works commenting on poetry, aging, and
                    death, among other topics. Thirty-one poems from the book were later printed as
                    "Good-Bye my Fancy" in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    (1891–1892), the last edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
