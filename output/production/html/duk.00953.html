                often &amp; live on bread &amp; honey—get out in wheel chair at sunset &amp; 
                after—get to the Delaware shore as before—the last two evenings have enjoy'd
                steady damp cool S W breezes very refreshing—have rec'd from Addington
                Symonds his two new vols: 
                "Essays Speculative &amp; Suggestive"—one
                of the essays "Democratic Art, with reference to W W"—of course the

                enclose Dr Bucke's last, just rec'd—also 
                other things—I am sitting here in my den in the big old rattan chair
                writing this—if you see Baxter tell him I have rec'd his note &amp; entirely
