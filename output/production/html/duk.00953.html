                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
                    form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
                    with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
                    was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For

                    Hartmann "has sent me a MS. for [Boston] Herald called 'A Lunch with Walt
                    Whitman,' worse than the N. Y. Herald yarn of two years ago, or so, in its
                    mischief–making potency. It consists of cheap tattle, with malicious and
                    ill–natured flings at prominent men." Baxter is comparing Hartmann's new
                    piece with his article "Walt Whitman. Notes of a Conversation with the Good Gray
                    Poet by a German Poet and Traveller," which had been published in the New York
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Herald</span> on April 14, 1889. Whitman expressed his
                    disapproval of Hartmann's 1889 article in his letter to William Sloane Kennedy
                    of <a href="duk.00920">May 4, 1889</a>. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
