                well. He had a very bad foot wound, &amp; I should judge it something that would
                deteriorate his health &amp; more or less incapacitate him through life

                    proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was quoted: "I am of
                    opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during the war
                    accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr. Whitman"
