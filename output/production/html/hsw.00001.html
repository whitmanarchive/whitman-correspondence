            <p class="tei_p">I knew Reuben Farwell as a first-class soldier (it was in
                1863 or '64) of a Michigan Regiment—he was in Ward
                A, Armory Square Hospital, Dr Bliss Superintendent—I was with him off &amp; on some months &amp; remember the case perfectly
                well. He had a very bad foot wound, &amp; I should judge it something that would
                deteriorate his health &amp; more or less incapacitate him through life
                afterward—till his death—&amp; even toward that event—which as I
                understand occurred about a year ago. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> I strongly recommend the granting a pension to his widow Ann E. Farwell.</p>
