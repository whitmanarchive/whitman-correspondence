                    7, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter September 30, 1871, and Edwin
                    Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
                    2:369). Bucke's and Miller's date is incorrect because the letter states that
                    the "green porters has left early this morning." The "green porters" are the
                    family of Mary (Whitman) Van Nostrand, who lived in Greenport, Long Island. In
                    late September 1871, Louisa's daughter Mary, Mary's husband Ansel, and their two
                    daughters Louisa and Mary Isadore "Minnie" came to Brooklyn and shopped in
                    preparation for Minnie's marriage. This letter must follow Louisa's <a href="tex.00180">October 5, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman, in which
                    she reported that her "company is here yet and i dont know how long they will
                    remain." Since Louisa did not mention the Van Nostrands in her <a href="duk.00604">October 10, 1871</a> letter to Walt, this letter dates
                    to the Saturday between the October 5 and the October 10 letters, October 7,
                    1871. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
