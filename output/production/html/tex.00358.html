            <p class="tei_p">I am not overfond of letter-writing—rather hate it indeed—I am so
                overburdened with correspondence that I neglect half of it—nevertheless let me
                hope that I answered your last of September 14 '76—&amp; that it
                    miscarried. I am very glad to hear that you are so
                improved in health, that you move about the fields &amp; woods freely &amp; have
                enjoyment of your life.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">As to myself I am pretty well for my time of life—sixty nine on the sixth of
                this month—but somewhat troubled about my eyes—for I am not only the
                shortest-sighted man in England—but have a great black island floating in each
                eye, &amp; these blacknesses increase with increasing years. However my oculist
                informs me that I shall not go blind, &amp; bids me as much as possible spare my
                eyes, neither reading nor writing too much.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My wife is still an invalid &amp; forced to lie on the sofa all day but still I trust
                somewhat stronger than when I last wrote to you.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">My younger son Lionel (whom you inquire about) was married to the daughter of F.
                    Locker (the author of London Lyrics) in <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="February​ ">Feby</span>​ —the wedding was celebrated in our old grand historical Abbey of
                Westminster—there was a great attendance of literati &amp;c of all which I
                read an account in one of your New-York papers—every third word a lie!
                Trübner wrote to me this morning, stating that you wished to see a parody of
                yourself, which appeared among other parodies of modern authors in a paper called
                'The London'—I have it not or I would sent it you. Goodbye, good friend. I
                think I have answered all your questions.</p>
