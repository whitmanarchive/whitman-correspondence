            <p class="tei_p">Yours of 22d rec'd—I send the little German trans:
                from Zurich (At y'r leisure, give me a sort of English abstract of Knortz's and
                Rolleston's prefaces in front)—I am quite
                unwell—Dr B[ucke] will probably be here to-morrow evn'g—I have rec'd a
                letter f'm Sarrazin Paris—he has the big 
                "complete" book—his book
                (with L of G. &amp;c article) will be out soon &amp; he will send me one, wh' I will
                lend you—I suppose you rec'd the Dr B trans: of S I sent—</p>
