                    23rd from which I was more than glad to learn that
                you were then in impr<span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_damage tei_gap_quantity_4 tei_gap_unit_chars">[damage]</span> health. I have also received <span class="tei_gap tei_gap_reason_cut tei_gap_reason_away tei_gap_quantity_1 tei_gap_unit_chars">[cut away]</span> good letter from Horace Traubel
                (written on Xmas day) in which he says that Christmas Eve found you in notably good
                trim &amp; relieved from many of your discomforts of the past few months. This is
                indeed good news for me, for Mr Wallace &amp; for all your
                friends here, who join me most heartily in congratulating you upon the improvement
                &amp; in the earnest hope that it may continue—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">We have had two magnificent days here, <span class="unclear cut away tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_cut tei_unclear_reason_away tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_bbb">thin</span> frost, bright sun shine, blue skies, a slight fall of
                snow last night following a really fine sunset; luminous starlight nights. I have
                been longing for a vigorous tramp over the hills &amp; fells, to taste the "caller
                    air" &amp; to enjoy the rural delights I love so
                well. But alas! I am chained to the town by inexorable duty—which <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> help me to do more than I can tell you—and sick
                folks are numerous at this time of the year—But my work has its compensations

            <p class="tei_p">Yesterday afternoon I had a walk through our Bolton Park where, save for the
                flute-like notes of a solitary blackbird and the cheery chirrups of a few sparrows,
                an ominous silence prevailed in the blackened leafless trees; &amp; I fear that the
                six weeks' frost &amp; snow have been fatal to a great many of our woodland
                songsters.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This afternoon I had an hour's skating &amp; very <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">exhilirating​ </span><span class="tei_corr">exhilarating​

                &amp; trees with his white rime, transforming them into silver filagree work. The
                afternoon was beautifully fine &amp; sunny &amp; this evening the children's party I
                mentioned in a previous letter comes off. About 50 prettily dressed little boys
                &amp; girls have just had "high tea," to which they have done ample justice, &amp;
                the general jollification &amp; juvenile revelry are now at their height. There are
                games, romps, dances, bon bons, crackers, Magic Lanterns, &amp; mirthful fun of all
                sorts in which I have been participating &amp; what is better, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">enjoying</span> as much as the youngest of them!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Oh that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span> could come &amp; join our merry throng, as "the
                Carpenter" came to old Elkanah Dyzer's place &amp; see
