                    <p class="tei_p">Between December 26 and 29, 1864, Whitman sent copies of his article "The
                        Prisoners" to several newspaper editors, including the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> and the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York

                    general exchange of prisoners was born from his inability to effect a special
                    exchange for his brother George, who, Whitman had told Ellen M. O'Connor in a
                    letter dated <a href="nyp.00194">December 4, 1864</a>, "still remains a
                    prisoner—as near as we can judge he is at Columbia, S C—we have had
                    no word from
                    him—." </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
