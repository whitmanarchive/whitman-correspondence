                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Poet,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been home and back again since I called upon you in Philadelphia last month. I
                often think of you and wish I could stay near you, that I might see and speak to you
                sometimes, however, I often read your poems and as Shelley has said, "Poetry is the
                record of the greatest happiest moments, of our greatest and best minds." Therefore
                in reading your book I feel that I have that which is greatest in you, but the heart

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf001v" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00026_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00026_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">syr_kc.00026_large.jpg</span>

            will often rebel against the most logical conclusion, and thus with me I would like
                to be near you sometimes. I have only one other friend who has the same power over
                me, and that is he of whom I told you in Halifax. I was rather amused (when I told
                some of my friends at home that I had seen you), at the ideas they seemed to have of
                my object in calling on you. Some thought it was simply because you were a great
                man, and they gave me addresses of several well known men in Literature &amp;c.
                however, I told them

            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fsyr_kc.00027_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fsyr_kc.00027_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">syr_kc.00027_large.jpg</span>

            these other men were not Walt Whitman and that the only others I would have crossed
                the Atlantic to see would have been <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Emerson</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Thoreau</span> both of whom are very dear to me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You may have forgotten all about me: indeed it would be surprising to find it
                otherwise; but it was not that you should know me, that I came, no—I both <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">knew &amp; loved</span> you before, but I wanted to see &amp;
                speak to you. It might have been my friend as well as myself who called but I had
                the opportunity.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I send you a book, that a friend in Glasgow, who is greatly taken with your "Leaves
                of Grass" asked me to send to you or take. I cannot very well leave my ship just
                now so I post it to you, he would have liked to have sent a more valuable

            book but he cannot afford it. I thought it very kind of him, I know he is a dear
                soft hearted fellow, and a splendid critic of English Literature. I will be here for
                8 days, and I would like very much to know if you are well.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am glad to be able to tell you that your number of readers in Scotland is
                greatly increased. They are beginning to understand your teaching much better</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I heard that Swinbourne
                ranks you third of living men. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Victor Hugo</span> I know is his
                great hero.</p>
