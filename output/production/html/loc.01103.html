                    Asenath was born and grew up in Cayuga, New York, and by the age of eighteen,
                    she was married to Newton Benedict (ca. 1824–1888). The Benedicts moved to

                    clerks; they also opened their home to boarders, who were similarly employed.
                    The Benedicts were Whitman's landlords at 472 M North, having replaced Juliet
