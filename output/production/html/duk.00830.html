                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander

                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    as the United States Pension Agent at Boston between 1894 and 1898. Lovering was

                    On January 19, Walt Whitman noted the introduction of Lovering's bill, which was
                    to grant the poet a pension of $25 a month (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
                    Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
                    Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On February 4 he replied to a letter
                    from Lovering (Whitman's Commonplace Book); both letters are apparently
                    lost. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
