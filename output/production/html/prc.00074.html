            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Your good letter has come, &amp; I am glad indeed to hear from you, &amp; sister
                &amp; father, &amp; have you <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">located</span>—All sorrowful,
                solemn, yet soothing thoughts come up in my mind at reminiscences of my dear friend,
                your dear mother<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a>—have often thought of you all,
                since '73 the last time I saw you so briefly—so sadly—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">About Dr Bucke—(he is a long-established <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">medical doctor</span>
                &amp; head of the Asylum for the Insane, at London, Ontario, Canada)—you can
                write to him freely &amp; send him what you feel to—he is a true &amp; trusted
                friend of mine—I know him well<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just returned from Boston, where I have been the past week—went on to
                read my annual <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Death of Abraham Lincoln</span> on the anniversary of
                that tragedy—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am pretty well for me—am still under the benumbing influences of paralysis,
                but thankful to be as well as I am—still board here (make my head quarters
                here) with my brother &amp; his wife—Eddy, my brother, is living &amp; well,
                he is now boarding ab't 40 miles from here<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>—Yes,
                Helen dear, when I come to New York, I will send you word sure—Best love to
                you, Emmy, father &amp; all, especially little Walter<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—</p>
