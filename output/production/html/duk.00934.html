                weather—sun out this forenoon, but now dark—I sit here the same as ever,
                alone mostly, in the great chair—two massages or pummelings—&amp; two

                &amp; brain well shatter'd &amp; gone (that secession war experience was a <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">whack</span> or series of whacks irrecoverable)—have sold a
                big book &amp; sent it off to Chicago to-day—have
                been out to-day in wheel-chair a short jaunt—Lord bless you all—</p>
