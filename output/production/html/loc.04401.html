            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">I wrote to you last evening, &amp; after a short letter to Traubel spent the rest of the evening in chatting with Mr
                &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">rs</span> Rome—about old memories of you, the changes in Brooklyn, persons &amp; places in 
                Annan, Scotland &amp;c.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">This morning we had breakfast a little after 7, &amp; M<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">r</span> Rome &amp; son went to business. I followed them
                shortly after to see if there was
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc_vm.01004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc_vm.01004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                any letter there for me. I was glad at heart when Andrew Rome gave me a letter from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>. Tom Rome came up
                at the same time &amp; Andrew introduced us. After a very brief talk I opened your letter &amp; read it aloud to them both. How
                wonderfully it fitted in! How could it have been better? Through me you addressed a message of grateful &amp; affectionate memories
                &amp; love to them both—&amp; there I received it in their actual presence, &amp; without knowing its contents read it aloud to them
                both! You should have seen the look that came into

                their faces—as of a tender veil of mist over silent granite rocks. And before I came away Andrew Rome said he would try to come
                with me to Camden when I come—coming in the morning, returning at evening.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">He came out with me &amp; took me to Cranberry St—to the old office where you printed the Leaves. (Room now occupied by a bookbinder.)
                I stood a little in front of the window where you set the type—&amp; in the corner where you used to sit to read the "Tribune" when
                you called in each morning.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then he went back to business &amp; I went down to the Fulton Ferry. I crossed &amp; came back again—reading your poem again, &amp;
                observing &amp; absorbing all I could. I find that your friend, John Baulson
                has given up work as

                pilot—"gave it up a month ago of his own accord," the man said.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I walked across the Bridge &amp; spent a little time in New York &amp; then came back to dinner as promised. Am now writing letters, &amp; by
                the time I have done Rome will come back here for a walk in Brooklyn with me.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Then I propose to go to Huntington, Long Island, for the week end—to visit West Hills &amp;c. Will perhaps come back Sunday night or
                Monday morning—but should like to stay till Monday night, &amp; may perhaps do so. Then another day or so in N.Y. before coming
                on—but will write to you again.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A. H. R told me at dinner that he met Ex-mayor Stryker this morning. They spoke about you, &amp; R. said he hoped to see you 
                soon, &amp; S. commissioned him to convey his regards.
