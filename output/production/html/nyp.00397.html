                    Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
                    his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s <a href="nyp.00157">January 9, 1864</a>,
                    letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H

                    Whitman on <a href="nyp.00176">January 12, 1865</a>, thanking him for his
                    letter (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find
                    words to tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live
                    to meet again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere
                    there is no more parting." Millis, Jr. later moved to Delaware, where he

                    suffered a paralytic stroke that made walking difficult. He first reported it in

                    Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873), and continued to provide regular notes on
                    his condition. By mid-March Whitman was taking brief walks out to the street and
                    began to hope that he could resume work in the office. See also his <a href="med.00418">March 21, 1873</a>, letter to his mother. </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li></ul>
