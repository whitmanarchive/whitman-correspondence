                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
                    see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    10, 1890, Bucke suffered a fall in which he injured his right arm. That same
                    day, he wrote Horace Traubel: "I am over my eyes in work and my right arm is
                    helpless and painfull—it keeps me from getting good rest at night so that
                    I am not in the best of trim by day." </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n8">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07842_n8 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="loc.07842_n8"><span>Whitman is referring to the
                    lecture in his honor, which would take place on October 21 at Philadelphia's
                    Horticultural Hall. The New York jeweler John H. Johnston and the Canadian
                    physician Richard Maurice Bucke planned the event, and the orator and agnostic
                    Robert Ingersoll delivered the lecture: "<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberty in
                        Literature. Testimonial to Walt Whitman</span>." See Ingersoll's <a href="loc.02350">October 12</a> and <a href="loc.02351">October

                    Philadelphia to the orator and agnostic Robert G. Ingersoll's (1833–1899)
                    lecture in honor of Whitman aroused the wrath of the Whitmanites, although they
                    secretly delighted in the opportunity to battle with the "enemy." Bucke, who had
                    wanted a New York lecture, sputtered on <a href="loc.07115">September
                        28</a>, "Now I am in favor of Phila for the sake of the dear Pharisees
                    there. If I were down East and assisting to run the thing I would give them (at
                    least try to give them) a dose that they would remember and that would do them
                    good." He returned to the subject on <a href="loc.07116">September 30</a>:
                    "Chaff the Pharisees and tell them to 'come on!' Lord how dear old [William]
                    O'C[onnor] would be tickled to be in the middle of the thing!" </span></span> [<a href="#r7">back</a>]</li></ul>
