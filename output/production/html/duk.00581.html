            well walt i have had a letter from
            matty<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> the other day they seem to be all getting
                along finely matty sent me two 25 cent bills<a href="#n12" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r12">8</a>
            quite a lift wasent it walt well walt i dont want
            to complain of any body but i doo think sometimes
            they might send me a few dollars but to send
            50 cents i thought it rather small when i think
            of what i have done for them i dont think
            i would be indebted if they was to
            send me considerable) Jeff<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">9</a> sent a letter to
            George after he left for camden wanted an
            immediate answer) now walt i will tell you
            all about the affairs between george and jeff
            i think you will understand it in the first place
            jeff let george have 500 dollars<a href="#n15" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r15">10</a>
            george gave him a note
            forit and then he let him have 500 hund more he gave him
            a note for that that made 1000 dollars one was given 
            last august and the other last september and when
                matt was on here
                george lent her 50 dollars<a href="#n14" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r14">11</a> she told
            jeff to pay george but he dident so george thought
            it could go to pay the interest of the notes or toward
            it) when jeff was on i said to him couldent he
            let george have what money he would want to
            build with and take a mortgage on this house i
            thought it would be an advantage to jeff as well
            as george so he asked george how much he would
            want and george told him three thousand dollars
            jeff said he would let him know when he went
            back and george said when the other house was
            sold he would pay off the two notes and only 
            have the three thousand stand well jeff sent
            drafts at different times till he had sent it all
            but 600 dollars<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">12</a>
            that was to make out the mortgage
            you see walt and then he stopped dident send
            any more finally the mortgage was made out
            and executed and left at the recorders office
            and six hundred wasent received so when george
            was home he said that six hundred he should
            keep to pay you<a href="#n13" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r13">13</a> 
            and when the house was sold
            he should have some coming and would make
            up enoughf to pay off the notes to jeff) well this
                letter to george was to see if george couldent pay
                the notes off as  jeffy wanted to go into some speclulation
            in an iron furnace manufactory but he said for
            george to not sell the house by any means
            so i wrote a letter to him that george was away
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a id="leaf002r" href="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00581.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00581.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00581.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span><span class="page_image_description">duk.00581.003.jpg</span>

                    23, 1869. June 23, the date in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, fell on a
                    Wednesday in 1869, the year assigned to the letter by Richard Maurice Bucke. In
                    the letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote that John Burroughs had visited her
                    "yesterday tuesday." Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:367). Louisa's summary of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
                    loans to George Washington Whitman—he received the first loan of $500
                    "last august"—is consistent with Jeff Whitman's <a href="loc.00448">August 20, 1868</a> letter to George and further confirms the year of

                    you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January

                    Whitman wanted his brother George Washington Whitman to sell the mortgage on the
                    Steers property and repay him $1,000, which would allow Jeff to invest in
                    the iron furnace manufacturer. George could not sell the Steers property because
                    he had already transferred the mortgage note to the mason. Louisa was probably
                    frustrated that Jeff's demand for an immediate payment altered the terms that
                    George had expected. Jeff initially agreed to lend George $1,000 and had
                    agreed to lend an additional $3,000 in exchange for a mortgage. But Jeff had
                    only sent George $2,400 toward the mortgage. Now Jeff wanted to be repaid
                    the initial $1,000 immediately and ceased making monthly $200 payments
                    on the promised $3,000 while $600 short of $3,000. Because Louisa
                    was writing to Walt Whitman, she was probably implying that George should first
                    repay the $600 loan to Walt (above George "said that six hundred he should
                    keep to pay you") because Jeff had not sent George the full amount to which he
                    had agreed and told George not to sell the house: Jeff, Louisa implies, could
                    wait until George sold another house to be repaid the initial $1,000 in
                    full. Louisa like George wanted the $1,000 to remain outstanding. By
                    recasting George's loan of $50 to Mattie at Christmas as a servicing payment
                    for Jeff's initial $1,000 loan, George could be considered to have paid
                    interest due on the loan. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n13">16. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n13 note" id="duk.00425_n13"><span>Edward Whitman
                    (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van

                    significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
