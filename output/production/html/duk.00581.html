            well walt i have had a letter from
            matty the other day they seem to be all getting
                along finely matty sent me two 25 cent bills
            quite a lift wasent it walt well walt i dont want
            to complain of any body but i doo think sometimes
            they might send me a few dollars but to send
            50 cents i thought it rather small when i think
            of what i have done for them i dont think
            i would be indebted if they was to
            send me considerable) Jeff sent a letter to
            George after he left for camden wanted an
            immediate answer) now walt i will tell you
            all about the affairs between george and jeff
            i think you will understand it in the first place
            jeff let george have 500 dollars
            george gave him a note
            forit and then he let him have 500 hund more he gave him
            a note for that that made 1000 dollars one was given 
            last august and the other last september and when
                matt was on here
                george lent her 50 dollars she told
            jeff to pay george but he dident so george thought
            it could go to pay the interest of the notes or toward
            it) when jeff was on i said to him couldent he
            let george have what money he would want to
            build with and take a mortgage on this house i
            thought it would be an advantage to jeff as well
            as george so he asked george how much he would
            want and george told him three thousand dollars
            jeff said he would let him know when he went
            back and george said when the other house was
            sold he would pay off the two notes and only 
            have the three thousand stand well jeff sent
            drafts at different times till he had sent it all
            but 600 dollars
            that was to make out the mortgage
            you see walt and then he stopped dident send
            any more finally the mortgage was made out
            and executed and left at the recorders office
            and six hundred wasent received so when george
            was home he said that six hundred he should
            keep to pay you 
            and when the house was sold
            he should have some coming and would make
            up enoughf to pay off the notes to jeff) well this
                letter to george was to see if george couldent pay
                the notes off as  jeffy wanted to go into some speclulation
            in an iron furnace manufactory but he said for
            george to not sell the house by any means
            so i wrote a letter to him that george was away
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00581.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00581.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00581.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
            and would be home in 2 weeks and that he
            had transfered the 1000 dollar mortgage on the
                steers property to the mason that done the work) jeff
            wrote to know if george held that mortgage yet
            so i dont know how it go)
                if you cant understand
            walter dear you must read it over two or three
            times) when matt wrote to me she generally
            asks how walt is and they would like to have
            you come on there well i dare say they would
            well i said in my letter to matt walt seems
            quite well now and the same good old standby
            sends edd and me our daily substance i
            thought afterwards maybe they would think
            it was a hint to them but i thought i dident care
                good bie Walter it will bring it near  september
            if you dont come till two months well
            <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00581.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Fduk.00581.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Fduk.00581.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
