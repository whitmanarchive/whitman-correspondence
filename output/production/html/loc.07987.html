                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one

                    era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
                    who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to Horace
                    Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>. He lives, embodies, the

                    death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
                    was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see

                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    and one son, Wallace (1893–1898). Anne was unimpressed with Whitman's work
                    when she first read it, but later became enraptured by what she called its
                    "pulsating, illumined life," and she joined Horace as associate editor of his
                    Whitman-inspired periodical <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Conservator</span>. Anne edited

                    Horace's death, both Anne and Gertrude edited his manuscripts of his
                    conversations with Whitman during the final four years of the poet's life, which

                    nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
                    of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a former sea captain who
                    went blind, and Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and

                    was the twenty-third U.S. president and grandson of the ninth president, William
                    Henry Harrison. Harrison was the Republican nominee who defeated Democratic
                    incumbent Grover Cleveland in 1888. </span></span> [<a href="#r4269">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">15. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.07987_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.07987_n5"><span>President Benjamin Harrison
                    spent the summer of 1891 in a cottage at Cape May Point at the southern tip of
                    New Jersey; the cottage was a gift to Harrison's wife Caroline from the
                    mercantilist John Wanamaker of Philadelphia. Harrison used the Congress Hotel in
                    Cape May—a favorite vacation spot for former U.S. presidents—as the
                    first "summer White House," since the actual White House was undergoing
                    renovations involving the installation of electricity. </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n7006">16. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_n7006 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="n7006"><span>The Costelloes were Benjamin

                    of Robert Pearsall Smith (1827–1898). Smith, an evangelical minister, and
                    his wife Hannah Whitall Smith (1831–1911) had three children: Mary Whitall
                    Smith Costelloe (1864–1945), Logan Pearsall Smith (1865–1946), and
                    Alys Pearsall Smith (1867–1951). The Smith family were all friends and
