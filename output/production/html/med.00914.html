                    (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">American</span> and the Boston <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Transcript</span>; he also
                    published biographies of Longfellow, Holmes, and Whittier (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Dictionary of American Biography</span> [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1933], 336–337). Apparently Kennedy called on
                    the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William Sloane Kennedy, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> [London: Alexander
                    Gardener, 1896], 1). Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman,
                    in his first published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse
                    indecencies of language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was
                    "too coarse and crude"; see <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Californian</span>, 3 (February
                    1881), 149–158. For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    designed an elaborate granite tomb, which P. Reinhalter &amp; Co. of
                    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, built for the poet in Harleigh Cemetery in Camden,
                    New Jersey. The tomb cost $4,000. Whitman covered a portion of these costs
                    with money that his Boston friends had raised so that the poet could purchase a
                    summer cottage; the remaining balance was paid by Whitman's literary executor,
                    Thomas Harned. For more information on the cemetery and Whitman's tomb, see See
