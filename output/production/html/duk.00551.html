                    Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The

                    showing in the election on Tuesday, November 3, 1868, assured him an electoral
                    college victory, so this letter dates to the Wednesday immediately following the

                    lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
                    and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
                    years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the

                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on

                    family, especially her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt and Louisa Van

                    Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
                    you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
