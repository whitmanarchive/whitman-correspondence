                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,

                    observes that this letter "came on Sunday afternoon, March 2"—a statement
                    which may mean that Whitman wrote it on that day or that the letter reached
                    Burroughs on Sunday afternoon. The former is more plausible. Burroughs' letter
                    of <a href="loc.01175">February 27, 1890</a> reveals that he was still
                    depressed, living separate most of the time from his wife, and nostalgic." On

                    Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Solitary Singer</span> [New York: New York University Press,

                    one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
