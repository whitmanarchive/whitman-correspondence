            <p class="tei_p">Yours came yesterday and welcomed. I am here yet and
                allowing for the wear and decay-change, the situation continues much the same. You
                know I am well on my 71st year—lame and almost helpless in
                locomotion—inertia like a heavy swathing ample dropping pall over me most of
                the time, but my thoughts and to some extent mental action ab't the same as ever
                (queer ain't it?)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have had my daily mid-day massage (another just as I go to bed). Tho't of going out
                a little in my wheel chair but it is bitter cold today here and I shall not. I have
                just sent a half-page poem to Gilder, they have accepted, paid,
                proofed it, and I believe it will be out in May number.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have just had a drink of milk punch—am sitting at present in my two-story den
                in Mickle St, alone as usual, more buoyant than you might suppose</p>
