                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
                    Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
                    Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
                    B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
                    English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
                    including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
