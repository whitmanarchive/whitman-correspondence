            <p class="tei_p">Cloudy to-day &amp; some breeze, but hot wave continued—begins to tell on
                me—sitting at this moment in the customary place by the window middling
                comfortable—you must be near shore—Suppose you (by this gets to you,)
                have given my best affectionate regards to my friends there, the Costelloes, the Smiths, the dear Bolton folks &amp; all—Tom Harned here
                last evn'g—he &amp; folks well—God bless you—</p>
