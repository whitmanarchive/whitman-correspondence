                    and Charles Merriam (1806–1887) were booksellers in Springfield,
                    Massachusetts. They established a publishing company called G &amp; C Merriam,
                    Co. in Springfield in or about 1831 (some sources cite 1833). Following the
                    death of the lexicographer Noah Webster (1758–1843), they acquired the
                    rights to Webster's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">An American Dictionary of the English
                        Language</span> from J. S. and C. Adams. They proceeded to release revised and
                    updated versions (as well as quarto and university editions) throughout the next
                    four decades. Merriam's younger brother Homer would later join them in this
                    effort. Today, the Merriam brothers' company exists as Merriam-Webster and
                    continues to publish editions of Merriam-Webster's Dictionary. For more
                    imformation on the Merriams and their company, see G &amp; C Merriam Co. records

                    Whitman returned to Brooklyn, he became the editor of a political newspaper
                    called the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Freeman</span>. Although Whitman's
                    association with the free-soil paper lasted only a year, his
                    editorship of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Freeman</span> is notable because it includes
                    some of his most passionate antislavery journalism. Published initially with the financial
                    backing of Whitman's friend, Judge Samuel V. Johnson, the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Freeman</span> commenced publication as a weekly newspaper on September 9,
                    1848. It became a daily paper in 1849 under the new title of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn
                    Daily Freeman</span>. Only two issues of the paper are known to have survived. Despite the
                    Free-Soilers' defeat in the 1848 presidential election and again in the spring
                    of 1849, Whitman continued to publish the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Freeman</span>. Following a failed attempt to back
                    Senator Thomas Hart Benton’s run for presidency, Whitman published his
                    resignation from the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Freeman</span> on September 11,
                    1849. For more information see Jon Panish, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_390.html">"Brooklyn <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Freeman</span></a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt

                    to selling books, Newman was also a publisher. His publishing house dealt
                    primarily with school textbooks. His office at 199 Broadway was designated as
                    the place for the Merriams to send the copy of their new Webster's to Whitman. </span></span> [<a href="#r5b">back</a>]</li><li id="n6">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_prc.00152_n6 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="prc.00152_n6"><span> The dictionary finally
                    procured from the Merriam brothers (with its fine, dark Russia leather binding)
                    became Whitman’s preferred dictionary when he was writing the poems for the
