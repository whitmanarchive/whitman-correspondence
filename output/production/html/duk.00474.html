            about sending the papers Walt but i think

            time between georges coming up every day
            and the children up here nearly all the time
            but i like so to read the speakery in the house
            i read Chandlers speech and i generally see
            the sunday paper davis takes the times every
            day but he is so queer about it leaves it
            over to the office<a href="#n16" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r16">14</a>
            Jeff says for to not ask him for
            it i got your letter walt yesterday with
            the 5 dollars i feel Walt sometimes as if you
            was too liberall with me but its all i have except
            sometimes 15 or 20 cents and i pay the rent too one
            month Jeff only charged me 5 dollar matty says
            he has to pay just the same as they did before
            they took the long room Jeff is very kind to
            me i wonder sometimes he is for every little
            thing is told him even to burning a little wood
            when i ought to burn coal but i let every thing slide
            along but i think matty gets better) but we get along pretty well

                    February 11, 1867 speech by Michigan Senator Zachariah Chandler. Chandler's
                    speech, which advocated impeaching President Andrew Johnson, was published in

                    worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
                    for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
                    War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
                    nationally recognized name in civil engineering.

                    Probasco, an employee at Brooklyn Water Works, is first mentioned in Thomas

                    Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
                    Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
                    Water Works. Mattie suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her

                    army officer. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman wrote that Mason "used to be in my

                        1863</a> letter to Walt). Jules Mason's sister Irene was a close friend of

                    children of Gordon F. Mason, a prominent Pennsylvania businessman. When Jeff
                    departed for St. Louis in early May 1867, Mattie stayed at the Mason home in

                    (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
                    Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and

                    Whitman's brother and sister-in-law. This nickname is rare in Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman's letters. In Louisa's letters Jessie Louisa is most often "Sis," a
                    nickname that she inherited from her older sister Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman, or
                    "California" in deference to Walt Whitman's private nickname, which he bestowed
                    on her shortly after her birth (see Walt's <a href="loc.00805">December 15,

                    Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
                    wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
                    prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
                    George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
                    partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a

                    Whitman visited his brother Walt Whitman in Washington in mid-February 1867.
                    Jeff thereafter corresponded periodically with William D. O'Connor, and Walt
                    reported on Jeff's visit in his <a href="nyp.00257">February 19, 1867</a>

                    were to be his close associates during the Washington years. William Douglas
                    O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly, William's wife, had a close
                    personal relationship with Whitman. The correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
                    almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
