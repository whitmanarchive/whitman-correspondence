        again—nothing new with me—I am sitting in the office, writing this, Thursday
        afternoon—I keep quiet as possible—for if one stirs two steps, the sweat runs
        off him—It is 3 o'clock—there is a little air stirring to-day, but out doors it
        is like an over—John Burroughs<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> has just been in to see
        me—he comes in most every day—Mother, I hope you will not get affected by the

        31st—(but if you all are not to rights I will put it off another week.)</p>

        always disagreeable to make a great change, &amp; especially for old folks, but a little

                    infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
                    Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see

                    "Loo" or "Lou," married Whitman's brother George Whitman on April 14, 1871. Their
                    son, Walter Orr Whitman, was born in 1875 but died the following year. A second
                    son was stillborn. Whitman lived in Camden, New Jersey, with George and Louisa from
                    1873 until 1884, when George and Louisa moved to a farm outside of Camden and
                    Whitman decided to stay in the city. Louisa and Whitman had a warm relationship
                    during the poet's final decades.
