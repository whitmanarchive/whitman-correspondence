      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I suppose you got the letter last Wednesday, I sent—I have written a few
        words to Han. continues very hot here, and is now dry
        again—nothing new with me—I am sitting in the office, writing this, Thursday
        afternoon—I keep quiet as possible—for if one stirs two steps, the sweat runs
        off him—It is 3 o'clock—there is a little air stirring to-day, but out doors it
        is like an over—John Burroughs has just been in to see
        me—he comes in most every day—Mother, I hope you will not get affected by the
        heat—By accounts it must be worse in New York than anywhere else—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right">Friday noon, Aug. 23.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I just rec'd your letter—I hope by the time you get this, you will get the
          things—I want to come—perhaps about the
        31st—(but if you all are not to rights I will put it off another week.)</p>

      <p class="tei_p">When you write again tell me whether Ed has recovered his spirits—Mother, it is
        always disagreeable to make a great change, &amp; especially for old folks, but a little
        time gets things working smoothly, &amp; then one is glad of the change, &amp; better
        off—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am feeling quite well to-day—the weather is pleasanter—had a good sleep last
        night—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I think Grant stock is steadily going up, &amp; Greeley stock
        down, here &amp; every where—</p>

        <span class="tei_salute">Love to you, mama dear, &amp; to Lou &amp; all,</span>
