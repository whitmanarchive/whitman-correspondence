                    Whitman replied to this letter on April 27, 1874 (lost), Stansberry wrote again oon <a href="duk.00766">May 12, 1874</a>, 
                    about the hospital
                    visits. On <a href="duk.00767">June 28, 1874</a>, he thanked Walt Whitman
                    for his letter and "22 News Pappers." On <a href="duk.00764">July 15, 1874</a>, 
                    his wife informed 
                    Whitman of her husband's failing health and poverty and inquired about the
                    possibility of a pension. Evidently in reply to another lost letter from 
                    Whitman, Stansberry asked on <a href="duk.00768">July 21, 1875</a>, for "the Lone of
                    65$" in order to return to West Virginia, where he expected to find
                    witnesses to support his application for a pension. This was evidently the last
                    letter in the correspondence. These letters are in the Trent Collection, Duke
                    University. See also <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Complete Writings of Walt
