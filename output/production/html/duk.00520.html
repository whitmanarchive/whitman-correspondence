                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                        most likely date for this letter; however, March 13 and March 27, 1868 are
                        also possible. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter only "friday
                        afternoon." The letter may date to March 13, 1868, as suggested by Richard
                        Maurice Bucke. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver assigned the same date
                            (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt
                            Whitman and His Family</span> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
                        Press, 1949], 194), and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and Silver's date
                        (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York
                        University Press, 1961–77], 2:365). The evidence for dating the letter
                        to March 13, 1868 is indirect, and the letter more probably dates to a week
                        or two later.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">Attorney General Richard Stanberry resigned his office on March 12, 1868 to
                        serve as legal counsel during Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial. Walt
                        Whitman served as a clerk in the office of the attorney general, and Louisa
                        Van Velsor Whitman conveyed her discussion with son George Washington
                        Whitman about Walt's prospects after Stanberry was replaced. March 12, 1868,
                        a Friday, is therefore the earliest possible date for the letter. The
                        letter, however, mentions a recent letter from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
                        Whitman, and Louisa had also acknowledged a previous letter from Jeff in her
                            <a href="duk.00519">March 11, 1868</a> letter to Walt. If both of
                        Louisa's letters refer to the same letter from Jeff, March 13, 1868 is the
                        correct date. But since Louisa conveyed no news from Jeff nor from Martha
                        Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (Jeff's wife), the letter presumably acknowledges
                        a later but non-extant letter from Jeff. Because Jeff was overwhelmed with
                        work, it is unlikely that he wrote two letters to his mother within the span
                        of three days; therefore, March 20, 1868 is a more probable date for this
                        letter.</p> </span></span> [<a href="#r16">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00520_n1 note" id="duk.00520_n1"><span>Edwin Haviland Miller dated

                    1961–77], 2:360). If the present letter dates to March 20 or March 27,
                    1868, which is more likely than March 13, Walt's lost letter would also date a
                    week or two later. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n2 tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa note" id="duk.00425_n2"><span>George Washington Whitman

                    was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
                    to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
                    the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
                    Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
                    serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
                    the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
                    (see Louisa's <a href="duk.00470">May 31, 1866</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's <a href="loc.00444">May 23, 1867</a>, <a href="loc.00452">January 21,

                    (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.

                    Whitman, a frequent guest in the Burroughs household. The marriage faltered over
                    matters of sexual incompatibility, and Whitman sided with Ursula against John's
                    sexual "wantonness" and eventual infidelity. John Burroughs traveled a great

                    policies. Henry Stanbery (1803–1881) succeeded Speed, and he resigned on
