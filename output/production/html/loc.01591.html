                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">According to announcement in my last, I have made a movement &amp; change of base,
                from tumultuous, close-packed, world-like N. Y., to this half-rural, brisk,
                handsome, New England, third-class town. I came on here last Thursday. I came as
                guest of Thomas Davis, formerly M. C. from this city—arrived between 8 and 9
                o'clock at night—found his carriage at the depot waiting for me—at the
                house (a sort of castle built of stone, on fine grounds, a mile &amp; a half from
                the town) a hearty welcome from his hospitable wife, &amp; a family of young ladies
                &amp; children—a hot supper, a tip-top room &amp;c. &amp;c.—so you see,
                Pete, your old man is in clover. I have since been round the city &amp; suburbs
                considerably. I am going down to Newport before I return. Invitations &amp;c. are
                numerous. I am, in fact, already dividing myself between two hospitalities, part of
                the time with Mr. &amp; Mrs. Davis, and part with Dr. &amp; Mrs. Channing, old
                acquaintances of mine in another part of the city. I stopt last night at the house
                of the latter. It is on a high &amp; pleasant hill at the side of the city, which it
                entirely overlooks. From the window of my room, I can look down across the city, the
                river, and off miles upon miles in the distance. The woods are a real spectacle,
                colored with all the rich colors of autumn. Yesterday it was beautiful &amp; balmy
                beyond description, like the finest Indian summer. I wandered around, partly
                walking, partly in a carriage, a good part of the day. To-day there is an entire
                change of scene—As I sit writing this—what do you think,
                Pete?—great flakes of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">snow</span> are falling, quite a thick
                flurry—sometimes the wind blows gusts—in fact a real snow storm has been
                going on all the forenoon, though without the look or feeling of actual winter as
                the grass &amp; foliage are autumnal, &amp; the cold is not severe yet. Still it
                [is] disagreeable &amp; wet &amp; damp &amp; prevents me from going out. So I will
                make it up by writing a couple of letters—one to mother,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> &amp; one to you,
                telling you about things. Providence is a handsome city of about 70,000
                inhabitants—has numerous manufactories in full operation—every thing
                looks lively. From the house up here, I can hear almost any time, night or day, the
                sound of factory bells &amp; the steam whistles of locomotives half a mile distant.
                Then the lights at night seen from here make a curious exhibition. At both places I
                stop, we have plenty of ripe fresh fruit and lots of flowers. Pete, I could now send
                you a bouquet every morning, far better than I used to, of much choicer flowers. </p>

            <p class="tei_p">And how are you getting along, dearest comrade? I hope you are well, &amp; that every
                thing is going on right with you. I have not heard from you for a good while, it
                    seems.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> I suppose
                you got my last letter, 14th, from N. Y. I expect to return to N. Y. about the 22d.
                Should you feel to write after receiving this, you might direct to 331 East 55th st.
                as before. I am well as usual. I am luxuriating on excellent grapes. I wish I could
                send you a basket. At both places I stop they have vineyards, &amp; the grapes are
                very good &amp; plenty this year. Last night, when I went up at 11 o'clock to my
                room, I took up three great bunches, each as big as my fist, &amp; sat down and eat
                them before I turned in. I like to eat them this way, &amp; it agrees with me. It is
                quite a change here from my associations &amp; surroundings either in Washington or
                New York. Evenings &amp; meal times I find myself thrown amidst a mild, pleasant
                society, really intellectual, composed largely of educated women, some young, some
                not so young, every thing refined &amp; polite, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span> disposed
                to small talk, conversing in earnest on profound subjects, but with a moderate
                rather slow tone, &amp; in a kind &amp; conciliatory manner—delighting in this
                sort of conversation, &amp; spending their evenings till late in it. I take a hand
                in, for a change. I find it entertaining, as I say, for novelty's sake, for a week
                or two—but I know very well that would be enough for me. It is all first-rate,
                good &amp; smart, but too constrained &amp; bookish for a free old hawk like me. I
                send you my love, dear Pete. <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">So long</span>. Will write from N. Y.
                soon as I return there.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">P.S. Just after 12 o'clock—noon—as I am just finishing, the storm
                    lightens up—I am sure I see a bit of blue sky in the clouds—yes,
                    the sun is certainly breaking out. </p>
