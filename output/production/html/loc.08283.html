                    (1845–1912), an American poet, was born in Hudson, Michigan, and attended
                    Hillsdale College. He worked for newspapers early in his writing career and went
                    on to author several books of poetry, including <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rifts in the

                    of numerous historical and travel works. He edited the work <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Old Yorkshire</span>, which spanned five volumes and included historical,
                    archeological, and descriptive notes related to Yorkshire, England. The volumes
                    were published in the early 1880s, with the fifth and final volume published in
                    1884. Smith was also the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Rambles about Morley with
                        Descriptive and Historic Sketches</span> (1866) and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A
                        Yorkshireman's trip to the United States and Canada</span> (1892). On May 9,
                    1891, approximately a month after Whitman received Carleton's letter of
                    introduction, Smith traveled to Camden to visit Whitman. Whitman's health
                    prevented him from having a long conversation with Smith, but Smith was able to
                    speak with the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke at Whitman's house.
                    Smith's account of the visit to Whitman was published in his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">A
                        Yorkshireman's trip to the United States and Canada</span>, and an <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00562.html">excerpt of the book's sixth chapter</a> includes Smith's impressions of
                    Whitman and the poet's Mickle Street home. </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
