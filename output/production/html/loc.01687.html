                <span class="tei_salute">Dear Alfred Pratt,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am still here in Washington, &amp; work in the same office—My health is good, 
                &amp; there is nothing specially new or important with me since I wrote you last. 
                I have received your letters. Dear boy, I would like to see you, that we might be together once more, 
                even if but for a little while—I have thought I would try to journey out your way, for a few days—but it dont seem practicable just at present—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope you are well—you must write me a good long letter all about your affairs &amp; yourself—all will be interesting—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I send you my love, &amp; to your parents also—Tell them I hope yet to meet them—Good bye, dear young man—I too have not forgotten those times when you lay sick in the hospital—&amp; our love for each other—such things are not easily forgotten—Some day I will try to come out there, &amp; we will see each other again.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">I send you a newspaper with a piece in about me, that may interest you. I send it same mail with this.
