        <span class="tei_salute">My dear Mr. Tenn[yson]</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Since I last wrote you, (your kind response was duly rec'd) I have been laid up here nearly all the time, &amp;
        still continue so, quite shattered, but somehow with good spirits—not well enough to
        go out in the world &amp; go to work—but not sick enough to give up either, or lose my
        interest in affairs, life, literature, &amp;c. I keep up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a
        little nearly every day. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been reading your Queen Mary, &amp; think you have
        excelled yourself in it. I did not know till I read it, how much eligibility to passion,
        character and art arousings was still left to me in my sickness &amp; old age. Though I am
        Democrat enough to realize the deep criticism of Jefferson on Walter Scott's writings, (&amp; many of the finest plays, poems &amp; romances) that
        they fail to give at all the life of the great mass of the people then &amp; there. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">But I shall print a new volume before long, &amp; will send you a copy. I send you a paper
        about same mail with this.
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Soon as convenient write me a few lines. (Put in your letter your exact p.o. address.) If you have leisure, tell me about yourself. I shall never see you &amp;
        talk to you—so I hope you will write to make it up. </p>
