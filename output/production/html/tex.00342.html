      <p class="tei_p">Since I last wrote you, (your kind response was duly rec'd)<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> I have been laid up here nearly all the time, &amp;
        still continue so, quite shattered, but somehow with good spirits—not well enough to
        go out in the world &amp; go to work—but not sick enough to give up either, or lose my
        interest in affairs, life, literature, &amp;c. I keep up &amp; dressed, &amp; go out a
        little nearly every day. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have been reading your Queen Mary,<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> &amp; think you have
        excelled yourself in it. I did not know till I read it, how much eligibility to passion,
        character and art arousings was still left to me in my sickness &amp; old age. Though I am
        Democrat enough to realize the deep criticism of Jefferson on Walter Scott's<a href="#n0546" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0546">5</a> writings, (&amp; many of the finest plays, poems &amp; romances) that
        they fail to give at all the life of the great mass of the people then &amp; there. </p>

      <p class="tei_p">But I shall print a new volume before long, &amp; will send you a copy. I send you a paper
        about same mail with this.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">6</a>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Soon as convenient write me a few lines. (Put in your letter your exact p.o. address.) If you have leisure, tell me about yourself. I shall never see you &amp;
        talk to you—so I hope you will write to make it up. </p>

                    after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
                    poetry. Whitman wrote to Tennyson in 1871 or late 1870, probably shortly after the 
                    visit of Cyril Flower in December, 1870, but the letter is not extant (see Thomas Donaldson,

                        12, 1871</a>. Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
