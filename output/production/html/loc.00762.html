               <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Jeff must have got a letter<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a> from me yesterday, containing George's last letter.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> The news of your sickness, and the strange silence of Han made me feel somewhat gloomy. I wrote to George yesterday, conveying the news—and to-day I have sent him another letter, with much more comfortable news, for I was so glad to hear from Han, (her letter, enclosed in Jeff's, received this morning) that I wrote him right away, and sent Han's letter.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I am quite in hopes George will get a furlough—may-be my expectations are unfounded, but I almost count on it.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a> I am so glad this morning to hear you are no worse, but changed for the better—and dear sister Mat too, and sissy, I am so glad to think they are recovering.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a> Jeff's enclosure of $10 through Mr. Lane,<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a> from the young engineers, for the soldiers in hospitals, the most needy cases, came safe of course—I shall acknowledge it to Mr. Lane to-morrow. Mother, I have written so much about hospitals, that I will not write any in this letter.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We have had bad weather enough here lately to most make up for the delightful weather we had for five weeks after I came from home.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother, I do hope you will be careful, and not get any relapse—and hope you will go on improving. Do you then think of getting new apartments, after the 1st of May? I suppose Jeff has settled about the lot<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a>—it seems to me first rate as an investment—the kind of house to build is quite a consideration, (if any house,) I should build <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">a regular Irish shanty</span> myself, two rooms, and an end shed—I think that's luxury enough, since I have been down in the army.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Well, mother, I believe I will not fill out the sheet this time, as I want to go down without delay to the P. O. and send George's letter, and this one.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Good bye, dear mother,</p>

                    Jeff mentioned that he had shown Whitman's "last letter" to Moses Lane, who
                    thought it "was a clincher." Probably Lane borrowed the letter in order to aid
                    his solicitation of funds for Whitman's hospital work. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00762_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00762_n2"><span>From his camp near

                    receive a furlough, he would submit his resignation, "as it is hardly a fair
                    shake for some to go home two or three times a year while others cant get away
                    at all." On <a href="duk.00337">February 6, 1863</a>, he was still
                    discouraged about the prospects for a leave. </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00762_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00762_n5"><span>On the day Whitman wrote
                    this letter, Jeff reported that the three were recovering, and that "I think

                    (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
                    to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
                    there as city engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money from his employees and
                    friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
                        <a href="loc.00883">January 26, 1863</a>, and later various sums which
                    Whitman acknowledged in letters from <a href="loc.00769">May 11, 1863</a>,
                        <a href="loc.00772">May 26, 1863</a>, and <a href="loc.00789">
                        September 9, 1863</a>. In his letter of <a href="loc.00884">May 27,
                        1863</a>, Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in
                    the Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman
                    wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of
                    money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
                    (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
                    Whitman in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from <a href="loc.00758">December 29, 1862</a>, and <a href="loc.00764">February 13, 1863</a>). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal
                    welfare that on <a href="loc.00405">April 3, 1863</a>, he sent through
                    Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit." </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">7. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00762_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00762_n7"><span>On <a href="loc.00397">February 6, 1863</a>, Jeff wrote: "I think I shall be
                    able to carry through my little 'real estate' scheme without much trouble, and I
                    think it is a good one, at least I must try, for I am 'in' and I suppose I shall
                    not be a true Whitman if I dont get disheartened, however I do not feel at all
