                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    Whitman had asked both William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make
                    an abstract in English of it (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of <a href="loc.07567">January 22, 1889</a>, and to Bucke of <a href="loc.07572">January 27, 1889</a>). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
                    an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">In Re</span>
                    (1893, pp. 159–94). Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935) was a translator
                    and poet from France, who commented positively not only on Whitman's work but
                    also on Poe's. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman:
