            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I am having another of my bad spells to-day—but it will pass over—I have had a pretty good 
                time most of the week till last night—thought I was getting decidedly better—(&amp; guess I am yet, &amp; that this will pass over.)</p>
           <p class="tei_p">Every thing goes on the same with me here. As I write this, I am sitting here alone as usual 
                in the parlor by the heater—I have just been out, but it was so chilly &amp; raw, I didn't 
                venture off the block, but came back in 5 or 6 minutes—the air feels like snow.</p>
            
            
            <p class="tei_p">The trains of the Camden &amp; Amboy are going by on the track about 50 or 60 rods from here, 
                puffing &amp; blowing—often train after train, following each other—&amp; locomotives singly, 
                whisking &amp; squealing, up the track &amp; then down again—I often sit here 
                &amp; watch them long—&amp; think of you.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I think I shall try again to get out, evening—sometimes it makes me feel better, 
                after I get out in the open air, &amp; move around a little</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01638.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01638.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01638.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">—I am writing this over in the Mercantile Library, 10th st. <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="Philadelphia​ ">Phila.</span>​ —I have felt better 
                since 4 o'clock &amp; have come out &amp; crossed the river, &amp; taken quite a ride up Market st. 
                2 miles in the Market st. cars. The cars are very nice, old style, cushioned, fare 7 cents—if you get a transfer you have to pay extra—the working hours are from 16½ to 18—they have the new alarm punch,—every fare or ticket,—rings a little bell every time you punch—I suppose you have seen it—they say it is quite a success, &amp; they are introducing them 
                in other cities—but it will get played out—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">—Pete write how you are getting along—&amp; all about the folks, every one I know—I am feeling as well as usual, as I finish this letter—Good bye for this time my loving son—</p>

                    be together, &amp; have good times just being with each other, no matter how poor
