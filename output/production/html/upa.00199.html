                <span class="tei_salute">Dear friend</span>
            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Down here for a few days I thought you would like to get
                news right from the midst of people &amp; scenes you loved so well—I came down
                yesterday amid sousing rain &amp; cloudy weather—but this forenoon it is
                sunshiny &amp; delightful—I have just returned from a two hours ramble in the
                old woods—wintry &amp; bare, &amp; yet lots of holly &amp; laurel—&amp;
                I only wish I could send you some cedary branches thick with the china-blue little
                plums, so pretty amid the green tufts—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Staffords are all well—Mrs S is much as usual, looks in good
                condition—I heard her singing this morning at her work in the kitchen before I
                was up—George has been well, &amp; is so—Ed &amp; Debby &amp; Harry
                &amp; Mont &amp; Van &amp; Ruth &amp; little George all right—Jo Browning
                ditto—Jo &amp; D had some company here to supper last evening—Harry is
                away at the RR office at Clementon (Narrow Gauge)—likes it—is home only
                at long intervals—Ed tends the store, &amp; the nag Ned looks as well as ever—it is now nearly
                12—&amp; we are going to have chicken for dinner—My morning paper has
                just come from Phila: &amp; I will knock off &amp; read it—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Dec 31—Saturday noon—Well this is the last day of the year, &amp; it has
                grown freezing cold—Mr S is out at the wood-pile chopping away—I hear
                the sound of his axe as I write—Mont went off early, he goes over to Clementon
                and works at telegraphy, learning &amp; assisting Harry—comes home quite
                late—Ed is busy with customers in the store—Ruth is in the kitchen
                making mince pies for New Year's—Mrs S is just sitting down a spell in the old
                rocking chair, reading to-day's Phila: Ledger—the acc't of the Guiteau
                    trial—(I don't know whether you read it or
                not, but of all the strange things of this strange century, I am not sure but that
                trial is the strangest)—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">We had a flurry of snow last evening, &amp; it looks wintry enough to-day, but the
                sun is out, &amp; I take my walks in the woods. Hienikin was here
                yesterday—Wesley Stafford &amp; his wife (Lizzie Hyder you know) have just
                drove up—they are very comfortable at the old place by the pond, &amp; Lizzie
                is reconciled &amp; happy—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Herb, I thought you would just like to hear all the small news &amp; gossip &amp; so
                I have written it—O how shocking I felt at the sad sad sudden death of the
                dear one—was a long time before I realized it as
                true—hope your dear mother—to whom I send best love—is beginning
                to feel something like herself again—tell her I rec'd hers of Dec 14, &amp;
                will write before long—All here speak of you with
                love, &amp; send affectionate remembrances—My best love to Giddy—</p>
