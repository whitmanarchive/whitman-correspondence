            <p class="tei_p">I have been in all day—I don't think I ever knew such long continued gales of wind—this is now the fourth or fifth day—night &amp; day—&amp; as I write it is howling 
                &amp; whirling just as bad as ever—I havn't been out any to speak of for three days—the gales are too much for me. My spell of let up &amp; feeling somewhat more comfortable continues, 
                with some interruptions—night before last, &amp; for some time yesterday I was in a bad way again—but had a good night's rest last night, &amp; am comfortable to-day—I think I am decidedly more improving, than going behindhand—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I have thought frequently of Parker Milburn—all his ways, &amp; his good points, come up in my mind—&amp; now the news comes of the sudden death of Mr. Sumner—Your letter came Monday, &amp; the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Herald</span>—</p><span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01644.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01644.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01644.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">Not very well to-day—To add to my troubles, a very bad cold in the head &amp; all over me, 
                again—this is the third attack this winter—but enough of grunting—The papers are filled with Sumner's death, funeral, life, &amp;c. The cold, dry gale continues here. 
                I get letters from Mrs O'Connor. Don't fail to go up &amp; make her a call, when convenient.
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">You remember Arnold Johnson that used to live over on the hill by the Insane Asylum—well he has come back to Washington, &amp; is Chief Clerk again Light House Board, 
                &amp; Wm O'Connor has changed to a clerkship in the Library, Treasury. I am sitting here alone in the same old seat in the parlor writing.
