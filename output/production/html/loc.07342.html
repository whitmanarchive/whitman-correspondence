                of 27 Feb.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a> and the funny little wood cut. So you have

                come to something if you stuck to your business long enough! Burroughs' letter is
                deeply interesting—but what ails the fellow that he is so damned pathetic? He
                is (I judge) fairly well fixed (as things go)—good reputation, lovely home,
                enough to eat &amp;c. &amp;c. then why is he so infernally down in the mouth all the
                time? I don't see anything to whine about in getting old—think (on the whole)
                it is rather a good joke—my strongest feeling

            about it is: what is to come next? That we are going to (or towards) the bad all the
                time does not occur to me as likely at all and if not what is there to be blue
                about? I have just received and answered the enclosed long letter from Mrs O'Connor<a href="#n4137" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4137">4</a>
                which I am sure you would like to read—you need not return it. I have some
                notion that I may take a week's run about middle of April to Philadelphia, Baltimore
                and Washington. I shall look out for the May Century with considerable interest.<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">5</a> We

                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
                    of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
                    Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An

                    (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After
                    returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a decades-long
                    correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman.
                    However, the correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged,
                    curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or
                    devoted to Whitman's work: <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and
                        Person</span> (1867), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Birds and Poets</span> (1877), <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Whitman, A Study</span> (1896), and <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Accepting
                        the Universe</span> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs,
                    see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</span>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

                    wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
                    defenders. Before marrying William, Ellen Tarr was active in the antislavery and
                    women's rights movements as a contributor to the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Liberator</span> and to a women's rights newspaper <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Una</span>. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
                    years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
                    friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
                    African Americans, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
                    between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
                    with William. Three years after William O'Connor's death, Ellen married the 
                    Providence businessman Albert Calder. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
