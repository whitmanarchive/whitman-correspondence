            <p class="tei_p">I have just rec'd your letter—I thought of you during that storm—it was very severe here too, 
                &amp; awful gales of wind one or two nights—The dinner in the Hospital<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>
                was a complete success—there was plenty, &amp; good too—turkey &amp; four or five kinds of vegetables, &amp; mince pie, &amp;c—then I purchased a large quantity of navy plug, &amp; smoking tobacco, &amp; pipes, &amp;c. and after dinner
                every body that wanted to, had a good smoke—&amp; I had a lot of oranges, apples, &amp;c. &amp; a large sugar cake for supper—then I read some amusing pieces to them for three quarters of an hour, for a change—&amp; sat down by those who were worst off—&amp;c. &amp;c. Nobody else came in that day. 
                They have a Chaplain, but he is miserable coot, like the rest of his tribe.

            <p class="tei_p">I have written again to Han—
                I am writing this in the office, all alone—I am going down to the Hospital for a little while, &amp; to carry some tobacco—&amp; then I am invited to O'Connor's to dinner at 4 o'clock—we are to have cold turkey, hot vegetables, &amp;c—They are going to stay where they are till next March. 
                We have had quite a snow storm here—it is snowing moderately now. 
                Some are out with their sleighs. I am glad to hear such a good account of Eddy.
                It makes me feel quite satisfied.

                    (1825–1878), translator of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Faust</span>, journalist, and
                    traveler, had sent a copy of his poem "The Picture of St. John" to Walt Whitman
                    in a <a href="loc.00871">November 12, 1866</a> letter, to which Whitman
                    responded in a <a href="uva.00348">November 18, 1866</a> letter to Taylor.
                    In the November 12 letter, Taylor commended Whitman's "remarkable powers of
                    expression" and "deep and tender reverence for Man." His letter <a href="loc.00872">of December 2, 1866</a> was even more unreserved in its
                    praise of Whitman. Later Taylor's enthusiasm for Whitman was to change
                    dramatically. In <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Echo Club</span> (2d ed., 1876),
                    154–158, 168–169, Taylor burlesqued Whitman's poetry. In his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</span> (1896), William Sloane
                    Kennedy lists Taylor among Whitman's "Bitter and Relentless Foes and Cillifiers." </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
