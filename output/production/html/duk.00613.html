                    (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
                    children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
                    and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son

                    "had a slight stroke of paralysis" and was "not able to get up," but he added
                    that he had "some very attentive friends" (see his <a href="yal.00402">January 26, 1873</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n1">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00613_n1 note" id="duk.00613_n1"><span>Walt befriended Peter Doyle
                    (1843–1907), a horsecar conductor in Washington, around 1865. Though
                    Whitman informed Doyle of his flirtations with women in their correspondence,
                    Martin G. Murray affirms that "Whitman and Doyle were 'lovers' in the
                    contemporary sense of the word." Doyle assisted in caring for Whitman after his
                    stroke in January 1873.

                    New Jersey, from January 7–10, 1873 (see Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
                    University Press, 1961–77], 2:191, n. 2). </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00613_n5 note" id="duk.00613_n5"><span>Walt Whitman assured his
                    mother that he would convey "the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">exact truth—neither
                        better nor worse</span>" (see his <a href="yal.00402">January 26,
                        1873</a> letter). A week later he wrote that despite the doctor's
                    assurance and his own confidence that he was improving he had to remain in bed
                    because he could "not move yet without great difficulty" (see his <a href="yal.00404">January 29, 1873</a> letter to Louisa Van Velsor
                    Whitman). </span></span> [<a href="#r5">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">6. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00613_n3 note" id="duk.00613_n3"><span>This letter dates to January
                    30, 1873, which is consistent with the day of week, Thursday, and day of month,
                    30, in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand at the end of the letter. Richard
                    Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1873, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
                    Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York:
                    New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:370). Louisa's letter acknowledges
                    one from Walt Whitman, in which he wrote that he was confined to his room,
                    unable to walk, and had "attentive friends" (see Walt's <a href="yal.00402">January 26, 1873</a> letter to Louisa). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
