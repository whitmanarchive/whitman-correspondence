                <span class="tei_salute">Dear boy Pete,</span>
            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">There is great excitement here over the returns of yesterdays elections, 
                as I suppose there is the same in Washington also—the Democrats look blue enough, 
                &amp; the Republicans are on their high horses.<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">1</a> I suppose Grants' success is now certain. 
                As I write, the bands are out here, parading the streets, &amp; the drums beating. 
                It is now forenoon. To-night we will hear the big guns, &amp; see the blazing bonfires. 
                It is dark &amp; cloudy weather here to-day. I was glad to get your letter of Friday, 
                9th which is the last<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">2</a>—also a Star at same time. Also this morning, Star an Express 
                of 12th. I suppose you rec'd mine of the 9th &amp; the papers. I am about as well as usual. 
                Mother is well, &amp; my brothers the same. I am going to-morrow to Providence, R. I. 
                to spend a few days. Should you write any time within four or five days after receiving this, 
                direct to me, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">care of Hon. Thomas Davis, Providence, R. I.</span><a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a>
            </p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">My friend O'Connor is quite unwell, and is absent from Washington away down 
                on the New England coast.<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">4</a> I received a letter from him yesterday. 
                I believe I told you I was finishing up about 230 copies of my book, 
                expecting to sell them. I have had them finished up &amp; bound &amp;c. but there 
                is a hitch about the sale, &amp; I shall not be able to sell them at present. 
                There is a pretty strong enmity here toward me, &amp; L. of G., among certain classes—not only that it is a great mess of crazy talk &amp; hard words, all tangled up, 
                without sense or meaning, (which by the by is, I believe, your judgment about it)—but others sincerely think that it is a bad book, improper, &amp; ought to be denounced 
                &amp; put down, &amp; its author along with it. There are some venemous but laughable 
                squibs occasionally in the papers. One said I had received 25 guineas for a piece 
                in an English magazine, but that it was worth all that for any one to read it.

                When they get off a good squib, however, I laugh at it, just as much as any one.

                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
