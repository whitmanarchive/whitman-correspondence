            <p class="tei_p">Drizzle, darkness and a warm humidity form the
                character of the weather here to-day; yesterday ditto. A gummy dampness penetrates
                everywhere; and meat and vegetables "spoil" with wondrous quickness. The trees on
                the Battery and in the Park have cast a good share of their leaves, and the rest
                begin to turn yellow. In the streets mud and hogs reign triumphant—their
                domain only disputed, here and there, by the little crossing sweepers, with their
                petticoats draggled in front and tucked up behind. A bad day for walking, shopping,
                or going out of doors any way!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Leonard, the seaman wounded by the Captain on board
                the ship Thomas H. Perkins, proves not to be dangerously hurt; on the contrary, he
                is recovering.</p>  
            <p class="tei_p">The Coroner's jury in the case of Austin, Captain of the Empire Club,
                charged with the murder of Shea, in Leonard street, found a verdict on Saturday that
                Shea was shot by the said Austin. Notwithstanding this, the latter was admitted to
                bail—Elijah Purdy, Daniel Sweeney and Alderman Foote becoming sureties.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Cornelius S. Bogardus has been appointed by the President Naval Officer for the port
                of New York, in the place of the late Mr. Hoffman. Orders were received last week in
                the Customhouse here, from Washington, for turning out the barnburners who hold
                clerkships, inspectorships, and so forth. Mr. Lawrence returned, for answer, that he
                was responsible himself for the performance of his duties—wherefor he had
                given heavy security; that the officials sought to be expunged were men that he had
                tried—many of them old officers—and found to be competent and
                trustworthy; and that, if that Government was not satisfied with his conduct, and
                the discharge of his duties, it was at liberty to appoint another Collector in his
                place. Thus the matter stands at present.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The VanBurenites hold a mass meeting in
                the Park on Wednesday evening next, 4th inst. John Van Buren and Mr. Wilmot, of
                "Proviso" fame, are to speak. I shall endeavor to be there, and render you an
                account of the personal appearance and manners of these gents.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The Tribune of this
                morning calls upon the members of the old "liberty party," or abolitionists proper,
                to vote for General Taylor—What are you laughing at?</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The sum of $11,000, which
                sailed away from Rotterdam in the packet, accompanied by a Mr. F. H. Gernus, who
                "defalcated" it—and the sum of $2000, in the same way from Bremen by Mr.
                Martin Valerius—were nabbed by the police officers here on Saturday
                last.—What with magnetic telegraph and steam communication, it is hard for
                rogues to escape. If they flee to the uttermost parts of the earth, their character
                is apt to be there before them—and a police officer besides.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">Macready appears
                at the Astor Place Theatre on Wednesday night. Many will no doubt go to see this old
                man, whose remains of genius even are no doubt respectable; but it is idle to claim
                for him, in his decay, the name of a great actor. Collins continues at the Broadway;
                Esmeralda at the Park; Hamblin is playing a round of tragedy characters at the
                Bowery; Chanfrau and Esmeralda at the National; light comic and musical pieces at
                the Olympic; ditto at the Chambers street....The grandest concert ever given in this
                city comes off at the Tabernacle to-night.....The Crescent City is to start at 4
                o'clock this afternoon.</p>
