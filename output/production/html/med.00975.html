            <p class="tei_p">Drizzle, darkness and a warm humidity form the
                character of the weather here to-day; yesterday ditto. A gummy dampness penetrates
                everywhere; and meat and vegetables "spoil" with wondrous quickness. The trees on
                the Battery and in the Park have cast a good share of their leaves, and the rest
                begin to turn yellow. In the streets mud and hogs reign triumphant—their
                domain only disputed, here and there, by the little crossing sweepers, with their
                petticoats draggled in front and tucked up behind. A bad day for walking, shopping,
                or going out of doors any way!</p>

                was responsible himself for the performance of his duties—wherefor he had
                given heavy security; that the officials sought to be expunged were men that he had

                trustworthy; and that, if that Government was not satisfied with his conduct, and
