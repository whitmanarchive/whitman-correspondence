            <p class="tei_p">I this day saw in the paper "Hearth and Home" of New York a short editorial stating that Congress had caused the discharge from public service of many persons who were brought into distress thereby, and your name was mentioned as one of the number. This last concerns me seriously and causes me to <span class="unclear deletion tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_deletion tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">write</span> to a complete stranger.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I wish first to amuse you a little, then to acquaint myself with your real situation, and lastly to see if I can be of service to you if you are really in distress.</p>
             
            <p class="tei_p">A Narrative—About five years ago I read in the Louisville (K.Y.) Courier-Journal a notice of the death of Walt Whitman a Poet. Of that notice I remembered only a few words. Afterwards occasionally saw humorous poems or would-be poems about current events "in the style of Walt Whitman". About that time I also, obeying an "impulse" or "law of my being" which was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">effectual</span> if not "irresistible" <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">went for a Poet</span> for my county. Yes, Bret Harte, Joaquin Miller, and myself blazed forth on a world <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">for</span> a county in the same otherwise eventful year 1870. Last winter I <span class="unclear deletion tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_deletion tei_unclear_cert_medium tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">saw</span> a short item in a paper making me suspect that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Walt</span> might still be in "a state of probation". Again this summer learned in my backwoods hermit home that Walt's Poems were in books, and that "English critics consider him the greatest Poet of America." Accordingly I sent some money to a New York Bookseller and got "Leaves of Grass" and

I had expected something strange, but the work was so very different from anything else I had met with it was for a short hour or so utterly incomprehensible. In my disappointment and vexation I then said to my family "the Publisher who <span class="unclear deletion tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_deletion tei_unclear_cert_high tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">would</span> publish and the Bookseller who <span class="unclear deletion tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_deletion tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_al">sells</span> such a book ought to be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>.  In a little time with the help of the Preface in the small volume and the Publishers notes at the end of the same I got a hint or clue to the understanding of your work. I think myself exceedingly good tho' at solving literary puzzles and would probably have soon divined the mystery from the work alone. I assure you I was soon "cavorting" round and asserting that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now Laugh)</p>

                    (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
                    rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
                    although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
                    When Johnson wrote for the first time on <a href="loc.01837">August 13,
                        1874</a>, he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
                    letter from <a href="loc.01838">September 13, 1874</a>: a former Rebel
                    soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
                    war he had been "a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">slaveholding</span> youthful 'patriarch.'"
                    He informed Whitman in the <a href="loc.01837">August 13, 1874</a>, letter
                    that during the past summer he had bought <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>
                    and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">hung for swindling</span>," he discovered the mystery of
                    Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
                    that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
                    Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
                    profits or to lend him money. On <a href="loc.01840">October 7, 1874</a>,
                    after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
                    mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Orthodoxy</span> flourishes with the usual <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">lack</span> of
                        <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">flowers</span> or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">fruit</span>." See
                    also Charles N. Elliot, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
                        Friend</span> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130. </span></span></p></div>
