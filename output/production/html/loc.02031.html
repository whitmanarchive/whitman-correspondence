            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">yr's rec'd &amp; welcomed, as always—So you have
                flitted north on the Pacific Coast &amp; settled in San Francisco. Good—no
                doubt—To use the NY slang of low life I send you "good roots" for your new
                &amp; future habitat—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">—I am still holding out here—probably better than you might
                suppose—but bad enough—physically almost completely disabled—brain
                physique, locomotion, bladder business, digestion, &amp;c: &amp;c: all in pretty bad
                way—yet I sit up, read and write (moderately) &amp; get out doors in a propell'd
                chair &amp; keep good spirits—Nothing very significant in my literary
                affairs—hardly any sales—poor dear W O'C he has left by his death a great blank to
                me too—I just mail'd his little last book "Donnelly's Reviewers" to John Burroughs, who is
                temporarily at Hobart N Y &amp; is well as usual—Hot Spell here—three weeks—to day bad.—I hear fm Dr Bucke 
                often—Mrs. O'C (I fear by accounts) is left with very
                little financially—spent an hour down by the Delaware river side in my wheel
                chair</p>
