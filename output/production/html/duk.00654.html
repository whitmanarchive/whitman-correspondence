            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been thinking about you this morning, and will write a few lines, 
                though without any thing special to communicate. My vacation is nearly done, 
                &amp; in four or five days more I shall be back in Washington. I have been here in 
                Providence the past week, as guest of Thomas Davis, a manufacturer here, 
                &amp; formerly M. C.—have had a good time generally, in a quiet way—am going on to New York this afternoon, &amp; shall be back in Washington on the 27th—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">William O'Connor is here in Providence—I have been with him a good deal—he is not very well, but goes around—Will finish my letter in New York, 
                &amp; mail it thence to-morrow.
            </p>
