            <p class="tei_p">I have been thinking about you this morning, and will write a few lines,

                Providence the past week, as guest of Thomas Davis, a manufacturer here, 
                &amp; formerly M. C.—have had a good time generally, in a quiet way—am going on to New York this afternoon, &amp; shall be back in Washington on the 27th—</p>
