            <p class="tei_p">Before the old year is closing I will send you a few lines only to express the hope, that you may 
                enter into the new year in an ameliorated state of health mind and body! Your answer to my letter 
                from Garsdal I <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">duely​ </span><span class="tei_corr">duly​

      </span></span> after the receipt of it I sent you a 
                number of "Danish Folkets Avis" 
                (Danish people's paper) with a criticism of your book by Mr Termansen—a 
                very bad one. 
                <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01913.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.01913.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.01913.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>
                The author is a peasant, member of our Danish house of the Commons, originally a gifted man, but 
                at present one of the spoiled darlings of the haut ton Copenhagen society. Even into the greatest 
                assemblies he appears in the coarse stuffs of the Danish peasants' home dress;—vanity! He is 
                one of what Björnson with a very happy expression calls the 
                "pale-born peasants."</p>

            <p class="tei_p">If you have had the criticisms especially Elster's, completely translated to 
                you I should like to know what impression all these foreign judgments may have made

                on you. The least benevolent of them are, you will allow, far more benevolent than your homely 
                American criticisms. But you have many friends, male and female, here, who don't write criticisms.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">accostumed​ </span><span class="tei_corr">accustomed​
        
      </span></span> to receive papers and 
                small parcels from you and have always been glad for it, even when I forgot to thank you. In the 
                last five months I have received nothing. Earnestly hoping that the reason may not be, that your 
                illness has increased</p>
