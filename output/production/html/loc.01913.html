                The author is a peasant, member of our Danish house of the Commons, originally a gifted man, but 
                at present one of the spoiled darlings of the haut ton Copenhagen society. Even into the greatest 
                assemblies he appears in the coarse stuffs of the Danish peasants' home dress;—vanity! He is 
                one of what Björnson<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">3</a> with a very happy expression calls the 
                "pale-born peasants."</p>

                on you. The least benevolent of them are, you will allow, far more benevolent than your homely 
                American criticisms. But you have many friends, male and female, here, who don't write criticisms.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">I have been <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">accostumed​ </span></span> to receive papers and 
                small parcels from you and have always been glad for it, even when I forgot to thank you. In the 
                last five months I have received nothing. Earnestly hoping that the reason may not be, that your 
                illness has increased</p>
