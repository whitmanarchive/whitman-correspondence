            <p class="tei_p"> What revelations of the last 18 months! </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> How soul-sickening! </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> What "joy of suffering" there from! In the summer of '80, my oldest son (of this, my
                second wife,) being then a well-grown, strong, and healthy boy of 17 years 4 months,
                took a notion he must go to Texas. He did tolerably well then for two years. He
                become large sized and extra strong.....A woman 2 years his senior, a sort of
                "heiress" (in a small way,) began to think she must have a husband; and after a
                failure to get another young fellow (a kinsman of ours) to come from there,) opened up a correspondence with our
                boy. At the same time she coquetted with another young man nearer home. Our boy came
                home, and seemed to become crazed for <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02407.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02407.002_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02407.002_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> a person of no accomplishments or
                charms (whatever) unless a seductive pretence or fancy of attachment—while the
                very climax of indecision and inconstancy. In spite of all I could say—in
                spite of the "Body Electric" with its grand "old man, a common farmer"—in
                spite of all a "philosopher" could say or plead (from stores of reading &amp;
                reflection) they married—or rather consorted. Straightway he went to hardest
                work like the wildest fanatic. Building, building, &amp;c—not too much tho'
                except that his foundation was—SAND! 20 months hardest work (and
                wretchedness.) 20 months supreme idling, "gadding", tales to "Ma!" To
                others—"he would be good to me if I would let him." <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02407.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02407.003_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02407.003_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> Result—a deliberate,
                soldier-like suicide! He kept his troubles almost entirely concealed from his
                parents—we thoughts things were going just a little bad. The woman's people
                knew much more. Her four brothers of whom two were larger men, one as large, and
                one smaller, were a lot of jealous, stingy, envious fellows, who concealed their
                ill-will. (They had before maltreated a brother-in-law and a stepfather, and it
                doubtless mortified them for people to know they could'n't do the muscular and
                giant-willed young lion in the same way.) He was kind to them as if they were
                babies! They had to have their revenge (after his death) on <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">his
                    creditors</span> and his innocent father. <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02407.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02407.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02407.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>  They made the widow repudiate all
                of his debts—tho' universally known that his improvements on her land were
                worth as much as the debts, and there was much added to her personal effects. </p>
            <p class="tei_p">
                
                After long and patient reasoning the "old man" defied one of them to combat (with
                nature's weapon's)—he accepted—then weakened, "wilted", then took up a
                fence rail (having once killed a man with one at a single blow,) and made a most
                deliberate, long-continued attempt to kill. Well! he didn't kill, frighten or
                drive—and in all ways exhausted himself. Never was a sublimer scene. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Yet the most manifest, unblushing corruption (official and semi-official) and a
                total lack of manliness all around us seems about to excuse the offender </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> I am at our Circuit Court—been here some days. Since that young man was taking
                a <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">law</span> advantage of myself and other creditors of my dead
                son, after he went back on his agreement for a pugilistic encounter, I determined to
                only parry his many blows with steadfast demeanor 'till reflection <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_kb tei_unclear_cert_low">could</span> stop him;
                but he stopped only from exhaustion, (as proven by his retreat within a gate in
                search of more effective weapons—and finding nothing but one something to
                throw at me, he left off, the picture of a miserable despair.) Yet with all his and
                his folks' subsequent wretchedness, they could not master their niggardliness to do
                anything for anybody except a few least needy creditors. These last got vague and
                indirect promises—doubtless to prevent or secure <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">inffuence​ </span><span class="tei_corr">influence​
        
      </span></span>. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> What a miracle or strange happening—that <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">he</span> should be <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">drawn</span> and <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">passed</span> as a grand juror at the court
                succeeding! Some other suggestive and ugly facts. </p>

            <p class="tei_p"> The cold-hearted young widow who had witnessed and consented to her handsome (and
                for her, every way noble) husband boring a hole through his own broad and generous
                breast with a double load of buckshot, also witnessed without any remonstrance the
                attempt to demolish the gray-haired father-in-law. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> After brutal insults put on me in his brother's house, and in presence of two of his
                big and silent brothers (when I was still reasoning the matter,) and some months
                more of waiting, I went to his (bachelor) home, to challenge him. The corrupt and
                the unmanly make this their excuse, and say a petit jury would (as they fear) fail or refuse to execute the plain letter and
                spirit of the law. </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> My kin, always recognized as of superior honesty, have shown themselves in all this
                matter immeasurably sluggish and spiritless (as I wrote you some years ago that they
                were.) </p>
            <p class="tei_p"> Dear Walt, write to me at "Mid." </p>
            
                <p class="tei_p">My kin are much allied with those bad people by marriages. Our broad estates are all
                    adjoining.</p>
