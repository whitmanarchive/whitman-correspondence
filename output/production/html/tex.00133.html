            <p class="tei_p">Not knowing what they were agoing to do with me until thursday last is my excuse for not writing sooner. Thursday I expected my dischar[g]e so that I could start Friday but on going to the office I found that they had not yet been signed by Bliss you recollect that Stearns told me he knew that they had gone up and when the truth was known he knew nothing about it thursday afternoon my papers wer sent in to the ward for me to go before Bliss he examined me and told me I could have my papers in three days think I can start tuesday for home    I have got so that I am able to walk to the Sutler's and back</p>
            <p class="tei_p">(Walt it is useless for me to try to tell you how much i have missed you at night when my supper was brought in there was still something wanting that that was your cheerful smiling face! and then too I missed your kiss of friendship and love as also your kind "good night" or "So long")</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I should like much to have seen you again before I went home. I have some thoughts of going up to Annapolis before I start north but have not yet decided. please write as soon as you get this and direct to Portage Kalamazoo, Co. Michigan good by dear friend</p>
