                    (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
                    in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
                        1880</span> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
                    Washington after the war; see "Letter from Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30,
                    1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>
                    [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 1:331–332). When a pension
                    for Whitman was proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was
                    quoted: "I am of opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during
                    the war accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr.
                    Whitman" (Thomas Donaldson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> [New
                    York: F. P. Harper, 1896], 169). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
