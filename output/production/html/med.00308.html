                        to Walt Whitman on <a href="nyp.00231">January 4, 1865</a>, relating
                        his attempts to arrange for the exchange of George, who was in a Confederate
                        prison at that time; see Whitman's letter to William D. O'Connor of <a href="nyp.00196">January 6, 1865</a>.</p>
                    <p class="tei_p">In Whitman scholarship, this letter traditionally has been identified as "to
                        Dana F. Wright," based on Wright's signature at the end of his <a href="nyp.00231">January 4, 1865</a> letter to Whitman. Descendants
                        of Wright as well as military roster and census data confirm Wright's first
