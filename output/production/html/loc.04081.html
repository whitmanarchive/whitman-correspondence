            <p class="tei_p">I send you by this mail a copy of one essay of mine which is just published—I do not know whether it will be of any interest to you—it ought to be for it was inspired directly by yourself—it is part of a book which I have been engaged upon for about six years—the book is on "Man's Moral Nature." this book as I say was inspired by yourself about six years ago in the city of London England.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">This is a payment of that truth which is said to be stranger than fiction.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope to publish the book in a year or at most two from this time and I intend if you do not object to dedicate it to you. This letter has rather a mysterious air about it especially as being written by a "materialist" to a "materialist" Some day if ever we meet again as I trust we shall I will explain it.</p>
