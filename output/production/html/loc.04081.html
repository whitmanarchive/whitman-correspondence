            <p class="tei_p">I send you by this mail a copy of one essay of mine which is just published<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">2</a>—I do not know whether it will be of any interest to you—it ought to be for it was inspired directly by yourself—it is part of a book which I have been engaged upon for about six years—the book is on "Man's Moral Nature." this book as I say was inspired by yourself about six years ago in the city of London England.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">This is a payment of that truth which is said to be stranger than fiction.</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">I hope to publish the book in a year or at most two from this time and I intend if you do not object to dedicate it to you.<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">3</a> This letter has rather a mysterious air about it especially as being written by a "materialist" to a "materialist"<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">4</a> Some day if ever we meet again as I trust we shall I will explain it.</p>

                    but was still apparently using left-over stationery. The letter is endorsed, in

                    materialism is clearly expressed in his epigraph from Comte: "Les régions
                    speculative et active du cerveau n'ont de communcations nerveuses qu'avec les
                    sens et les muscles pour aperçevoir et modifier le monde exterieur" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Man's Moral Nature</span> [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1879],
                    2). Translation: "The speculative and active regions of the brain have neural
                    communications only with the senses and the muscles to perceive and modify the
                    external world." The application of the term to Whitman is less clear. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li></ul>
