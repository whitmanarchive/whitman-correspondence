                    correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
                    after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
                    Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
                    friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their

                    (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
                    attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a

                    brother of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a
                    champion of Walt Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Poems</span>, selected from the 1867 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span>. Rossetti would remain one of Whitman's staunchest supporters for
                    the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in major subscribers to the 1876 Centennial
                    edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> and fundraising for Whitman in
