            <p class="tei_p">We duly received your letter<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">1</a>—We of course all felt very indignant at the way you had been treated—but<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> when I came to the statement that Harlan was a parson<a href="#n3" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r3">3</a> of course his conduct was to be expected  From that class you can never get anything but lying and meanness—I hope you do not allow it to have any effect on you  you must not—The poor mean-minded man—If Christ came to earth again and did'nt behave different from what he did when he was here he would have a mighty poor show with Harlan would'nt he—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The most outrageous thing was published in the Eagle<a href="#n4" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4">4</a>  If you have any curiosity abt it I will send it to you  It was perfectly in keeping with the paper and I'v no doubt was considered a very good thing by little Van<a href="#n5" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r5">5</a>—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I see by the papers that the 51st will probably be mustered out in a few days<a href="#n6" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r6">6</a>  How does George feel about it<a href="#n7" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r7">7</a> I wonder—I still think if he wishes he could get in the regular army—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Mother had yesterday a letter from Heyde—10 pages—of the most disgusting trash<a href="#n8" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r8">8</a>—the vilest and meanest things that he could get together  He says he shall leave Han, and go out west<a href="#n9" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r9">9</a>—I wish he was in Hell—Mother of course is considerably exercised about it—and thinks she will go on there and bring Han home—thinks she will go next week  Of course it is foolish for Mother to attempt any thing of the kind and I dont mean to let her go—I am in hopes that George will get home next week and then he could go—I am sure that Mother would never live to get there and back let alone bringing Han—I read Heyds letter through and it is plain to me that they have had a quarrel abt some women that Heyde had in his room—they had a big row and Heyde has written to mother while the thing was fresh in his cussed head<a href="#n10" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r10">10</a>—I suppose mother will get another letter soon rather taking the edge of[f] of this one—I've no doubt that Han has a most outrageous existance—and that she had better leave Heyde but I certainly dont think that Mother—old as she is can think of going there—she can hardly move in the morning till she gets some coffee with Mat—You must write her that she had better not go till George comes home and he can go with her—or something of that kind—dont fail to write mother—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Everything is going as usual with me—all keep about the same  Mattie and the children are well  the baby is a little down just now—but I guess she will be all right again in a few days—My friend Davis<a href="#n11" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r11">11</a> has got back from Peru—he spent 3 or 4 days with me last week—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Write to me</p>

                    (1820–1899), secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed
                    Whitman from his second-class clerkship on <a href="nyp.00222">June 30,
                        1865</a>. Harlan apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> which Whitman was revising and which he
                    kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant
                    Attorney General J. Hubley Aston, Whitman secured a position in the attorney
                    general's office. The Harlan episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The
                    Good Gray Poet." Although Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman
                    may have sarcastically applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865,
                    Harlan had issued an official directive asking for the names of employees who
                    disregarded "in their conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum
                    &amp; propriety prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman's Champion</span> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
                    University Press, 1978], 57). </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n4">4. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00440_n4 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00440_n4"><span>On July 12, 1865, the
                        <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Brooklyn Daily Eagle</span> published "Morality in
                    Washington," which noted that "Walt Whitman has lost his position in the
                    Interior Department at Washington under the general order discharging immoral
                    persons, his 'Leaves of Grass' being produced as evidence of his immorality....
                    Walt is personally a good-hearted fellow, with some ability, but he was bitten
                    with the mania of transcendentalism, which broke out in New England some years
                    ago." Perhaps Jeff's outrage resulted from the charge that Whitman "wrote of
                    things no right minded person is supposed ever to think of, and used language
                    shocking to ears polite....He now occupies a desk in the Attorney General's
                    office, where we suppose they are not so particular about morals." </span></span> [<a href="#r4">back</a>]</li><li id="n5">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.00440_n5 tei_hand tei_note_resp_Berthold tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.00440_n5"><span>Isaac Van Anden.

                    quarrell me out of it—so that I leave it half eaten—she begins by
                    questioning me about my women [Heyde's art students],...and goes so far as to

                    here. Heyde's letter is clearly dated "June 1865," and while he may have written
                    in a fit of passion he had restraint enough not to send the letter immediately.
                    As Heyde himself explained: "This letter has been written for a long time. I
                    have concluded to send it to you. Realy my experience robs my heart of all
                    charity—Han has a plausible superficiality, but under that she is she
