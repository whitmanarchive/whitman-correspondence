                    Commonplace Book this letter to Rand &amp; Avery, the firm which had printed the
                    1860 and Osgood editions (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
                    Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On June 8
                    Whitman sent "corrections" to the firm and "ordered 1000 copies printed," but
                    the order was later "countermanded" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). Evidently Rand
                    &amp; Avery refused to run off the edition because of fears of legal action. On
                    July 24 Whitman paid Rand &amp; Avery $13.75, presumably for the corrections
                    (Whitman's Commonplace Book). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_wau.00002_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="wau.00002_n2"><span>Ticknor, for Osgood &amp;
                    Co., on May 19 instructed Rand &amp; Avery to hold the plates for Whitman
