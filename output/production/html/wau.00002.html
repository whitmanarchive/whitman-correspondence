            <p class="tei_p">I suppose Benj: Ticknor has informed you that the Osgood &amp; Co: plates of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> now in your charge have been transferred to
                me, &amp; are henceforth subject to my order.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Will you please prepare for me for casting a new title page, the copy for which is
                herewith enclosed—As it is a small job, could you make up (I should say in the
                same long primer as book, but I leave it to Mr Clark's
                taste), &amp; send the proof of it to me by next Monday night's mail—as I am
                waiting for new titles for 225 copies I have in sheets, &amp; have an order for—Will return proof immediately with word how many I
                want printed.</p>
