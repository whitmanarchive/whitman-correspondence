            </span>
         <p class="tei_p">I once more take my pen in hand to write a few lines to you And if I dont get an answer to this I shall never write again. I have never recd a line from you since I left Washington  I am at present attending the Commercial College here in Detroit. It is a good institution if I can judge by the Book Keepers here in the City that have been through the course  I have been here about five weeks now and think it will take about four or five weeks longer. I think I can keep Books in any business that may be brought on the carpet  Now Mr Whitman if you could get me a situation as Book Keeper or Clerk in the Paymaster department or some other good place if you will I will pay you any price your a mind to ask. Detroit is a very pleaseant City  They have two or three Theaters going now  I was to one of them last evening they Played The Country Cousin  Miss Laura Keenns Company from N.Y. City have been here for the last week last night was the last night I persume you have seen her lots of times  No more until I receive a letter from you. Yours Truly</p>
