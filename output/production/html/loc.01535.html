                    one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
                    nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
                    a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
                    passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
                    uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
                    1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
                    could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
                    moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
                    death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
                    sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.

                    Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
                    the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
                    to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For

                    (1837–1873), a former New York conductor, accosted a woman and her
                    daughter in a street car, and was rebuked by their companion, Avery D. Putnam.
                    When Putnam got off, Foster, who was drunk, killed him with a carhook. The
                    murder was reported in the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Times</span> on April
                    28, 1871. Pete Calhoun, one of Whitman's friends, was the driver of the car. Because
                    of appeals for commutation, including one from Putnam's widow, Foster was not
                    hanged until March 21, 1873. On March 21 and 22 the New York <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Daily Graphic</span> devoted pages to pictures and stories of Foster's last
