            <p class="tei_p">I was very glad to hear from this morning and hope to be able to write you soon <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in extenso</span>. I have been very sick and feeble for a month
                past, but am a little better. My eye got open at last, but is still bleary and bad.
                My present woe is a festered pen finger, sore as death, and preventing me writing.
                Altogether, I am pretty used up. Tell Traubel.<a href="#n4267" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4267">2</a>—I feel dejected at your
                illness, but am comforted to know you are better. The bladder trouble is worst to
                think of. It is one of <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">my</span> afflictions, though without
                pain.—I will try to write soon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I deeply enjoyed your reminiscence of the elder Booth<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">3</a> in <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">November

Traubel (1858–1919)
                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    (1821–1858), known simply as "Mademoiselle Rachel," was a French actor who
                    joined the famous Comédie-Française theater in Paris when she was
                    seventeen years old and quickly became celebrated, as much for her scandalous
                    love life as for her brilliant acting. She has been called the first
                    international theater star. O'Connor may have seen her on her tour of the United
                    States in 1855. She was known for her remarkable ability to inhabit classical
                    roles (in plays by Voltaire, Corneille, and Racine) as fully living women,
                    conveying their passions with great conviction. For further information, see
