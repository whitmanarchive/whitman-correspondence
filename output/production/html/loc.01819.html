                    William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later John
                    Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington years.
                    William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Harrington</span>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in
                    1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Saturday Evening
                        Post</span> before he went to Washington. O'Connor often complained about the
                    various governmental clerical posts he was to hold until his death. However, his
                    government work was relieved by the presence of Whitman, whom he was to love and
                    venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
                    vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
                    pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
                    important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
                    those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
                    O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
                    sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
                    first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Complete Prose Works</span> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910], 513). For more on

                    of Jenny Bullard" in a notebook entry alongside a warning to himself to
                    "Remember Fred Vaughn." Meditating on his relationship with Peter Doyle, Whitman
                    laments "this diseased, feverish disproportionate adhesiveness" (Edward F.

                    letter, Whitman's notebook entry is the only other reference to Bullard in the
                    poet's papers. Bullard's full name was Sarah Jane Wollstonecraft Bullard. She
                    was born in Boston September 11, 1828 and died in New Ipwich October 13, 1904.
                    Bullard never married and is said to have lived with two women. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n7">5. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_loc.01819_n7 tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_type_editorial note" id="loc.01819_n7"><span>Curtis refers to New York
