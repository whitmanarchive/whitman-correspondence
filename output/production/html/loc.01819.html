            <p class="tei_p">I wonder if young William Allingham wrote it. The Leader

               the young British choir. He is an Irishman <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03023.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03023.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03023.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>and a reverent lover of Emerson's genius. I
               shouldn't wonder if he wrote this critique.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Anyhow it's good and I shall put a great deal of it in.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">If, ever since I have been here, I had not had the worst cold I ever had in my

               this quotation and besides you will like it better by the excision of nearly all the

               sweet country air and relief from labor cleared and refreshed my poor boiled
               brains.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">On my way through New York I enquired at <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Harpers</span> for Curtis
               and found he was out of town. So I brought the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">MS</span> with me
               up here. Then came Curtis' answer; of which I <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03023.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03023.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03023.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>send you a copy that you may see how true
               the reply this splendid gentleman and noble heart sends back to my call.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I really did not expect so much from Curtis. I relied on his literary chivalry, but
               did not look for the rest. As George would say, he has "elements."</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I have written to him saying that I want him to endeavor to find me a publisher and
               mentioning Hurd &amp; Houghton: also saying that in a few days I shall send him the

               here. The landscape is exquisite. Fields, farms, the quiet rustic town, the gorgeous
               foliage, the Temple and Peterboro' hills enclosing all. And then, drive out a few
               miles and lo! Monadnoc! O Walt, what a sight! A purple breadth of mountain, spreading
               calm in sleepy light and filling the landscape with grandeur. It is the finest
               mountain I have seen. Its characteristic is breadth.</p>

               bountiful, generous, cordial, strong, careless, laughing, large, regardless of dress
               or personal appearance, and appreciates or likes <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Leaves of
                  Grass</span>. The first thing she read in the book was <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Enfans

               atmosphere and purport. She is a very particular friend <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03023.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03023.007.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03023.007.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>of mine.

               today that she wanted me to invite you to come up here for a few days before I go,
               but I said I wouldn't because I knew you wouldn't come.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I shall probably leave here about the twenty fifth and go to Boston. Then, home.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Spite of dear friends and respite from the treadmill and the superb October scenery,

            <p class="tei_p">Here, up among the Autumn hills, I get your interesting letter of the 20th and you
               may be very sure that I will do all I can to redress the wrong of which you
               speak.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The task you undertake is not easy, as you know. The public sympathy will be with the
               Secretary for removing a man who will be considered an obscene author and a free
               lover. But your hearty vindication <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03024.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03024.002.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03024.002.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>of free letters will not be the less welcome to all liberal men.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Personally I do not know Whitman; and while his "Leaves of Grass" impressed me less
               than it impressed many better men than I, I have never heard anything of him but what
               was noble nor believed anything of him but what was honorable. That a man should be
               expelled from Office and held up to public contumely, because of an honest book which
               no candid mind can truly regard as hurtful to public morality, <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03024.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03024.003.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03024.003.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>

            <p class="tei_p">I know Carleton but he has several times asked of me favors which I could not grant
               and I do not believe your offer would be strengthened if made through me. If you think otherwise, I shall most cheerfully go to
               him,—but would it not be better for you to write to him and refer him to me,
               saying, if you choose, that you had asked me to call upon him? Think of it and let me
               know.</p>

               railroads, telegraphs and gossip and are just going home. My wife returns your
               friendly remembrance and yours, I hope, has not forgotten me. I should be glad, too,
               if I thought you felt as cheerfully as I feel at the real gain in the Good Fight made
