            <p class="tei_p">Have time &amp; its influences at least helped to calm the terrible loss &amp; shock
                &amp; dislocation? Have you got so that letters and all outside news are <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span>
                altogether painful intrusions? Hoping so I send just a line. (For a while I thought
                it must be some false report—I was in Boston at the time—&amp; waited
                &amp; waited until confirmed.)</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I am as well as any of late years—or perhaps better. My brother &amp; sister
                are well. The Staffords the same. I am writing this in the sunshine up in my old 3d
                story room—Best best love to you &amp; to Herby &amp; Grace—</p>
