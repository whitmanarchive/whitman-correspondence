                    the suicide of Beatrice Gilchrist. On <a href="loc.05096">December 14</a>
                    Anne Gilchrist replied to Whitman: "Your welcome letter to hand. I have longed
                    for a word from you—could not write myself—was stricken
                    dumb—nay, there is nothing but silence for me still." The intensity of her
                    grief is visible in the lines of an undated and unsigned letter: "My dear
                    Children, you would not wish me to live if you knew how I suffered. Not grief
                    alone—that I could learn to bear, to be resigned—but
                    remorse—that I should have left her; that is like an envenomed wound
                    poisoning all my life. 'Weighed &amp; found wanting' am I. And there where I
                    thought myself surest. O the love for her shut up in my heart" (Charles E.
                    Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
                    Congress, Washington, D.C.). Probably Anne had encouraged Beatrice to abandon
                    medicine (see the letter from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of <a href="upa.00072">April 24, 1880</a>). Whitman apparently did not reply
                    to Anne Gilchrist's letter of June 17, in which she apologized for not
                    remembering his birthday: "it was past &amp; I had not written one
                    word—not just put my hand in yours as I would fain always do on that day."
                    In the same letter she invited the poet to visit her: "a snug bed-room ready
                    &amp; waiting for you—as long as ever you will stay with us" (Walt Whitman
                    Collection, 1842–1957, Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, University of
                    Pennsylvania). </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_pml.00051_n3 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="pml.00051_n3"><span>A friend of the
