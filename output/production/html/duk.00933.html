            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Y'r letter came this forenoon &amp; am glad you keep well &amp; are satisfied at y'r
                    occupation—No doubt it will turn out well as
                it is a good business &amp; with ordinary luck will return a handsome
                income—&amp; besides it is y'r own choice &amp; satisfaction—wh' is a
                great point—Nothing very new or different here—If you were to come here
                (&amp; pleas'd w'd I be to see you, boy) now, you w'd see me seated by the oak wood
                fire in the big ratan chair with the gray wolf-skin spread on the back, &amp; the
                same old litter of papers &amp; MSS &amp; books around on the floor in the same old
                muss—I don't get any worse but no improvement in health or strength
                either—but I keep pretty good spirits &amp; eat &amp; sleep fairly
                yet—Have my daily curryings, &amp; get out often in wheel
                chair—Warren has had a couple or three days
                sickness—the doctor was a little afraid of typhoid fever, but it seems to have
                pass'd over, &amp; he is getting ab't the same as before—Mrs: D[avis] is well—I send you a paper—hear from Dr B[ucke] often—he is well &amp; busy—Warren is learning the
                fiddle—he is getting along well—takes lessons of Watson.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Good bye for the present, Ed, &amp; my remembrances &amp; love to you, boy—</p>
