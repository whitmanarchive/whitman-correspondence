        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest Friend:</span>
      </span>
      <p class="tei_p">You have long ere this, I hope, received Herby's letter telling of the safe arrival of the
        precious copy of "Specimen Days," with the portraits: it makes me very proud. Your father
        had a fine face too—there is something in it that takes hold of me &amp; that seems to
        be a kind of natural background or substratum to the radiant sweetness of that other sacred
        &amp; beloved face completing your parentage. I like heartily too the new portraits of you:
        they are all wanted as different aspects: but the two that remain my favourites are the
        portrait taken about 30 without coat of any kind, and the one you sent me in '69—next
        to those I love these two latest—&amp; in some respects better, because they are the
        Walt I saw &amp; had such happy hours with. The second copy of book &amp; my lending one,
        has come safe—too—and the card that told of your attack of illness, &amp; the
        welcome news of your recovery in the Paper; &amp; I have been fretting with impatience at my
        own dumbness—but tied to as many hours a day writing as I could possibly manage, at my
        little book now (last night)—finished, all but proofs, so that I can take my pleasure
        in "Specimen Days" at last; but before doing that must have a few words with you, dearest
        Friend. First a gossip. Do you remember Maggie Lesley? She came to see us on her way to
        Paris, where she is working all alone &amp; very earnestly to get through training as an
        artist—then going to start in a studio of her own in Philadelphia. She, like my
        mother's sister, are to me fine, lovable samples of American women—in whom, I mean, I
        detect, like the distinctive aroma of a flower, something special—that is
        American—a decisive new quality to old-world perceptions. Herby is working away still
        chiefly at the Consuelo picture—has got a very beautiful model to-day sitting to him.
        His summer work was down in Warwickshire, making sketches—&amp; very charming ones
        they are, of George Eliot's native scenes—one of a garden-nook—up steep, old,
        worn stone steps bordered with flowers that is enticing—it will make a lovely
        background for a figure picture.—Giddy's voice is growing in richness &amp;
        strength—&amp; she works with all her heart, hoping one day to be a real artist
        vocally—in church &amp; oratorio music. She will not have power or dramatic ability
        for opera—nor can I wish that she had; there are so many thorns with the roses in that
        path. I fear you will be a loser by Bogne's bankruptcy. Did I tell you that among our
        friends one of your warmest admirers is Henry Holmes, the great violinist (equal [to] Joachim
        some think—we among them). Per. &amp; wife &amp; little grandson all well. My love to
        brother &amp; sister &amp; to Hattie [&amp;] Jessie. Good-bye, dear Walt. I hope to write more &amp;
        better soon.</p>
