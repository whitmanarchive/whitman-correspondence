            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">The American mail this morning brought me three most welcome letters—one from
                Herbert Gilchrist, one from your dear niece, Jessie
                    Whitman, &amp; best of all another kind post card from <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">you</span>, for which I thank you
                very heartily—</p>
            <p class="tei_p">From it I was rejoiced to learn that you were (on Jan 5<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span>)
                apparently so much better in health—"comfortable with me still writing a
                little for publication"—and in such good spirits.</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">I sincerely trust that this improvement will continue <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02459.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.02459.004.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.02459.004.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span> &amp; that there may be no recurrence of

      </span></span> your p.c. to Thos Sharrock, in the Police Court where

                of "The Boys"—is Clerk to the Magistrates Clerk &amp; immediately afterwards I
                took it to J.W.W.'s office. He <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">shewed​ </span><span class="tei_corr">showed​

                Dr Bucke in which the Dr said that he had
                dislocated his left shoulder but was getting on all right with it. He also <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">shewed​ </span><span class="tei_corr">showed​
        
      </span></span> me the letter he is sending you by this mail, in which he pays a

                says that he takes our gift of L of G as a token &amp; a
                further Link of Love between us. He also says:—"I have sent my warmest love to
                W.W. by Wallace. Do you also remember me. I pray I may become worthy of being one of
                his friends &amp; lovers." This desire of Fred's I gladly forward to you, for a more
                loyal &amp; true hearted friend than he, man never had.</p>
