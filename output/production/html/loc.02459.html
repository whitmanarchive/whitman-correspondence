                    worked as a general practitioner in Bolton and as an instructor of ambulance

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke

                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.

                    politics and working-class ideals were often informed by Whitman's work. A
