            <p class="tei_p">As I sit here—the weather is now perfect, day &amp; night—I have jotted off the enclosed &amp; send you—(of course use it or <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">not</span>.) Your letter arrived with the enclosures. I keep well—go out most every day. I suppose you <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">rec'd​ </span><span class="tei_corr">received​
        
      </span></span> the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Tribune</span> (27th I think) with your letter in, which I sent you—&amp; the other papers I occasionally send. No news particular—I sell a book now &amp; then—</p>
            
            <p class="tei_p">No, I have not been to any watering place—they are no company for me—the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">cities</span> magnificent for their complex play &amp; oceans of eager human faces—But the country or sea for me in some sparse place, old barn &amp; farm house—or bleak sea shore—nobody round—Meanwhile I get along very well here—</p>
