                                    Walt Whitman is a poet who refused to be ground in
                    the small mortar of human conventionality. Like Wagner in music, he thought he
                    had a new idea, and resolutely, through a long life, impressed the individuality
                    of that idea on the literature of the new world. It cannot be said that his
                    poetry is good, but it may be maintained that he copied it nowhere. Whether he
                    could write poetry or not, he deserved the thanks of all true Americans for
                    dealing metrical form and ceremony the deadliest blow it has ever received. Such
                    atrocities as Pope's translation of Homer would not be possible in the age of
                    Walt Whitman.—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Chicago Herald.</span>

                    and then spent the 1884–1885 academic year at the University of Michigan
                    studying literature and law. He began to sell books to fund additional study at
                    Union High School in Waukesha, Wisconsin. In 1887, he founded the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Waukesha World</span> newspaper and worked in real estate. For
