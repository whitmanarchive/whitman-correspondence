            <p class="tei_p">I must thank you very cordially for your great kindness in sending me the p.c. of
                Decr 19<span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">th</span> 1890 which I received on New Year's Day.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I cannot tell you how heart-sorry I am to learn that at the time of writing it you
                were so poorly, &amp; I sincerely hope that by this time you are feeling better, &amp; are
                freer from the pain &amp; distress of those internal complications which trouble you.

                While I was saddened by the knowledge that you were suffering physical pain I was deeply touched by the
                fact that in the midst of it all you should kindly think of me &amp; write me such a
                tender &amp; loving note, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart for this act of
                self-denying thoughtful friendliness which I regard as a signal proof of your
                affection for me. God bless you for this &amp; for everything else I owe to you!</p>
            <p class="tei_p">The other day I received a letter from Mrs Harrison of Bideford to whom 
                I sent a copy of my "Notes"—she is a daughter of the late Charles Kingsley &amp; writes under the <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">nom de plume</span> of
                "Lucas Malet"—in which she says:—

                "It is most interesting to get fresh, first-hand impressions of a
                man whom one so deeply admires as I admire Walt Whitman. He is too big, too
                unconventional, ever to become popular, I fancy, either here or in the United
                States. But his thought, filtered through the minds of those few who admire &amp; love
                him, may help to 'leaven the lump,' I hope, as time goes on. I read him with
                increasing sympathy &amp;, I think, profit. But he writes in a language of his own &amp;
                must be understood in a sense of his own;"</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I sent a traced copy of your p.c. to Mr. Wallace &amp; he will
                probably write to you</p>

            <p class="tei_p">By the way it may amuse you to know that in consequence of the extent of my "Whitman
                correspondence" he has jokingly dubbed me "Organising Secretary of the International
                Whitman Society"!</p> 
            <p class="tei_p">We had a pleasant New Year's Day here—a hard frost with crisp, clean
                atmosphere. There is a great Carnival on New Year's Eve among the Bolton people who
                assemble in thousands on the Town Hall
                Square—the great central open space in the town—to listen to the band
                which plays on the Town Hall steps from 11-15 pm until after midnight &amp; upon the last
                stroke of 12 everybody wishes

                everybody else a "Happy New Year," the band then playing "Hail,
                Smiling morn!" &amp; afterwards "Auld Lang Syne," the "Hallelujah Chorus" &amp; "God Save
                the Queen." Then the "fair" begins and the Saturnalia last three days.</p>
