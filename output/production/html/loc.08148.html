                    was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
                    the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
                    Whitman. During the late 1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
                    the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
                    which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden</span> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
                    After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
                    the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,

                    business" is a reference to an 1890s British gambling scandal. In 1890, Sir
                    William Gordon-Cumming, a lieutenant colonel in the Scots Guard was accused of
                    cheating at the card game baccarat. With the knowledge and agreement of then
                    Prince of Wales and later King Edward VII, Gordon-Cumming was confronted and
                    pressured to sign a document that he would not play the game again in exchange
                    for the silence of those in attendance at the home of the ship owner Arthur
                    Wilson. When the news was revealed anyway, Gordon-Cumming claimed he had been
                    the victim of slander. The case was heard in court in June 1891, and the Prince
                    of Wales was compelled to appear as a witness. Gordon-Cumming eventually lost
                    the court case, and he was dismissed from the British Army, although public
                    opinion, at the time, was on his side. Traubel is almost certainly referring to
                    the court proceedings that took place the same month as this letter was
                    written. </span></span> [<a href="#r6">back</a>]</li><li id="n0119">13. <span class="tei_note tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_n0119 note" id="n0119"><span>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
                    Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
                    Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt
                        Whitman</span> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
