            </span>
            <p class="tei_p">Just as my MS pkg was consigned to steamer Roman of the Warren Line, comes crawling
                along—like a fly in molasses— one of Fred. W. Wilson's<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">2</a> idiotic little letters asking to see the MS. before
                    agreeing to give
                me copyright, and assure me seeing of proofs &amp;c—mere trifles. I distrust him, &amp; think him
                incompetent. However, if Gardner<a href="#n4318" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r4318">3</a> declines we will fall back on
                the tortoise. He can't say I did not give him every chance.</p>

                gives parts I omitted, &amp; good ones too.<a href="#n1" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r1">6</a> It is just as I told you: the article is
                strong &amp; adequate. The Dr. in his haste (&amp; I suspect you slyly inveigled him as you
                did me) misses the point twice. Sarrazin does not say that Hegel is the greatest of
                the philosophers <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">after Whitman</span>: he says Hegel is the
                greatest &amp;c <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">according to</span> Whitman. <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">Après</span> means <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">after</span>; but <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">d'après</span> (used by Sarrazin: I saw it in the article at Harvard Library
                again to-day) means <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">according to</span>, or <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">in the opinion of</span>, <span class="underline tei_hi tei_hi_rend_underline">on the authority of</span>, &amp; always
                embodies that idea.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Again our good Dr. misses it in the condor business. Here is Sarrazin: He says where the
                details are removed from Leaves of Grass.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">vous vous apercevez immédiatement que la vie et la variété se sont

                    meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
                    claimed in 1872 that a reading of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> led him
                    to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
