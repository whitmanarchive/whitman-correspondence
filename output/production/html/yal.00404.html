        <span class="tei_salute">Dearest mother,</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I am writing this lying in bed—the doctor wishes me to keep as much in bed as
        possible—but I <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">have</span> to keep in, as I cannot move yet without
        great difficulty, &amp; I am liable to dizziness &amp; nausea, at times, on trying to move,
        or even sitting up—But I am certainly over the worst of it, &amp; <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">really</span>—though slowly—<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">improving</span>. The doctor says
        there is no doubt of it—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Yesterday afternoon I eat something like a meal for the first time—boiled chicken,
        &amp; some soup with bread broken up in it—relished it well—I still have many
        callers—only a few particular ones are admitted to see me—Mrs. O'Connor comes &amp; a young woman named Mary Cole—Mrs. Ashton has sent for me to be brought to her house, to
        be taken care of—of course I do not accept her offer—they live in grand style
        &amp; I should be more bothered than benefitted by their refinements &amp; luxuries, servants, &amp;c—</p>

      <p class="tei_p">Mother, I want you to know truly, that I do not want for any thing—as to all the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">little extra fixings</span> &amp; superfluities, I never did care for them in
        health, &amp; they only annoy me in sickness—I have a good bed—a fire—as
        much grub as I wish &amp; whatever I wish—&amp; two or three good friends
        here—So I want you to not feel at all uneasy—as I write, Peter Doyle is sitting by the window reading—he &amp; Charles
          Eldridge regularly come in &amp; do whatever I want, &amp; are both
          <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">very helpful</span> to me—one comes day time, &amp; one
        evening—I had a good night's sleep last night—My mind is just as clear as
        ever—&amp; has been all the time—(I have not been at all down hearted
        either)—(My January pay is due me, &amp; as soon as I get up, I shall forward you your
          $20.)
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Dear sister Lou,
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">Your letter came this morning &amp; was very pleasant to get it—I shall be getting
        well soon—am on a fair way to it now—</p>

      <p class="tei_p tei_p_rend_right"><span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">latest ½ past 4</span>
      </p>

      <p class="tei_p">I have just set up &amp; had my bed made by Pete—I am already beginning to feel
        something like myself—will write in 2 days—</p>
