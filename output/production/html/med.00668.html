                    Walt Whitman's Washington friends, visited Anne Gilchrist shortly after her
                    arrival in Philadelphia in September, 1876 (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</span> [London: T.F.
                    Unwin, 1887], 228). Marvin had been co-editor of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The
                        Radical</span> in 1866-1867. Later he was employed in the Treasury Department
                    in Washington. On <a href="loc.03656">December 15, 1874</a>, Marvin wrote
                    to Whitman: "I read and re-read your poems, and the 'Vistas,' and more and more
                    see that I had but a faint comprehension of them before. They surpass
                    everything. All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my attention. I read,
                    Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows verses on Summer, in the last Atlantic, and then
                    I read your poem on the Death of Lincoln. It was like listening to a weak-voiced
                    girl singing with piano <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">accompanyment​ </span></span>, and then to an oratorio by the whole Handel Society, with <span class="tei_choice"><span class="tei_sic">accompanyment​ </span></span> by the Music Hall organ." Marvin's veneration of Whitman is also
                    transparent in an article in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Radical Review</span>, I
                    (1877), 224-259. </span></span> [<a href="#r3">back</a>]</li><li id="n2">3. <span class="tei_note tei_note_xml:id_prc.00050_n2 tei_hand tei_note_resp_miller tei_note_type_editorial note" id="prc.00050_n2"><span>This is a reference to
