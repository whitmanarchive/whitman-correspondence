      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I sent you over two months ago (Sept 5), by express prepaid direct to same address as this letter, a package of some 17 or 18 vols 
        of my books, in wrappers, with names on them. As up to this date I have heard nothing of them from you, 
        and Messrs. Strahan have not acknowledged them either, I am a little uneasy about them. Have they arrived?
        Have they been distributed?
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I am jogging along much the same. My limbs still lamed from paralysis—but I get around yet—strength a little more reliable—spirits cheerful.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Your letters of April 18 and 28th were very comforting to me. I have read them several times—&amp; they are before me now.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I wrote to you Sept. 4, announcing the Vols. That was my last. Did it reach you? Your letter of April 28th is the last I have rec'd from you.
      </p>
