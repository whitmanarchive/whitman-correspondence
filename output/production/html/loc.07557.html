            <p class="tei_p">Am better &amp; less better from time to time—worse the afternoon &amp;
                evn'g—or the reverse—But I feel better of the bladder trouble, wh' has
                been my worst affliction this past week—the voiding of water is more
                normal—&amp; I have good or partially good nights, the last three, &amp;
                prospect forthcoming, wh' is a great blessing to me. I am in good
                    spirits—Ed has gone to the p o for
                me,—Horace comes in &amp; tells me the binder Oldach
                promises some finish'd copies (cheap binding) of the big book" next Monday (10th)—So Tuesday I will send you one by mail—T B
                H comes in a few moments—Mrs: H gets on
                first rate—&amp; the baby is immense—</p>

                Had a pretty fair night—the painful irritation, spasms, &amp;c have mainly
                stopt &amp; I am feeling decidedly easier, freer—rose ab't 1½ hours
                ago—have had my partial bath, &amp; quite a decided breakfast—have rec'd
                a note from Dr Osler, proposing that a recommended Dr Walsh
                shall come over daily &amp; sort o' take charge—Of
                course I shall be glad to see Dr W—but I am in hopes the worst of the gland
                ailment is over—&amp; that Osler looking in every week as hitherto will do
                well enough—yours of 6th rec'd &amp; welcomed—I am getting along better
                than you might suppose—To have the trilogy definitively done is a very great
                relief, for I had quite set my heart on putting it in shape &amp; completion, wh' is
                now done, thanks, deepest thanks, to Horace Traubel—As I finish towards 4 the
                day has pass'd fairly well with me, &amp; prospect good for night—</p>
