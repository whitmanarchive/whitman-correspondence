            <p class="tei_p">I have had a sick week—two days pretty bad—last Sunday night had a
                strange chill, rattled me for two hours lively—one or two since but
                milder—the doctor thinks my system has got all chilled through—havnt been out for a week till this evening, went to the post office—am
                feeling better to-day, but weak—</p>

                if it is to come off at all the sooner the better &amp; I hope it will turn out a
                happy marriage,—should say there was the best reason to expect it to, for both
                have estimable qualities &amp; I dont see how a woman can help loving the good man she lives with as a
