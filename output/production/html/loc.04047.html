            </span>

            <p class="tei_p">I have had a sick week—two days pretty bad—last Sunday night had a
                strange chill, rattled me for two hours lively—one or two since but
                milder—the doctor thinks my system has got all chilled through—havnt been out for a week till this evening, went to the post office—am
                feeling better to-day, but weak—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">How are you all? Was glad to have a call from Debbie &amp; your neice Lizzie—So
                Lizzie Hider and Wes are to be married soon—well
                if it is to come off at all the sooner the better &amp; I hope it will turn out a
                happy marriage,—should say there was the best reason to expect it to, for both
                have estimable qualities &amp; I dont see how a woman can help loving the good man she lives with as a
                wife—Best love to Harry, I got his good letter &amp; will answer it
                soon—love to George &amp; all</p>
