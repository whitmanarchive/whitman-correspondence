                fairly with me. Yours of 11th with parallel to Millet
                &amp;c. rec'd. I shall look out for <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">the Nineteenth</span>—Sent off the pesky little notes (more bother than

                you, tho' you probably had it before.</p>
