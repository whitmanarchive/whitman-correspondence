            <p class="tei_p">All my Thought of late, Walt, is of you, and your great work. I read and re-read your

                All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my attention.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I read, Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows<a href="#n0367" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r0367">3</a> verses on Sumner,<a href="#n2" class="internal_link tei_ptr" id="r2">4</a>

                    poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
                    manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
