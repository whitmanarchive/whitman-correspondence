            <p class="tei_p">My friend Morse was much pleased to have your invitation 
                to come, and he intended to do so about this time, but he writes me now that he has 
                unexpectedly been called back to Boston this week.</p>

                to make a special trip to see you just after New-Years. I hope he will, and that he 
                will come to Washington at the same time.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">You said in your last letter you still intended to come to Washington this Winter. So 
                I defer my visit to you. I knew you would not Expect me on the 5th <span rel="tooltip" class="abbr" title="instant​ ">inst</span>​ ,

            <p class="tei_p">My wife and I Earnestly hope we may see you at our house soon.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">All my Thought of late, Walt, is of you, and your great work. I read and re-read your 
                poems, and the "Vistas," and more and more see that I had but a 
                faint comprehension of them before. They surpass every<span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03656.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%252Floc.03656.004_large.jpg/full/!1200,1200/0/default.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="https://whitmanarchive.org/media/iiif/2/whitman-correspondence%2Floc.03656.004_large.jpg/full/!80,80/0/default.jpg" class="display "/></a></span>thing. 
                
                All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my attention.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">I read, Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows verses on Sumner, 
                in the last Atlantic, and then I read your poem on the Death of Lincoln. 
                It was like listening to a weak-voiced girl singing with piano

                I shall have to print the two side by side in my <span class="unclear illegible tei_unclear tei_unclear_reason_illegible tei_unclear_cert_low tei_hand tei_unclear_resp_cb">article</span> 
                if I ever write it. The comparison would be very significant. Trouble with me now is 
                that the subject overpowers me. I am in awe—and dare not put pen to paper.</p>
