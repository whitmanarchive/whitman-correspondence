                    September 28, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter September 30, 1869,
                    and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span> [New York: New York University Press,
                    1961–77], 2:367). Bucke's and Miller's date, however, is incorrect. The
                    letter dates to two years later, to a late-September 1871 visit to Brooklyn from
                    the family of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Mary Van Nostrand. The Van
                    Nostrands came to shop in anticipation of the approaching marriage of Mary's
                    daughter Mary Isadore "Minnie" in October 1871. Louisa had indicated her anxiety
                    regarding the expected visit in her <a href="tex.00172">September
                        15–26, 1871</a> letter to Walt Whitman. A week after this letter,
                    Louisa wrote that her "company is here yet and i dont know how long they will
                    remain" (see her <a href="tex.00180">October 5, 1871</a> letter to Walt
                    Whitman). Based on this letter's consistency with the preceding and the
                    following letters on the Van Nostrands' extended visit, this letter dates to the
                    last Thursday of the month, September 28, 1871. </span></span> [<a href="#r11">back</a>]</li><li id="n3">2. <span class="tei_note tei_note_type_editorial tei_hand tei_note_resp_wwa tei_note_xml:id_duk.00425_n3 note" id="duk.00425_n3"><span>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
