                    a draft letter, evidenced both by the informal signature and the fact that it
                    appears on the reverse of a draft of Whitman's poem, "Others May Praise What
                    They Like," which was first published in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum Taps</span> in
                    1865. Ted Genoways has argued that the letter draft probably dates to late 1879
                    or early 1880, based on the poetry draft (which he thinks was likely an
                    intermediary stage between the poem's publication in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Drum-Taps</span> and its revised appearance in the 1881 edition of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span>) and Whitman's visit to the West that
                    fell in the summer and fall of 1879 (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Correspondence</span>
                    [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004], 57). We have dated the letter
                    earlier, however, thinking it was probably meant for Thayer and Eldridge, since
                    Whitman was eager to have them press for sales of <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of
                        Grass</span> in the west. In his anonymous self-review, "All About a
                    Mocking-Bird," Whitman discussed the forthcoming third edition of 1860: "The
                    market needs to-day to be supplied—the great West especially—with
                    copious thousands of copies" (<span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">New York Saturday Press</span> [7
                    January 1860], 3). </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
