      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Let me by this introduce to you an old and valued friend of mine, J. B. Marvin, who is making a short visit to London on business.</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Marvin is a New Englander, literary, democratic, has a family, and has a position in the Treasury at Washington.</p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">I still continue here, laid up, but working a very little. Best wishes, congratulations etc. on the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">marriage</span>.
        Kindest respects to Mrs. Rossetti. I have lately received a good kind letter from Tennyson.
      </p>
      
      <p class="tei_p">Write soon and freely. I am pretty lonesome here.</p>
