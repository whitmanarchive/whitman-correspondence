            <p class="tei_p">Your good letters come daily—I had quite set on sending you the mare &amp; phæton but
                when I saw (&amp; saw clearly) the situation I resigned to give the scheme up &amp; have
                sold the rig to Rev Mr Corning here (the Unitarian minister) for ab't enough for
                some bills needing payment—O now I feel relieved—</p>

            <p class="tei_p">Nothing particularly different in my sickness—or if anything it is a mild suspicion
                of betterment—Tom Harned was here last evening, &amp; Horace is most faithful &amp;
                invaluable to me, comes every evening, &amp; sees to the printing first rate—It is all
                going on favorably—Morse is in Chicago, working (moderately—writing some) &amp;
                appears to be happy. Herbert Gilchrist has not been over here since—He has some
                plan or art-design I guess—mystified to me so far—Osler is still away—expect him
                back every day—Tennyson sent me his <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Cordial best greetings</span> by H G—he is well—&amp; I
                hear from Ernest Rhys—I am lately looking at Froude's 2d vol. ab't Carlyle "Life in
                London"—the refreshing natural old fault finder of everything &amp; every person &amp;
                writing, including his own utterances ("that cursed book" he calls the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Frederic</span>)—</p>
                <p class="tei_p">It is very moist &amp; clouded &amp; rather warm to-day—after two days and nights quite
                cold—but the <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">summer</span> season is over—I sit here the same—got down yesterday for
                five minutes but hitch'd back soon—Every body is good—"Whatever consists with
                thee," said Marcus Aurelius, "consists with me, O Nature."—Best luck to your meter
                scheme—</p>
