            <p class="tei_p">Mr Walt Whitman, of New York, writes me that he is seeking employment in the public service in Washington, &amp; perhaps some application on his part has already been made to yourself. Will you permit me to say that he is known to me as a man of strong original genius, combining, with marked eccentricities, great powers &amp; valuable traits of character: a self-relying large-hearted man, much beloved by his friends; entirely patriotic &amp; benevolent in his theory, tastes, &amp; practice. If his writings are in certain points open to criticism, they show extraordinary power, &amp; are more deeply American, democratic, &amp; in the interest of political liberty, than those of any other poet.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A man of his talents &amp; dispositions will quickly make himself useful, and, if the government has work that he can do, I think it may easily find that it has called to its side more valuable aid than it bargained for.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With entire respect,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your obedient servant,</p>

                    Emerson wrote to William H. Seward also dated <a href="loc.00760">January
                        10, 1863</a>, Emerson fulfilled Whitman's request when he wrote in a
                    letter from <a href="har.00050">December 29, 1862</a>: "I wish you would
                    write for me something…that I can present, opening my interview with the great
                    man. I wish you to write two copies&#x97;put the one in an envelope directed to
                    Mr. Seward, Secretary of State&#x97;and the other in an envelope directed to Mr.
                    Chase, Secretary of the Treasury&#x97;and enclose both envelopes in the one I
                    send herewith so that I can use either one or the other." Though he was in
                    Rochester, New York, at the time, Emerson, as he noted in a letter on <a href="loc.00761">January 12, 1863</a>
                    , used his Concord
                    address. Ralph Leslie Rusk, in <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">The Letters of Ralph Waldo
                        Emerson</span>, 10 vols. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1939–95),
                    5:302-303, hypothetically reconstructs the two letters which he had not seen,
                    and dates them "c. 2?" Whitman, who, despite his appeal to Emerson, was of two
                    minds as far as an official position was concerned, did not immediately use the
                    recommendations (see the letters from <a href="loc.00764">February 13,
                        1863</a>, and <a href="uva.00345">March 19–20, 1863</a>
                    ). On a wrapper of a
                    copy of the letter to Seward (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Whitman wrote,
                    "never delivered." John Townsend Trowbridge (see Whitman's letter from <a href="med.00304">December 27, 1863</a>) presumably presented the letter
                    to Chase on December 11, 1863. According to Whitman's account of this interview,
                    Chase "said he considered Leaves of Grass a very bad book, &amp; he did not know
                    how he could possibly bring its author into the government service, especially
                    if he put him in contact with gentlemen employed in the beaureaus" (Thomas
                    Donaldson, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Walt Whitman the Man</span> [New York: Francis P.
                    Harper, 1896], 156). Chase, however, kept the letter because he wanted an
                    Emerson autograph; see Trowbridge, <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">My Own Story</span> (Boston:
                    Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1903), 388. The wrapper with this letter to Chase
                    reads: "Clerkship | Walt Whitman | Applicant | New York: | Recommended by | R.
                    W. Emerson | Recd. Jany 28, 1864." According to an entry in a notebook (The
                    Library of Congress #8), a government employee informed Whitman on June 30,
                    1862, that, on seeing <span class="italic tei_hi tei_hi_rend_italic">Leaves of Grass</span> on the table, Chase
                    had asked: "How is it possible you can have this nasty book here?" </span></span> [<a href="#r2">back</a>]</li></ul>
