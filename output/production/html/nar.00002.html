               </span>

            <p class="tei_p">Mr Walt Whitman, of New York, writes me that he is seeking employment in the public service in Washington, &amp; perhaps some application on his part has already been made to yourself. Will you permit me to say that he is known to me as a man of strong original genius, combining, with marked eccentricities, great powers &amp; valuable traits of character: a self-relying large-hearted man, much beloved by his friends; entirely patriotic &amp; benevolent in his theory, tastes, &amp; practice. If his writings are in certain points open to criticism, they show extraordinary power, &amp; are more deeply American, democratic, &amp; in the interest of political liberty, than those of any other poet.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">A man of his talents &amp; dispositions will quickly make himself useful, and, if the government has work that he can do, I think it may easily find that it has called to its side more valuable aid than it bargained for.</p>
            <p class="tei_p">With entire respect,</p>
            <p class="tei_p">Your obedient servant,</p>
