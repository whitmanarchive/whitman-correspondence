                    of December 7 with Whitman (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
                    Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
                    Washington, D.C.). He visited the poet again on June 4, 1884. When Doyle's
                    mother was dying, on May 23, 1885, Whitman sent $10, and he lent Doyle
                    $15 when he came to Camden on June 4, 1885 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). In
                    the 1870s Edward Doyle, like Peter, had been a streetcar conductor. </span></span> [<a href="#r1">back</a>]</li></ul>
