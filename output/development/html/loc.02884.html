   <p>I have been wanting the comfort, of a talk with you dearest Friend, for weeks &amp;
      weeks, without being able to get leisure &amp; tranquillity enough to do it to my 
      hearts
      
       content, indeed 
      hearts
      
       content is not for me at present—but restless, eager longing to
      come—&amp; the struggle to do patiently &amp; completely &amp; wisely what
      remains for me here before I am free to obey the deep faith and love which govern
      me—So let me sit close beside you my Darling—&amp; feel your presence
      &amp; take comfort &amp; strength &amp; serenity from it, as I do, as I can when
      with all my heart &amp; soul I draw close  to you realizing your living presence
      with all my might.—First, about Percy—things are beginning to look a little brighter for him. He is just
      entering upon a new engagement with some very large &amp; successful works—the
      Blenavon Iron Co.—where, though his salary will not be higher at first, his
      opportunities of improvement will be better &amp; he is also to be allowed to take
      private practice (in assaying &amp; analyzing). The manager there believes in
      Science &amp; is friendly to Percy &amp; will
      give him every facility for showing what he can do, so that he hopes to prove to the
       Directors before
      long that he is worth a good salary. The parents of Norah (whom he loves) have
      released from their unfriendly attitude since my Beatrice has been staying with him, the two
      girls have attached themselves to one another &amp; 
      Per.
      
       has had delightful opportunities of being with Norah, &amp; best of all
      she is to return <u>here</u> with Beatrice (they are coming
      to–morrow) &amp; 
      Per.
      
       is to have a 
      weeks
      
       holiday &amp; come up, so that he &amp; Norah will be wholly together
      &amp; have I suspect, the happiest week they have yet had in their lives. Then I
      have stored away for them the furniture of the dear old home at Colne &amp; I really
      think that by the time 
      /76 is out they will be able to marry. I see, and indeed I have known ever since he
      formed this attachment, that I must not look for him to come to America with me. But
      what I build upon dearest Friend is that when I have been a little while in America
      &amp; have made friends &amp; had time to look about me I might hear of a good
      certainty for him— his excellent training at the [

         ?</span>]
      
      
      
      Sch.
      
       of Mines, large experience at Blenavon energy ability &amp; sturdy
      uprightness will make him a first rate manager of works by &amp; bye.  But the leaving him so
      happy with his young wife will make it easier for us to part—<em>Nov.</em> 26—Beatrice has begun
      to work at anatomy at the School of Medicine for Women lately founded, &amp; seems
      to delight in her work. She will not enter on the full course all at once—I am
      for taking things gently. Women have plenty of strength but it is of a different
      kind from 
      mens
      
       &amp; must work by gentler &amp; slower means—Above all I do not
      like what pushes violently aside domestic duties &amp; pleasures. The special work
      must combine itself with these; I am sure it can. Herby is
      getting on very nicely, never did student love his work better. He is eager, &amp;
      by making the best use of present opportunities &amp; advantages  yet looking towards
      America full of cheerful hopes &amp; sympathy. Grace is
      less developed in intellect but not less in character than the others. I can't
      describe her but [
      <span class="unclear">send you
         her photograph. There</span>]
       is a freshness &amp; independence of character
      about her—yet withal a certain waywardness &amp; reserve. She is a good
      instinctive judge of character—more influenced by it than by books—yet
      with a growing taste for them too. She comes to America with a gay and buoyant
      curiosity, declining to make up her mind about anything till she gets there. We want
      as far as possible  to
      transplant our home bodily—to bring as much as we can of our own furniture
      because we have beautiful old things precious in Herby's eyes &amp; that we are all
      fond of. And coming straight to Philadelphia &amp; taking a house somewhere on the
      outskirts of it or Camden immediately we fancy this might be practicable, but have
      not yet launched into the matter—I have just heard from Mr. Rossetti, &amp; also from
      Mrs. Conway of her 
      husbands
      
       having seen you, &amp; if
      his report be not too sanguine it is a cheering one &amp; would comfort me much
      dearest Friend. But what he says is so favourable I am afraid to believe it  altogether, knowing
      that you would make the very best of yourself &amp; indeed be probably at your best
      with the pleasure of seeing an old friend fresh from England &amp; also that he is
      [
      <span class="unclear">sanguine?</span>]
      .
      
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Nov.</em> 30. And now, dear Friend,
      I have had a very great pleasure indeed, thanks to you—a visit from Mr.
      Marvin—&amp;  hope to have another when he
      returns from Paris. And the account he gives of you is so cheerful—so
      vivid—it seems to part assunder a gloomy cloud that was brooding in my mind.
      And though I know that for the short hours that you feel bright &amp; well are many
      long hours when you are far otherwise, still I feel sure those short hours are the
      earnest of perfect recovery—with a fine patience—boundless patience. And
      now I can picture you sitting in your favourite  window, having a friendly word with
      passers by—&amp; feel quite sure that you are happy &amp; comfortable in your
      surroundings. And a great deal else full of interest Mr. Marvin told me. I was loth
      for him to go, but one hour is so small we have noticed for a friend I am sorry to
      say. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>William Rossetti has a little girl which is a great delight to him. Miss Hillard
      of Brooklyn has also paid me a visit &amp; spoken to me of you. She charmed
       me much—only I felt a little cross with her for giving
      Herby such a dismal account of his chances as an artist in America—  However we both refused
      to be discouraged, for after all he can send his pictures to England to be
      established &amp;c., having plenty of friends who would see to it; &amp; we are both
      firm in the faith that if you can only paint the really good pictures the rest will
      take care of itself somehow or other—&amp; that can be done as well in America
      as in England—but of course he must finish his training here—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
