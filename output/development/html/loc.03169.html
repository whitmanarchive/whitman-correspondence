   <p>Did you see my snow study "Tumultuous Privacy,["] last monday in Transcript for
      6?<sup><a href="#loc.03169_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Every emendation of yrs is good. I rather doubted at first yr sub=head. But I
      guess it's better than mine, (wh' was too big=headed for the main structure).
      Your other touches give accuracy to my over=statements. Really I was unfit to
      treat the subject[.] Howsoever, we've <u>together</u> hammered
      out a bit of wrought=iron work of some value. I never said anything just like it
      for fact=iness. The thing grew upon both of us, as we went on. Somebody ought to
      write a scholarly=picturesque thorough &amp; exhaustive history of the
      Dutch=Americans. I wish I were rich enough. I wd— go to Albany &amp; the
      pastoral horse=raising regions of New York State, &amp; to N.Y. City &amp; L.
      Island, &amp; study the <u>Dutch</u> people at first hand. I
      remember years ago I had a splendid <u>clean</u> young Dutch
      commerical fellow as a pupil in Brooklyn, N.Y. I taught him English through the
      medium chiefly of German.

   <p>I'm afraid with that rebellious bowel business your experience must be something
      like that of an old Scotchman I heard of who was opposed to having water closets
      in the middle of a house.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
