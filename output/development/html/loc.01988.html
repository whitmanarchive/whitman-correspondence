      <br></br><br></br>Walt Whitman,
      <br></br>Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sunday Evening has come around again and I find myself again employed in the pleasant
      duty of answering one of your ever welcome letters. I rec'd yours of Jan 31st
      last night, and will not lose any time in answering it this time, but I do not know
      as you will approve of my writing on Sundays, but that is about the only time I have
      for writing except evenings and then my hands tremble so from my work (which is
      nearly all done by the hands) that I can scarcely write 
      inteligibly
      
       so I feel certain you will excuse me.  I also received your "Leaves" of
      "Grass" and the pamphlet the "Good" "Gray"
      Poet, which I shall prize so highly that no money could purchase
      it but I do not know as you ought to have sent it to me for I do not know as you
      could afford it, but I will try and repay you for it, if in no other way than Love
      which I can give from the heart.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The vindication I have read part of it and Father has read the
      rest of it to us, and I shall take the liberty of disagreeing with you in regard to
      his thinking more of you than you deserve for you deserve his love as well as that
      of thousands of others myself included, and I wish you to give him my best regards
      and tell him I am one [illegible] of friends
      that that was visited  in Armory Square Hospital by his Good, Gray,
      Poet, Walt Whitman, and that I hope some day to make his acquaintance in person. I
      think Mr O'Connor was perfectly sane in writing his vindication, and I thank you
      very much for sending it to me for it has done me good already.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I get to thoroughly reading your Book I shall probably have some questions to
      ask but I shall not get as bigoted as Secretary Harlan, and wish to
      turn you out of employment for your plainness of speech for I have failed as yet to
      find any indecent passages.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been talking and thinking very strongly of going to South America next spring
      to be gone a year or two and see if I could not get into  something there that would be of
      benefit to me financially. I have not decided what part of the country I would go
      to
      yet and I want to get your advice on the subject for I am not very well posted. Give
      me your opinion freely, and say whatever you wish to say on any subject. If I should
      go I would try to spend a day or two with you in Washington
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will try and give you a better letter next time I write, for I am not in very good
      writing mood 
      to night
      
      . enclosed is some cards Fac Simile of those I sent you in the letter you
      did not get. I did not know but you would like to have them.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The friendship of Walt Whitman
      with this former soldier can be reconstructed from Benton H. Wilson's
      letters in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection. On , Wilson recalled his confinement in Armory Square
      Hospital (as mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Lewis K. Brown), "when your kind face
      &amp; pleasant words cheered the soldier Boys &amp; won their hearts. I
      never shall forget the first time you came in after David &amp; I got there.
      We Loved you from the first time we spoke to you." In Wilson's first letter,
      written on , he began: "I
      suppose you will think that I have forgotten you long before this time but I
      have not, your kindness to me while in the hospital will never be forgotten
      by me." After a lapse in the correspondence, he wrote on : "I wish if aggreable to
      yourself to keep up a regular correspondence between us ... I think it will
      be of benefit to me morally, and perhaps will not be of any detriment to
      you." In this letter he admitted that he had just discovered that Walt
      Whitman was a poet. On , he
      informed Walt Whitman that he had been reading <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, but complained: "I wrote to you a year and more ago that I
      was married but did not receive any reply, so I did not know but you was
      displeased with it"; he concluded the letter: "I remain as ever yourBoy
      Friendwith LoveBenton H. Wilson." Walt Whitman replied (lost), and
      sent <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>, which Wilson acknowledged on
      . On , after he informed Walt Whitman
      that his wife had gone to the hospital for her first confinement (the child
      was to be named Walt Whitman), Wilson complained: "I am poor and am proud of
      it but I hope to rise by honesty and industry. I am a married man but I am
      not happy for my disposition is not right. I have got a good Woman and I
      love her dearly but I seem to lack patience or something. I think I had
      ought to live alone, but I had not ought to feel so." On , Wilson acknowledged Walt
      Whitman's reply of : "I do not
      want you to misunderstand my motives in writing to you of my Situation &amp;
      feelings as I did in my last letter or else I shall have to be more guarded
      in my letters to you. I wrote so because you wanted me to write how I was
      situated, and give you my mind without reserve, and all that I want is your
      advice and Love, and I do not consider it cold lecture or dry advice. I wish
      you to write to me just as you feel &amp; express yourself and advise as
      freely as you wish and will be satisfied." On , Wilson wondered why Walt Whitman had not
      replied.<br><br>
      In his letter of , Wilson
      reported that he had moved to Greene, N. Y., but was still selling melodeons
      and sewing machines (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). On , Wilson informed Walt Whitman of
      his father's death two weeks earlier and related that his son "Little Walt
      ... is quite a boy now ... and gets into all kinds of Mischief." Benton's
      father, who "was insane at times," had written to Walt Whitman on , and on  (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). Evidently Wilson wrote to Walt Whitman for the last time on
      June 23, 1875, when he wanted to know "what I can do to contribute to your
      comfort and happiness" (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York
      Public Library).
