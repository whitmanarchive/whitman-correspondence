   <p>Yours of 5<u>th/</u> and 6<u>th/</u><sup><a href="#loc.07771_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      came to hand this a.m. The little piece to "The year '89"
      enclosed. It is fierce and strong, do not see where (in your condition) the force
      comes from to write such lines so savage and bitter with their double and treble
      meaning.<sup><a href="#loc.07771_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I trust you are (even if "very very
      slowly") gaining and am glad to have you say that you believe in my diagnosis of
      letter of 24<u>th</u> Dec.<sup><a href="#loc.07771_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> If you can only be sure and not take
      more than the system can day by day dispose of (and excrete the waste from), you may
      do pretty well for a long time. The fault is not that you eat too much—(I do
      not suppose you are inclined to eat more than would be good for you) but that your
      excretary organs (especially bowels &amp; kidneys) are in such poor trim. I note
      what you say of Sylvester Baxter's<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r5">5</a></sup> criticism in Boston Herald.<sup><a href="#loc.07771_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> He has not sent me a copy and I have not seen it
      yet—I hope either you or Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r7">7</a></sup> will send it me at once. The big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r8">8</a></sup> ought
      to be on the market. When will it be? Binding I suppose not settled upon yet?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07771_n1">1. Five of Bucke's letters
      to Whitman (8 January 1889, 20 January 1889, 28 April 1890, 24 August 1890, and
      6 March 1891) were miscatalogued as being from Bucke to Traubel. Edwin Haviland
      Miller has not listed these letters in his "Calendar of Letters Written to
      Whitman" (<em>The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman: The
         Correspondence, Volume 4</em>, 428-441; <em>Volume 5</em>,
      333-349).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07771_n4">4. Bucke is referring to a
      lost letter. For Lozynsky's reconstruction see <em>The Letters of
         Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Artem Lozynsky (Detroit:
      Wayne State University Press, 1977), 98-99.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">5. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">8. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r8">[back]
