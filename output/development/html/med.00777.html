   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00777_n1">1. The Camden Horse
      Railroad Company, constructed in 1871 and expanded through the 1880s, was the
      city's first attempt to connect inland parts of Camden with the ferryboats. The
      lines were converted to electricity in 1889.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="med.00777_n2">2. Whitman used the verso
      of this draft as a mailing label for S. R. Henderson's copy of <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), sent on December 23, 1890. The
      label reads: "S R Henderson | p o box 838 | Los Angeles | California | f'm Walt
      Whitman | Camden | New Jersey." Henderson appears to have noted receipt of the
      package on December 30, as "12-30" appears in pencil in another hand.<a href="#r2">[back]
