   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thy postal card of ten days ago has just came. It is so good of thee to write. I am
      ashamed when I think how long a silence I have kept—yet I have thought of thee
      very often I have been so busy—"facilis decensus"—into
      politics!—and when once there, it is hard to get out. Of course the one miserable thing
      occupying the political field is Parnell's incredible meanness. He has dealt the
      death blow to Home Rule in this generation, I am afraid. I feel so sorry for the
      many Liberals whose one cry and interest has been Home Rule. It is not so unhappy
      for me, because for several years <u>all</u> my work has been
      given to what seems to me infinitely more interesting than the machinery of
      politics—the reform of existing social abuses, such as the overwork &amp;
      underpay &amp; the generally wretched conditions under which the poor live—The
      collapse of Home Rule will bring <u>these</u> questions much more
      to the front, but I think it means a Liberal defeat at the next election, as the
      Party is not prepared.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel quite in the vein of writing a volume of newspaper "leaders" on the subject,
      but I will refrain!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>We are all so well—children &amp; all. Ray<sup><a href="#n3137" id="r1">1</a></sup> goes to a
      little
      Kindergarten school every day. Frank<sup><a href="#n3133" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I are going to spend
      our Xmas holiday at Rome, if all goes well.
   </p>
   
   <p>Father<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r3">3</a></sup> is undergoing transformation into the "Country Squire" of
      fiction. He is wrapt up in "the place" at Haslemere, spends most of his time
      there.
   </p>
   
   <p>Many thanks for all the papers, which greet me from time to time with a sight of thy
      hand writing.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
