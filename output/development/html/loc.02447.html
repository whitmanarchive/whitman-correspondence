      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many thanks to you for your kind letter dated Sept 13<u>th</u>
      1890 and for the two letters from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> to you which I will
      return by next mail.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad to hear such a good account of your health and I hope it may continue to
      improve
   </p>
   
   <p>Thanks too for the domestic details and glimpses into your daily life which you favor
      me with, all of which possess a genuine and deep interest for me and which serve to
      vivify and deepen the ever-present and ineradicable image + memory of yourself and your surrounding and
      to recall the numerous + [illegible]
      kindnesses you had shewed me
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Dr Bucke's letters are extremely interesting but two paragraphs are of especial
      interest to us here The first is that "Horace" (?H. L. Traubel)<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      is preparing a new book about you—"W W to date." Will you please kindly order
      <u>two</u> copies for me + I will forward the cash when I
      know the price?
   </p>
   
   <p>The second is that he (Dr B) will probably be in England before so long + will call
      +
      see "Johnston Wallace + Co! (It sh<u>d</u> be W. J. + Co!) This
      is news indeed! There is none of your friends whom I would like more to see than he
      + there is no place
      where he would receive a warmer welcome than in Bolton among "the boys." We are none
      of us wealthy but such as we have would be at his disposal during his stay among us.
      We have had many "Whitman evenings" but a "Whitman Evening" with Dr. Bucke—the
      [illegible] would be the climax of all +
      a life long remembrance. The thought of it is almost enough to take one's breath
      away—Let us hope it may not prove "too good to be true"!
   </p>
   
   <p>Our birthday "Surprise party" came off very successfully on the 25<u>th</u> and it proved to be a veritable surprise to our <u>victim</u> the Revd F. R. C. Hutton MA who had not the slightest suspicion
      of our intentions although his own wife was in the plot and had prepared a grand
      supper "on the sly." Our arrival in a body surprised him, the [illegible] of a reading-machine
      inscribed—"to the Revd F. R. C. Hutton M. A.—'Something for a token'
      from the boys of the College" astonished him; but the presentation of the pocket
      book copy of L. of G. with an inscription—"to the Revd F. R. C. Hutton MA with
      all good wishes from the boys of the College and from Walt Whitman" fairly
      overwhelmed him.
   </p>
   
   <p>The inscription is a most artistic piece of work and the bordering is a beautifully
      executed design in leaves of grass, wild flowers + "straw coloured + other psyches"
      the whole being the work of W. M. [
      <span class="unclear">Land?</span>]
       one of "the boys" + a clever draughtsman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_97.html">Johnston, Dr. John (d.1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
