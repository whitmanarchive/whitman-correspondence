      <br></br><br></br>Dear John—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have adopted your suggestion &amp; written (same mail with this) to Wm. Swinton, Ward, Dr. Seeger, Stedman, [J.]
      Miller, Mr. Jardine—I am entirely satisfied with your letter, (as with Buchanan's
      and Rossetti's action in London.)<sup><a href="#med.00455_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am pleased well with what you write me in, &amp; are doing by, your letter . . . Things
      go on with me much
      the same as usual of late . . . When you see any thing <em>notable</em> or pungent about me or my affairs,
      send it to me, as I neither see or hear much here.
   </p>

      In April 1876, Whitman, with the assistance of friends in America and abroad,
      began a promotional campaign for the sale of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> (sixth edition) and <em>Two Rivulets</em>. John
      Swinton suggested that a circular be sent to his brother William, John
      Quincy Adams Ward, Dr. Ferdinand Seeger, Edmund Clarence Stedman, Joaquin
      Miller, and D. Jardine, most of whom ordered copies of the books. See also
      the notes to Whitman's  letter
      to various friends. <br><br>
      Swinton reported Whitman's "penury" in an article in the New York <em>Herald</em> on April 1, 1876. Robert Buchanan and William
      Michael Rossetti made appeals to English admirers to relieve the poet's
      poverty. <a href="#r2">[back]
