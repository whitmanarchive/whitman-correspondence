      sell the horse<sup><a href="#n4142" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Harned would attend to it—it will be just as cheap to
      hire by &amp; by when you want to go out—if that time comes. As the  matter stands the horse
      is eating her head off and taking harm from want of exercise.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">3. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.07214_n2">4. This letter from Harned
      enclosing the memorandum from Donaldson probably concerns Bucke's circular (see
      Bucke's letter to Whitman of ).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07214_n3">6. Dr. Nathan M. Baker
      stopped being Whitman's caregiver on July 15, 1888, and was replaced by W. A.
      Musgrove. Musgrove was far less satisfactory than Baker. Traubel noted that
      "Musgrove is a cloudy man. I asked how M. got on. W. evaded the question by some
      general remark. . . . He [Musgrove] is only a nurse—not a doctor" (Horace
      Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
