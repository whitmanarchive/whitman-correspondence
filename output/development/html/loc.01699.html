   <p>I send herewith the copy of my American Institute Poem. It will be plain sailing,
      if you
      have a careful printer &amp; proof reader.<sup><a href="#n0512" id="r1">1</a></sup> I think an ordinary
      12 mo would be best, and send you a sample, my idea of size of page, and sort of
      pamphlet-volume to be made. As to size of type for the poem, if English solid would
      not be
      too large, I would like to have that. If you think it too large, take the next smaller
      size.
      In binding let the edges remain uncut, &amp; bind in the kind of paper according to sample.
      See sample of title on cover. Send the revised proofs to me by mail, directed to this
      city,
      and I will promptly return them. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My percentage &amp;c. I leave to you to fixâ€”I should expect two or three dozen
      copies. I reserve the copyright to myself. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>That the papers have freely printed &amp; criticized the piece will much help, as it awakes
      interest &amp; curiosity, &amp; many will want to have it in good form to keep. The demand
      will grow. I have no authority to speak for them, but I think the American Institute
      will
      want several hundred copies, &amp; that the pamphlet will have a sale at all their public
      Exhibitions &amp; Fairs. They always have book stands at them. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It ought to be put in hand immediately, &amp; out soon. </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0512">1. The Roberts Brothers firm was established in
      Boston in 1863. Though it introduced such authors as Dante Gabriel Rossetti,
      William Morris, Joaquin Miller, Oscar Wilde, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Emily
      Dickinson, it became famous for the works of Louisa May Alcott. <em>After All, Not to Create Only</em> was the only work of Walt
      Whitman that the firm published. It has been suggested that Bronson Alcott
      persuaded Roberts to undertake the work; see Raymond L. Kilgour, <em>Messrs. Roberts Brothers, Publishers</em> (1952), 107. The
      house merged with Little, Brown and Co. in 1898.<a href="#r1">[back]
