   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00429_n17">1. 
      Although Louisa Van Velsor Whitman provided no clear clue about the date of
      this letter in her own hand, a wide range of contextual matters, some
      conflicting, make it possible to date this letter to a range between
      September 5 and September 23, 1863. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the
      approximate date November 1, 1863 on an accompanying slip of paper in the
      Trent Collection (not reproduced here). Edwin Haviland Miller dated this
      letter September 3, 1863 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:144–145, n. 33). Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M.
      Price dated this letter both September 10? and September 15?, 1863 (see
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's  and  letters
      to Walt Whitman).<br><br>
      Louisa either enclosed a letter from George Washington Whitman or had
      recently forwarded a letter from him with her previous letter (her
      postscript is ambiguous). As mail from George when he was stationed in
      Kentucky took approximately a week to reach Brooklyn (but often longer),
      Louisa may have enclosed George's  letter. If a letter from George was enclosed with this or
      with Louisa's previous letter to Walt (not extant), the approximate range of
      dates for this letter extends from September 12 to September 23. A letter
      preceding George's September 7 letter, or an intermediate letter from
      George, may be lost, but Walt in his  letter to Louisa wished for news from George: Walt's receipt
      of this letter from Louisa with George's letter enclosed thus rules out a
      date after September 23, 1863. This approximate range of dates (September 5
      to September 23) is corroborated by topics in Jeff Whitman's September 24,
      1863 letter to Walt, though some topics in Louisa's letter may suggest an
      earlier date.<br><br>
      Louisa was in sharp disagreement with Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman over assistance that they could, or should, extend to the
      family of Andrew Jackson Whitman. Jeff and Mattie were willing to provide
      more nourishing food for Andrew because they feared neglect could contribute
      to his death, but Jeff and Mattie refused to provide direct aid to Andrew's
      wife Nancy and their children. Louisa challenged Jeff and Mattie to be more
      generous to James "Jimmy," Andrew and Nancy's son. Jeff and Mattie insisted
      that Louisa should use her "bank book"—her deposits of George's
      military pay—if she wished to assist Jimmy. Jeff charged Louisa with
      mistaken notions of economy—she scrimped on the food for herself and
      sons Jesse and Edward when George's military pay could provide relief.<br><br>
      Because Louisa again discussed the expense of Andrew's two drunken
      sprees—$30 and $10—on the heels of his recovery from a
      debilitating episode of pleurisy, this letter could date to near Louisa's
       letter to
      Walt, in which Andrew's two sprees are mentioned with a sense that the
      second spree occurred within the past week. Jeff's suggestion—bringing
      Andrew into the Portland Avenue home, which Louisa rejected—also
      appears in Jeff's  letter to
      Walt. The parallel between Jeff's suggestion on Andrew and Louisa's
      rejection of it may have prompted Miller's early September 3, 1863 date for
      this letter, but Louisa's reference to Jeff's suggestion in this letter is
      perfunctory, as a matter that she had long dismissed from consideration.
      Because no pattern of consistencies among topics is predominant, the letter
      is assigned to a date range from September 5 to September 23, 1863.<br><br>
      Louisa's  letter
      to Walt almost certain follows this one, and October 2 is a more likely date
      for that letter. However, if that letter dates to September 25 rather than
      October 2, this letter is likely to date earlier in the range of possible
      dates, to no later than September 18. The parallel passages with Jeff's  and  letters to Walt are annotated, and readers may
      judge for themselves which parallels offer the most convincing evidence for
      assigning this letter within the range from September 5 to September 23,
      1863.

   <p id="duk.00423_n3">2. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew developed a drinking problem that contributed
      to his early death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, who was
      pregnant with son Andrew, Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James
      "Jimmy." For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00423_n4">3. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the wife of Walt Whitman's brother, Andrew Jackson Whitman. James "Jimmy" and
      George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was pregnant with
      Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. Andrew, Jr., died in 1868,
      and Georgy died in 1872. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed.,

   <p id="duk.00429_n8">4. The euphemism "went in the
      country" refers to one of Andrew Whitman's extended drinking episodes after he
      recovered from pleurisy. This letter includes brief remarks on both episodes.

      Andrew's wife Nancy McClure Whitman. For more on Andrew's family, see Jerome M.

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00429_n22">6. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman criticized Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's diet and her unwillingness to
      spend money on food for herself and her sons Jesse and Edward: "Even to day she
      has 25 or $30 in the house and I will bet that all they have for dinner will be
      a quart of tomats and a few cucumbers, and then Mother wonders why Jess vomits
      up his meals However Mother gets them just as good or better than she has
      herself" (see Jeff's  letter to
      Walt Whitman). Walt seconded Jeff's advice in his  letter:"Mother, I hope you will live
      better—Jeff tells me you &amp; Jess &amp; Ed live on poor stuff, you are
      so economical—Mother, you mustn't do so, as long as you have a
      cent—I hope you will at least four or five times a week have a steak of
      beef or mutton, or something substantial for dinner."<a href="#r6">[back]

      of Andrew Jackson Whitman's drinking "spree," see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's

   <p id="duk.00429_n9">8. The last word on the line is
      either "their" or "then." Louisa contracted the letters as she approached the
      right margin of the page.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">9. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00429_n6">10. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. Though
      he was willing to aid Andrew Jackson Whitman, Jeff rejected offering any
      assistance to his wife Nancy or their children: "I dont think myself that we
      have any thing to do with Nancy, she is able enough to make a good living both
      for herself and the children, if she wasnt so dam'd lazy" (see his  letter to Walt). Jeff in early
      adulthood worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer, and in the 1850s he
      began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="duk.00429_n11">11. Mattie's refusal to provide
      a shirt to James "Jimmy," son of Andrew and Nancy McClure Whitman, was
      consistent with her husband Jeff Whitman's opinion (see previous note).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00429_n24">12. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      was thrifty because she desired to preserve George Washington Whitman's military
      pay as much as possible for his use. A comment in Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa, which refers to a
      letter that is not extant, suggests that Walt hoped to counteract Louisa's pride
      in her thriftiness with George's money. Walt enlisted George himself to pressure
      Louisa to spend more freely: "I sent him enclosed your letter before the last,
      though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted
      to surprise him, but I sent it." Though George's  letter is extant, the most recent letter that he had received
      then from his family was a non-extant September 28 letter from Walt. In the next
      extant letter from George, , which
      followed Andrew Whitman's death, George pressed his mother to "dont be the least
      backward in useing the money for anything you want" and to "do all, that is
      required for, Andrews Family."<a href="#r12">[back]

      is either "hn" or "hu" for "hundred."<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n7">15. "Sis" is Manahatta "Hattie"
      Whitman (1860–1886), the elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven
      years of her life in the same home as Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially
      close to her grandmother. The nickname "Sis" would eventually pass from
      Manahatta to her younger sister Jessie Louisa, the latter born in June 1863.
      Hattie and Jessie were both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00429_n28">16. "Mattie has, I think very
      kindly, volunteered to cook and take care of [Andrew], and I feel that he could,
      in a short time, be fixed up so that he could carry out the Dr's idea. But
      Mother, says that she cant let him have the room, because it will bring his
      whole family here" (see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r16">[back]

   <p id="duk.00429_n26">17. Greenport is a seaport
      village near the end of the northern fork of Long Island, New York. It was the
      home of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's daughter Mary Whitman Van Nostrand and
      family, but Louisa mentions it here proverbially as a distance that Andrew

      Nancy's "econimy" in the sense of her financial means, the only time that the
      word appears in her correspondence, may derive from Jeff's criticism of Louisa's
      "economy." Jeff wrote to Walt that "Mother is following a mistaken notion of
      economy" in his  letter.<a href="#r18">[back]

   <p id="duk.00429_n29">19. Mattie was a skilled
      seamstress who had engaged in contract sewing to supplement Jeff's income,
      and Robert Roper has determined that Jeff and Mattie had purchased an
      expensive sewing machine (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New
      York: Walker, 2008], 92–93).<br><br>
      Like Whitman scholars who have followed, neither Jeff nor Louisa extended
      sympathy to Andrew's wife Nancy McClure Whitman, whom Louisa described as
      dirty and as being on the street (see her  and her  letters to Walt). Gay Wilson Allen referred to Nancy's
      "extravagance," repeated Louisa's adjectives "dirty, ugly, and lazy," and
      referred to Nancy's being in the street as "misconduct" (<em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em>, revised
      edition, [New York: New York University Press, 1967], 304, 306, 308). Even
      if Nancy was judged an inadequate housekeeper by the standards of Louisa and
      Mattie, Louisa's and Jeff's letters provide hints that the combination of
      Andrew's drinking sprees, his expensive medical treatments (see Jeff's  letter to Walt), and Nancy's
      pregnancy rendered her and her children financially vulnerable. The
      financial strain that both Jeff and Louisa assumed for Andrew's illness and
      approaching death and their fears for George may have inured them to Nancy's
      suffering.<br><br>
      Their attitude toward Nancy may have been entwined with their ethnic
      prejudice toward Irish immigrants. After the New York City draft riots, Jeff
      gave vent to his hatred for Irish immigrants: "I hear that [Michigan
      Regiments] made fearful havoc with the irish ranks. Twas better
      so—they did not have that 'citizen feeling' that our militia would
      have had. The only feeling I have is that I fear that they did not kill
      enough of 'em Walt. I'm perfectly rabid on an Irishman I hate them worse
      than I thought I could hate anything" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt Whitman). Louisa in her  letter speculated that one
      positive result of the Franco-Prussian War would be if it inspired some
      Irish immigrants to leave the United States.<a href="#r19">[back]

      the son of Walt Whitman's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman and Andrew's wife Nancy
      McClure Whitman. For more on Andrew's family, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

   <p id="duk.00429_n13">21. "mrs more" is E. D. Moore,
      the spouse of John Moore, an iron founder, who lived on Myrtle Avenue. Louisa
      probably refers to Hampden Street—there is no "hampton"—which
      intersects Myrtle Avenue near Washington Park.<a href="#r21">[back]

      probably enclosed a letter from George Washington Whitman with this letter, but
