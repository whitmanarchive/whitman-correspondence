   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00659_n1">1. This letter dates to
      December 3, 1872. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter Tuesday. A note on
      the first page in Walt Whitman's hand dated it December 3, 1872, a Tuesday.
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with the assigned date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:369). The assigned date is corroborated by multiple details in
      the letter and is correct. Louisa, who was in Camden, New Jersey, had received a
      money order from Walt to pay Edward's board to Louisa Orr Whitman, so the letter
      must date in the first week of a month. The holiday Thanksgiving has just
      passed, so the month is December. And George Washington Whitman's most recent
      stint as an inspector for the Brooklyn Water Works has come to an end, also
      consistent with December 1872.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n2">2. Louisa Orr Haslam
      (1842–1892), called "Lou" or "Loo," married George Washington Whitman in
      spring 1871. At the insistence of George and his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward departed from Brooklyn to live
      with George and Lou at 322 Stevens Street in Camden in August 1872. When Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward began living with George and Lou, Walt Whitman
      sent his mother $20 per month, $15 for Edward's board (see Walt's  and  letters to Louisa).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n3">3. Elijah Bruce (b. 1808) and
      Ruth Bruce (b. 1812) were the parents of Grace Haight (b. 1839), and they were
      neighbors near Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's residence at 71 Portland Avenue (see
      <em>United States Census, 1880</em>, New York, Brooklyn,
      Kings; and Helen Price's October 13, 1872 letter to Louisa [Trent Collection,
      Duke University]). The 1871 <em>Brooklyn City Directory</em> lists
      Elijah Bruce, surveyor, at 90 Portland Avenue. Grace Haight's familiar and
      chatty  letter to Louisa shows
      that they were quite close friends (Feinberg Collection, Library of
      Congress).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n4">4. This Adams is presumably a
      Brooklyn City Works Commissioner named Henry Adams, who is listed as a
      commissioner in a Brooklyn public call to property owners on the opening and
      altering of water lines on Lee Avenue ("Notice," <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, December 5, 1872, 1). Adams is also named as a
      commissioner in another letter (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n14">5. In early 1873, George
      Washington Whitman inspected pipe at Star's Foundry (Walt wrote "Starr's") in
      Camden, New Jersey. For a few months he had no work through the Brooklyn Water
      Works. George made multiple trips to Brooklyn in early 1873 to seek additional
      work inspecting pipe and secured another job (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
       letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n13">6. George Washington Whitman's
      plan for a new house was delayed for only a few months. Between early March and
      mid-April 1873, George purchased a lot and began building, and Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman provided regular updates on the house (see her , , and  letters to Walt Whitman). The new
      house was on a corner lot at 431 Stevens Street in Camden, New Jersey (see
      Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975], 31).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n9">7. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a
      landscape painter. Louisa sent gift boxes to her daughter regularly. For a list
      of contents in another such box, see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman. For her preparation of gift boxes,
      which Sherry Ceniza has designated "care packages" and compared to Walt's
      poetry, see <em>Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers</em>
      (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 10–12.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n15">8. The crossbar that was
      intended for the first letter "t" is written over the "ll" pair, so the word
      "telling" on a letter-by-letter basis looks more like "letting." Based on
      context, the intended word is <em>telling</em>.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n5">9. Both Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman (1833–1890) and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman
      (1836–1873) wrote in November to urge Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to visit
      St. Louis (see Jeff's November 10, 1872 letter to Louisa in Dennis Berthold and
      Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of
         Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press,
      1984], 146; and Mattie's November 15, 1872 letter in Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 88). Neither letter mentions the $25
      money order that Jeff had sent. Jeff, a civil engineer, had relocated to St.
      Louis in 1867 to serve as Superintendent of Water Works and would become a
      nationally recognized name. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00557_n13">10. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister. They lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00659_n10">11. The picture of Walt Whitman
      that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had beside her was probably G. Frank Pearsall's
      September 1872 photograph (see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image038.html">Gallery of
         Images</a>), which later served as the frontispiece for <em>Two Rivulets</em> (1876).<a href="#r11">[back]
