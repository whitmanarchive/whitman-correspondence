      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Would you be willing to entertain a proposition to cross this Autumn to England and
      deliver a course of lectures in a few of the larger cities?
   </p>
   
   <p>From facts in my possession I am quite sure that you would be very successful for
      the
      cultured class of Great Britain have an abiding interest in you and everything which
      concerns you. I should be willing to guarantee you a stated sum or if you would
      prefer it star you on a percentage. My friend and yours, R. Macaulay Stevenson<sup><a href="#n4298" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Glasgow, perhaps better known to you as "Calamus," thinks
      that your reception throughout Scotland would partake of the character of an
      ovation.
   </p>
   
   <p>Pray let me hear from you, and you believe me, with sentiments of the deepest
      respect,
   </p>

      Faithfully yours,
      <br></br>Sheridan Ford
