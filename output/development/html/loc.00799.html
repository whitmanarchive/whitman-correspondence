      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your last letter Sunday morning, though it was dated Thursday night. Mother,
      I suppose you got a letter from me Saturday last, as I sent one the day before, as
      I was concerned about Andrew—If I thought it would be any benefit to Andrew I should
      certainly leave everything else &amp; come back to Brooklyn—mother, do you recollect what
      I wrote last summer about throat diseases,<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> when Andrew was first pretty bad—well that's the whole groundwork of the business,
      any true physician would confirm it—there is no great charm about such things—as to
      any costly &amp; mysterious baths, there are no better baths than warm water, or vapor,
      (&amp; perhaps sulphur vapor,) there is nothing costly or difficult about them—one can
      have a very good sweating bath, at a pinch, by having a pan of warm water under a
      chair &amp; heating a couple of bricks or stones or any thing to put in one after another,
      &amp; sitting on the chair with a couple of blankets around him to enclose the vapor—it
      is a very wholesome sweat too, &amp; not to be sneezed at if one wishes to do what is
      salutary, &amp; thinks of the sense of a thing, &amp; not what others do—Andrew mustn't be
      discouraged, those diseases are painful &amp; tedious, but he can recover &amp; will yet—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear mother, I sent your last letter to George with a short one I wrote myself, I
      sent it yesterday—I sent a letter last Wednesday 14th to him also, hoping that if
      one don't reach him another will—hasn't Jeff seen Capt Sims or Lieut McReady<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> yet, &amp; don't they hear whether the 51st is near Nicholasville, Kentucky, yet? I send
      George papers now &amp; then—Mother, one of your letters contains part of my letter to
      the Union,<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (I wish I could have got the whole of it.) It seems to be mostly as I intended it,
      barring a few slight misprints—was my last name signed at the bottom of it? tell me
      when you write next<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Dear mother, I am real sorry &amp; mad too that the water works people have cut Jeff's
      wages down to $50<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—this is a pretty time to cut a man's wages down—the mean old punkin heads—mother,
      I can't understand it at all—tell me more the particulars—Jeff, I often wish you was
      on here, you would be better appreciated, there is big salaries paid here sometimes
      to civil engineers—Jeff, I know a fellow, E C Stedman,<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> has been here till lately, is now in Wall street, he is poor but he is in with the
      big bankers (Hallett &amp; Co) who are in with Fremont<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> in <em>his</em> line of Pacific railroad—I can get his (Stedman's) address, &amp; should you wish it
      any time I will give you a letter to him—I shouldn't wonder if the big men, with Fremont
      at head, were going to push their route, works, road, &amp;c &amp;c. in earnest, &amp; if a fellow could get a good managing
      place in it, why it might be worth while—I think after Jeff has been with the Brooklyn
      W[ater] W[orks] from the beginning, &amp; so faithful &amp; so really valuable, to put down
      to $50, the mean low-lived old shoats. I have felt as indignant about it, the meanness
      of the thing, &amp; mighty inconvenient too, $40 a month makes a big difference—Mother,
      I hope Jeff won't get &amp; keep himself in a perpetual fever, with all these things &amp;
      others &amp; botherations, both family &amp; business ones—if he does, he will just wear himself
      down before his time comes—I do hope, Jeff, you will take things equably all round,
      &amp; not brood or think too deeply—So I go giving you all good advice—
   </p>
   
   <p>O Mother, I must tell you how I get along in my new quarters, I have moved to a new
      room, 456 Sixth street, not far from Pennsylvania avenue, (the big street here,) &amp;
      not far from the Capitol—it is in 3d story, an addition back, seems to be going to
      prove a very good winter room, as it is right under the roof &amp; looks south, has low
      windows, is plenty big enough, I have gas—I think the lady will prove a good woman,
      she is old &amp; feeble, (there is a little girl of 4 or 5, I hear her sometimes calling
      <em>grandma</em>, <em>grandma</em> just exactly like Hat, it made me think of you &amp; Hat right away)—one thing is I am
      quite by myself, there is no passage up there except to my room, &amp; right off against
      my side of the house is a great old yard with grass &amp; some trees back, &amp; the sun shines
      in all day &amp;c. &amp; it smells sweet &amp; good air, good big bed, I sleep first rate—there
      is a young wench of 12 or 13, Lucy, (the niggers here are the best &amp; most amusing
      creatures you ever see)—she comes &amp; goes, gets water &amp;c., she is pretty much the only
      one I see—then I believe the front door is not locked at all at night—(in the other
      place the old thief the landlord had two front doors, with four locks &amp; bolts on one,
      &amp; three on the other—&amp; a big bull-dog in the back yard—we were well fortified I tell
      you—sometimes I had an awful time at night getting in)—I pay $10 a month, this includes
      gas, but not fuel—Jeff, you can come on &amp; see me easy now—Mother, to give you an idea
      of prices here, while I was looking for rooms, I went in to see a couple of furnished
      rooms about like our two in Wheelers houses<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> (2d story), nothing extra about them, either in location or any thing, &amp; the rent
      was $60 a month—yet quite curious vacant houses here are not so very dear, very much
      the same as in Brooklyn—dear mother, Jeff wrote in his letter<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> latter part of last week you was real unwell with a very bad cold, (&amp; that you didn't
      have enough good meals)—mother, I hope this will find you well &amp; good spirits—I think
      about you every day &amp; night—Jeff thinks you show your age more, &amp; failing like—O my
      dear mother, you must not think of failing yet—I hope we shall have some comfortable
      years yet. Mother, don't you allow things, troubles, to take hold of you—write a few
      lines whenever you can, tell me exactly <em>how</em> things are—Mother, I am first rate &amp; well, only a little of that deafness again—good
      bye for present.

      bad wounds—Mother, it is the opinion here this morning that Lee has vamosed back into lower Virginia again but there's no telling—he's a cunning old fox—he may
      make a dash at us here before we know it<sup><a href="#loc.00799_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00799_n1">1. See Whitman's letter from
      . Whitman was obviously trying
      to allay Jeff's fears, as related in the first footnote to his letter from .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n2">2. Samuel H. Sims, a captain
      in George Washington Whitman's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment, had been
      the subject in part of Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in the War,"
      which appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, on January 5,
      1863. Sims died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg, Virginia
      (see George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ). Walt Whitman may have lived in
      Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
      Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
      brother's name in the <em>New York Herald</em> listed among the
      wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
      George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
      : "I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet." On ,
      George informed Jeff that Captain Sims was in Brooklyn to recruit for the
      regiment. Evidently McReady (see the letter from ) had also gone to Brooklyn for the same purpose, since George
      referred to both in a letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on . According to a notation on the
      verso of a letter from , Whitman
      saw McReady while he was in New York in November. The Fifty-first Regiment was
      still on guard duty at Camp Nelson, Kentucky.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n3">3. See the letter from .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n4">4. Whitman, evidently, inked
      through the next three lines of this letter.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n5">5. Whitman misunderstood his
      mother's letter (now lost), and Jeff explained the situation on : "It is not like you think in
      regard to cutting down my wages. I was working for the two boards of
      Commissioners, one at $40 and the other at $50 per month, and I have got all the
      work for one board finished (the one at $40) . . . It is not the meanness or
      anything of that kind of anybody and they would pay me more if they could and
      will probably in a short time."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n6">6. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was in the Attorney General's office until he entered the
      firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The next year he opened
      his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems and was an
      indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets
         of America</em> , 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest Settlement
         to the Present Time</em> , 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n7">7. After Congress had
      endowed a Pacific Railroad, John Charles Frémont (1813–1890) was ready to
      take charge, with the assistance of Hallett. They planned to build a railroad
      from Kansas City to the West. Stedman was engaged by Hallett to edit <em>The American Circular</em>, which propagandized for the new
      railroad. Frémont was one of the <em>New York Tribune</em>'s
      candidates to succeed Lincoln in 1864. See Allan Nevins, <em>Frémont: Pathmarker of the West</em> (New York: D. Appleton-Century
      Company, 1939), 570; and Laura Stedman and George M. Gould, <em>Life and Letters of Edmund Clarence Stedman</em> (New York: Moffat, Yard
      and Co., 1910), 1:322–323.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n8">8. Whitman probably referred
      to the house his mother purchased on April 10, 1856, from John H. and George
      Wheeler, at the corner of Graham Street and Willoughby Avenue. See Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt
         Whitman</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University
      Press, 1967), 600.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00799_n9">9. On , Jeff wrote: "Mother, Mat and Sis
      are all suffering from bad colds, Mother particularly I think is failing
      rapidly."<a href="#r9">[back]
