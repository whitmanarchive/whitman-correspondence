   <p>[Whitman referred to "My Long Island Antecedents"
      and to a favorable review of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in the
      Boston <em>Herald</em>, which he included in the letter. Ostensibly by Sylvester Baxter, the review was
      partly drafted by Whitman himself.]<sup><a href="#med.00652_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

   <p id="med.00652_n1">1. The summary of the letter
      is drawn from a catalog put out by the American Art Association for a sale on
      January 31, 1939. The location of this manuscript is presently unknown. Whitman
      sent "My Long Island Antecedents" to <em>The North American
         Review</em> on October 29, but it was returned (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a discussion of the Baxter-Whitman
      co-authored review, see Kenneth M. Price and Janel Cayer, "'It might be us
      speaking instead of him!': Individuality, Collaboration, and the Networked
      Forces Contributing to 'Whitman,'" <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly
