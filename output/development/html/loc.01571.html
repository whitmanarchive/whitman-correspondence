      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you an original piece of mine, in hopes it will be found available for say
      the 
      March Number of your magazine. The price is 4 pounds—$20—in gold—and four copies of
      the number in which it is printed, sent me by mail.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please send me an answer, with decision, by next or succeeding mail.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My address is Attorney Gen's office, this city.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Morley
      (1838–1923), a statesman as well as a man of letters, was editor of the
      <em>Fortnightly Review</em> from 1867 to 1882. He had visited
      Whitman in February; see Whitman's  letter to Moncure D. Conway and Morley's <em>Recollections</em> (1917), 2:105. Morley replied on  that he could not print Walt Whitman's poem ("Thou
      vast Rondure, Swimming in Space") until April: "If that be not too late for you,
      and if you can make suitable arrangements for publication in the United States
      so as not to interfere with us in point of time, I shall be very glad."
      Unaccountably, the poem did not appear in print.
