   <p>Circumstances, Recollections, and an irresistable will I might say, induces me to
      write
      for the purpose of gratifying you and George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r2">2</a></sup> as well as
      myself. I often see your name mentioned in the various papers, and I have your address
      in my
      Memorandum Book. Well now to the point. Let us recall your <u>visit</u> previous to the battle of Fredericksburg.

   <p>The <u>Tent</u>
      <u>You</u> and <u>I</u> took the <u>rest</u> and the memories of the scenes and the effects of our
      thoughts there, and since then, the various trials, scenes pleasures, hopes, fears
      of each us <u>three</u>, <u>Walt, George, Palin</u>, and then how <u>we</u> follow on, and then on the <u>30th Sept</u> 1864,
      and then after 3 years &amp; 15 days to be in Command on that extreme left flank,
      when the order came
      through the lips
       of <u>Wright</u>. <u>Keep up a fire</u>, and then
      our retreat, <u>the last to retreat</u>, and surrender, then on to
      Richmond and on and on to Danville, then 
      Georges
      
      
      <u>absence</u>, <u>his return</u>, his few
      remarks, and then x x our exchange, return, the absence of Sam,<sup><a href="#loc.03696_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> of Butler<sup><a href="#loc.03696_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> --- <u>Lincoln</u>. Oh Walt what scenes, trials we pass through life
      yet can we not look back with somewhat of a hope that all was for the best, that we
      are blessed with light, with Fraternity, Charity &amp; Loyalty to all with Malice
      towards none, that it is a great pleasure for us, for you to hear from me, that you
      see I have a lingering appetite to let you and George know that I am still here in
      this mortal coil and that I desire a few lines from you, that we may at times
      through the great facilities of the present day correspond and now and
      
      hereafter may we hope
      to be able to see each other in that Celestial light vouchsafed to
      all mankind.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03696_n3">1. The word "Hamilton" is
      embossed at the top of the letter (perhaps as a letterhead, although it may be
      an archive stamp). Next to it is a piece of a postage stamp.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n0700">2. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03696_n1">3. Samuel Harris Smith
      (1829–1864) was a captain of the Union army and served alongside his
      brother Palin H. Sims in the 51st New York Volunteer Infantry. He was killed at
      what is now known as The Battle of the Crater in Petersburg, Virginia, on July
      30, 1864.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03696_n5">4. This is perhaps Frank
      Butler, a first lieutenant in the Fifty-First Regiment, who was killed at
      Petersburg, Virginia, in 1864.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03696_n2">5. The <em>New
         York Herald</em> ran an article by James F. Steel of South Carolina in 1880
      that read: "At the battle of the Mine, at Petersburg, 1864, I was Captain of
      Company I, Seventeenth Regiment, South Carolina Volunteers, and in this
      desperate hand to hand fight, a Captain Sims, of a New York regiment (I think
      from Brooklyn), as he mounted the breastworks immediately before my company was
      killed by Sergeant LaMott."<a href="#r5">[back]
