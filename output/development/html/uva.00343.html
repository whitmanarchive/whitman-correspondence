      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Fearful that, by insufficient examination you may not do justice to the articles from
      Mr. Leland,<sup><a href="#uva.00343_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> but give them the go-by, I write to make a <em>special request</em> that, if convenient, you print them in next S[aturday] P[ress]—the poem leading first
      col. first page, the prose following immediately after. Those articles, (I feel it
      thoroughly,) have certain little grains of salt that I wish to see put in a way of
      "leavening" the lump of ——<sup><a href="#uva.00343_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> you know what.

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Did you see what Mrs. Heenan<sup><a href="#uva.00343_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> says about me in last "Sunday Mercury"—first page?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Clapp,
      Jr.(1814–1875), was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp
      most likely met in Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan.
      Clapp, who founded the literary weekly the <em>Saturday Press</em>
      in 1858, was instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over
      twenty items on Whitman appeared in the <em>Press</em> before the
      periodical folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace
      Traubel, "You will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know
      all about me." For more about Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel,
      <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, (1906–1996), 9
      vols., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.60.html">1:214</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00343_n2">1. In the next issue of the
      <em>New-York Saturday Press</em>, on June 16, Clapp printed,
      in the columns suggested by Whitman, two contributions of Henry P. Leland, which
      had appeared earlier in the Philadelphia <em>City Item</em>: a
      poem entitled "Enfans de Soixante-Seize" and a swashbuckling tribute to "Walt
      Whitman." Leland (1828-68) was the author of <em>Grey-Bay Mare,
         and Other Humorous American Sketches</em> (Philadelphia: J.B. Lippincott and
      Co., 1856) and co-author with his brother Charles of <em>Ye Book
         of Copperheads</em> (Philadelphia: Frederick Leypoldt, 1863). Whitman spoke
      many years later to Charles of Henry's support "in the darkest years of his
      life"; see Elizabeth Robins Pennell, <em>Charles Godfrey
         Leland</em> (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1906), 2: 111, and note
      Whitman's letter from 
      .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00343_n3">2. Whitman seems to be
      reacting to the hostile <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00039.html">review</a> by Juliette H. Beach's husband which appeared in the <em>New-York Saturday Press</em> on June 2; see Gay Wilson Allen,
      <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt
         Whitman</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955), 260–261.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00343_n4">3. The <em>Sunday Mercury</em> printed an extravagant eulogy of Whitman on June 3
      which was written by the actress and poet Adah Isaacs Menken, who at the time
      was married to the prize fighter John Heenan; see Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> (New York:
      Macmillan, 1955), 262; and Allen Lesser, <em>Enchanting Rebel</em>
      (New York: The Beechhurst Press, 1947), 61–65.<a href="#r3">[back]
