   <p>I went up to your house this morning and took a look at the garden—Everything growing
      first rate—potatoes, tomatoes, corn, cabbages, and all—I guess upon the whole the
      garden never looked better at this time of year. We have had opportune rains—I inquired
      about the cow, and received a favorable report. . . .
   </p>
   
   <p>John, about coming, I am not able to say anything decisive in this letter. . . . Up
      in your Bureau all seems to go on as usual . . . John, I send you the July Atlantic.<sup><a href="#med.00316_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> . . .

   <p>I am feeling hearty and in good spirits—go around more than usual—go to such doings
      as base-ball matches and the music Performances in the Public grounds—Marine Band,
      etc. . . .
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope your parents are well—I wish you to give them my love—tho' I don't know them,
      I hope to one of these days—remember me to the wife, also.

   <p>I am writing this by my window in the office—the breeze is blowing moderate, and the
      view down the river and off along Virginia hills opposite is most delightful—the pardon
      clerks are middling busy—I have plenty of leisure, as usual—I spent yesterday afternoon
      at the Hospital, and took tea in the evening at O'Connor's.<sup><a href="#med.00316_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Burroughs
      (1837–1921) met Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864, even
      though Burroughs had frequented Pfaff's beer cellar, where he consistently
      defended Whitman's poetry, in 1862. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs. Burroughs
      was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the correspondence between the two
      men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would
      write several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1877), <em>Notes on Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (New York: American News Co.,
      1867), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1896),
      and <em>Accepting the Universe</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1920). For more information on Burroughs see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00316_n2">1. Probably Whitman sent
      this issue of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> because of Lowell's
      poem "To J. B." According to an annotation in the Harvard Library copy of the
      magazine, J. B. is John Bartlett, the compiler of quotations. One of Burroughs's
      friends, interestingly, was Joel Benton, a poet and reviewer; see Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 18. The magazine also contains an account of Ferrero's (and
      therefore George's) siege at Knoxville.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00316_n3">2. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and later
      John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge in 1860. He had been an assistant editor of the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em> before he went to Washington. O'Connor was an
      intelligent man who deserved something better than the various governmental
      clerical posts he was to hold until his death. The humdrum of clerkship,
      however, was relieved by the presence of Whitman whom he was to love and
      venerate—and defend with a single-minded fanaticism and an outpouring of
      vituperation and eulogy that have seldom been equaled, most notably in his
      pamphlet, "The Good Gray Poet." He was the first, and in many ways the most
      important, of the adulators who divided people arbitrarily into two categories:
      those who were for and those who were against Walt Whitman. The poet praised
      O'Connor in the preface to a posthumous collection of his tales: "He was a born
      sample here in the 19th century of the flower and symbol of olden time
      first-class knighthood. Thrice blessed be his memory!" (<em>Complete Prose Works</em> [New York, D. Appleton, 1910] pp. 513). For more
      on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas [1832–1889]</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00316_n4">3. John J. Piatt met Whitman
      on New Year's Day, 1863. Piatt was a versifier and author of <em>Poems by Two Friends</em> in collaboration with W. D. Howells; see Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (1931), 43. On
      February 12, 1866, he wrote a sympathetic account of Whitman and <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> for the Columbus (Ohio) <em>Morning Journal</em>; see Barrus, <em>Whitman
         and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (1931), 10, and William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (West Yarmouth,
      Massachusetts: The Stonecroft Press, 1926), 17. Burroughs quoted from Piatt's
      article in <em>Notes on Walt Whitman</em> (1867), 84–85. The
      Washington Directory of 1866 listed Piatt as a clerk in the Treasury Department;
      according to Barrus, he was later librarian of the House of Representatives and
      then consul at Cork (<em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em>
      [1931], 12).<a href="#r3">[back]
