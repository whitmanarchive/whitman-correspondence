      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Feb: 7. 1872.
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter found me today.<sup><a href="#loc.01961_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> This is my permanent address.
      I live here in a large old house wh. belonged to my father—a house on a hill among
      trees looking down upon Bristol with its docks &amp; churches—a picturesque
      labyrinth of masts &amp; spires &amp; houseroofs.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letter gave me the keenest pleasure I have felt for a long time. I had not
      exactly expected to hear from you. Yet I felt that if you liked my poem you would
      write. So I was beginning to dread that I had struck some quite wrong chord—that
      perhaps I had seemed to you to have arrogantly confounded your own fine thought
      &amp; pure feeling with the baser metal of my own nature. What you say has reassured
      me and has solaced me nearly as much as if I had seen the face &amp; touched the
      hand of you—my Master!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>For many years I have been attempting to express in verse some of the forms of what
      in a note to Democratic Vistas (as also in a blade of Calamus) you call
      "adhesiveness." I have traced passionate friendship through Greece, Rome, the
      medieval &amp; the modern world, &amp; I have now a large body of poems written but
      not published. In these I trust the spirit of the Past is faithfully set forth as
      far as my abilities allow.
   </p>
   
   <p>It was while engaged upon this work (years ago now) that I first read Leaves of
      Grass. The man who spoke to me from that Book impressed me in in every way most
      profoundly &amp; unalterably; but especially did I then learn confidently to believe
      that the Comradeship, wh. I conceived as on a par with the Sexual feeling for depth
      &amp; strength &amp; purity &amp; capability of all good, was real—not a delusion of
       distorted
      passions, a dream of the Past, a scholar's fancy—but a strong &amp; vital bond of
      man to man.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yet even then how hard I found it—brought up in English feudalism, educated at an
      aristocratic public School (Harrow) and an over refined University (Oxford)—to
      winnow from my own emotions &amp; from my conception of the ideal friend, all husks
      of affectations &amp; aberrations &amp; to be a simple human being. <em>You</em> cannot tell quite how hard this was, &amp; how you helped
      me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have pored for continuous hours over the pages of Calamus (as I used to pore over
      the pages of Plato), longing to hear you speak, <em>burning</em> for a
      revelation of your more developed meaning, panting to ask—is this  what you would
      indicate?—Are then the free men of your lands really so pure &amp; loving &amp;
      noble &amp; generous &amp; sincere? Most of all did I desire to hear from you own
      lip —or from your pen—some story of athletic friendship from wh. to learn the truth.
      Yet I dared not to address you or dreamed that the thoughts of a student could abide
      the inevitable shafts of your searching intuition.
   </p>
   
   <p>Shall I ever be permitted to question you &amp; learn from you?</p>
   
   <p>What the love of man for man has been in the Past I think I know. What it is now,
      I
      know also—alas! What you say it can &amp; shall be I dimly discern in your Poems.
      But this hardly satisfies me—so desirous am I of learning what you teach.  Some day, perhaps—in
      some form, I know not what, but in your own chosen form—you will tell me more about
      the Love of Friends! Till then I wait. Meanwhile you have told me more than anyone
      beside.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been led to write too much about myself, presuming on what you said, that you
      should like to know me better.
   </p>
   
   <p>It will give me sincere pleasure to receive a copy of your book from you. I am
      grateful to you for purposing to give me so great a gift. Will you complete the
      benefit by sending me a portrait of yourself?—
   </p>
   
   <p>It is good to hear that your work does not deny you leisure. Work with an ample
      margin of freedom is the best thing for man; but I cannot believe in the modern
      Gospel of Work &amp; no  leisure. This ends in a Science of Human Mechanics.—
   </p>
   
   <p>When I am free enough from home duties, I hope to be for America, on a tour with my
      wife. Then I shall request to be permitted to pay respect to you in person.—
   </p>
   
   <p>That you may know my face I enclose 2 portraits. The little girl in one of them is
      my
      youngest child.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds, a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was in his
      time most famous as the author of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>. But in the smaller circles of the emerging
      upper-class English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of
      homoerotic poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual
      inversion as it was then known (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 701).
