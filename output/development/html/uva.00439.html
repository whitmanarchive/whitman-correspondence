      <br></br><br></br>Dear Alma
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing is going on &amp; has gone on satisfactorily—My book is finished in
      the type setting &amp; plate-casting, &amp; if things turn out wrong any way I
      shall have only myself to blame, for I have had my own way in every thing—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Spent a few days at Concord—had the good luck to light on the most blessed time
      that Emerson has had of late years—the old man came to see me Saturday
      evening, &amp; made a long stay—Sunday he &amp; Mrs
      E gave me a dinner—every thing just as it should be, &amp; just suited
      me—I think Emerson more significant &amp; <em>glorified</em> in
      his present condition than any of his former days—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Joaquin Miller is here—I am with him every day—Longfellow has been to see
      me—I have met O W Holmes, Henry James Sr &amp;c—Should like to come on to N Y 
      abt
      
       1st of October, &amp; stay at your house a week or ten days—Write me
      &amp; say if all right—Love to John, Ally,<sup><a href="#uva.00439_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp;
      the girls &amp; babies, address me Hotel Waterston, 8 Bullfinch Place
      here—
