   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00477_n7">1. This letter dates to March
      28, 1867. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "March 28." Richard Maurice
      Bucke later assigned the year 1867, and Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with
      Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). The year is correct. This
      letter continues the concerns of two recent letters by Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, the residence with Joseph P. Davis at Pacific Street and the
      responsibilities of caring for Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's young daughters (see Louisa's  and her  letters to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n2">2. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance
      for significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the
      care of his mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was
      taken under the care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr
      Haslam Whitman, with financial support from Walt Whitman.<br><br>Manahatta
      Whitman (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother and sister-in-law. Hattie and her sister Jessie were both
      favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">5. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n6">6. Emily "Emmy" or "Emma" Price
      was the daughter of Abby and Edmund Price, who were friends of Walt Whitman and
      his mother. Emily and her sister Helen were regular visitors to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n13">7. Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Price's
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four
      children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of
      age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially her daughter Helen,
      were friends with Walt Whitman and with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860 the
      Price family began to save Walt's letters. In a  letter to Ellen M. O'Connor, Whitman declared, "<em>they are all friends</em>, to prize and love deeply."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">8. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n9">9. Charles Louis Heyde
      (1822–1892), a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–1908), Walt Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont.
      Heyde wrote to Walt Whitman in regard to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman earlier in
      March 1867: "It is reasonable to anticipate from Mrs Whitman's past robustness,
      and present approaching infirmities, that she will never undergo protracted
      sickness, but her demise, when it does take place, will occur in a brief period.
      It may so happen that Hannah may not be permitted to see her mother again."
      Heyde complained also that Hannah's lack of "outward sentiment or sympathy" had
      made it "impossible for me to respect her" (Charles L. Heyde, March 1867 letter
      to Walt Whitman, Trent Collection, Duke University). On , Walt wrote to his mother: "I have rec'd another
      epistle from Heyde—one of his regular damned fool's letters—I never
      answer them, nor make any allusion to them—it was full of
      complaints—." Heyde complained of Hannah's sloppy attire ("her appearance
      would disgrace any servant in the vicinity"), her laziness, her lack of "womanly
      sensibility . . . and intellectual imbecility" (Trent Collection, Duke
      University).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00477_n10">10. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's youngest daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband Charles L. Heyde. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. The animal that Heyde described in his letter was a small brown
      squirrel, not a rabbit as Louisa wrote here (see Charles L. Heyde's January 1867
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Duke University, Trent Collection). Louisa
      had previously noted her receipt of Heyde's January letter and his description
      of the animal she mistakenly designated a "rabbit" (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
