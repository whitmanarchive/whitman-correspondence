      card with yours of 8<u>th</u><sup><a href="#loc.07299_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> (you
      have probably seen the card lying about since you sent the letter) yet I judge from
      the tenor of what you say that your O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r3">3</a></sup> is very sick. You will
      feel bad about it I know and it is very natural you should still it is my decided
      conviction that we shall be all better off 
      went
      
       we get out of our present state than we are at present. And though I would
      gladly see O'Connor well yet (that being out of the question, I fear) the next best
      thing I think will be for him to leave us. Poor fellow! it will only be a very
      little while untill we rejoin him and we will settle then whether the whole thing
      was or was not well planned! I am glad to hear that they are looking up a chair<sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> for you.<sup><a href="#loc.07299_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> If (having a chair) you were living in a cottage with a
      lawn, trees &amp;c &amp;c. and living on the ground floor (as might all be arranged
      well enough) there is no reason why you should not spend a good part of your time
      during the summer in your chair on the grass, under the trees, among the flowers.
      You are not tied to one house (and that about the worst house and the worst situated
      that could be found for you) and there is no reason at all why you should not go
      where you would have the surroundings you need.<sup><a href="#loc.07299_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> Why not
      get Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r7">7</a></sup> to look about for a good cottage for you? I hope to
      see you before a <u>very</u> great while

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4137">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="loc.07299_n1">2. On , Whitman wrote Bucke: "The word from
      O'C is bad as you can see by the enclosed card—in some respects the worst
      yet—I am feeling badly depress'd ab't it to-day as you may think." Whitman
      might have intended to send the postal card from Ellen O'Connor dated . It is the only extant
      correspondence from Ellen before she wrote the poet of her husband's death on

      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is

   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
