   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00595_n4">1. This letter dates to June 1,
      1870. The date June 1 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1870. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
      date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The year 1870 is consistent with
      a thumb injury and infection that Walt Whitman suffered in late April or early
      May 1870, and Louisa inquired about Walt's thumb in several letters between May
      and July. The death of a butcher named Richard Hunt and the appearance of an
      article on Whitman by Anne Gilchrist are also consistent with the year.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n10">2. Walt Whitman cut his thumb
      in late April or early May 1870, and it became infected. He referred to the
      injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a second  letter to William D. O'Connor. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inquired about or expressed concern for his thumb in this and five other letters
      to Walt from May or June to July 1870: , , , , and .<a href="#r2">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n9">5. Walt Whitman sought a copy
      of an article by Anne Gilchrist (see "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman," <em>Radical</em> 7 [May 1870], 345–359). The Boston <em>Radical</em> was a Unitarian periodical edited by Sidney H.
      Morse (1833–1903). Gilchrist's "Woman's Estimate" was based on letters
      that Gilchrist wrote to William Michael Rossetti after he edited for publication
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/books/other/rossetti.html"><em>Poems by Walt Whitman</em></a> (London: Hotten,
      1868). According to Jerome M. Loving, Rossetti encouraged Gilchrist to have her
      enthusiastic letters published and forwarded them to William D. O'Connor.
      O'Connor initially contacted William C. Church and Francis P. Church, editors of
      the <em>Galaxy</em>. After they rejected Gilchrist's piece,
      O'Connor submitted it to the <em>Radical</em> (see <em>Walt Whitman's Champion</em> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
      University Press, 1978], 92–93). For more on Gilchrist, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n6">6. May 30 was designated
      Decoration Day in Washington, D.C. The holiday was not officially recognized in
      New York, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter shows that some Brooklyn
      residents engaged in unofficial observations (see "From Washington," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 30, 1870, 3). According to Drew
      Gilpin Faust, Decoration Day as a predecessor of Memorial Day was observed
      independently in Northern and Southern states, and the competing observances
      "reflect[ed] persistent sectional division" (<em>This Republic of
         Suffering</em> [New York: Vintage, 2008], 241).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n5">7. A Richard Hunt
      (1803–1870), a butcher, died in Brooklyn in May 1870 (see <em>United States Census Mortality Schedule, 1870</em>). Hunt may
      be the butcher that moved in at 1194 Atlantic Street (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n14">8. The street name is
      semi-legible. It is transcribed here as "stanton" because that street name is
      the only possible name for a street within walking distance. Portland, the
      street on which Louisa Van Velsor Whitman resided, intersected with Myrtle
      Avenue at Washington Park. Stanton Street was about seven blocks from the
      intersection of Portland and Myrtle. Duffield street was renamed Stanton in 1870
      (see <em>Brooklyn Directory</em> [1871]).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n12">9. The 1860 census lists the
      butcher Richard Hunt (1803–1870) as having 5 children. They ranged in age
      from 20 to 7 years, a decade before his reported death (see <em>United States Census, 1860.</em>, New York, New York: Ward 17, District
      1).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">10. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00595_n11">11. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman here acknowledges receipt of a money order. Walt Whitman often
      enclosed a few dollars (up to five) in each postal service letter to his
      mother, and he transmitted larger amounts by money order. Louisa reported
      using money orders from Walt to purchase a hair cloth lounge and to pay a
      debt of $10 to her grocer Amerman for a barrel of flour (see her  and her  letters to Walt). Another money
      order from Walt paid for the purchase of coal and the repair of a heating
      stove (see her  letter
      to Walt).<br><br>
