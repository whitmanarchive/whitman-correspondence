   <p>Will you afford me the pleasure of possessing your "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup>? I will remit
      you when I learn the price, of which I am ignorant at present. Professor Dowden<sup><a href="# n0199" id="r3">3</a></sup> told
      me of your having published a special ed of "L of G" &amp; showed it me. You have
      already kindly signed "R.W. Colles from Walt Whitman" in your books for me may I ask
      a like favor for "N.B." Owing to severe illness have not yet been able to deliver
      the public lecture I intended to do. My heart has been very bad for [illegible] months. I am better and hope to ful[illegible]
      promise as well as realize a [illegible]long entertained. If you will
      be good enough to forward me a photograph I shall deem it a very great favor &amp;
      will include same in remittance.
