      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been out here 9 or 10 miles from 
      Phil.
      
       City Hall all this month at a very secluded place—good quarters,
      very quiet—on a visit to an old Quaker friend—his large family are all
      away at Newport—he is absent all day down town at business—&amp; I have
      the whole premises, house, horse &amp; carriage when I want, large garden, library
      &amp;c to myself—<em>good grub</em>—with every afternoon a
      long &amp; delightful drive exploring this beautiful region for miles and miles,
      Chestnut Hill, Indian Rock, the whole Wissahickon area, &amp;c &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have 
      rec'd
      
       (June,<sup><a href="#uva.00450_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> July, &amp;c) your and Alma's
      hospitable &amp; affectionate letters, invitations—&amp; I ought to be kicked
      for not answering them before—but "you know what a wretch I am about such
      things"—never mind, <em>I appreciate them
         gratefully</em>—I am well as usual this summer—nothing very new 
      ab't
      
       my books or literary fortunes—
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall make a permanent move from Camden before many months—as my brother's
      folks are 
      ab't
      
       changing to new quarters at Burlington N J—&amp; I shall not
      accompany them—I don't know where I shall go.
   </p>
   
   <p>What a glorious summer we have had!—Never one so fine, seems to
      me—Best love to you all—Specially Alma and Albert.
   </p>
