   <p>It is not for want of thinking of you, dear Walt, that I write but seldom: for
      indeed my thoughts are chiefly occupied with you &amp; your other self—your
      Poems—&amp; with struggles to say a few words that I think want saying about
      them; that might help some to their birthright who now stand off, either
      ignorant or misapprehending.

          13.</em> I wonder if you will like a true story of Lady Dilke that I
      heard the other day—I do: It was before her marriage. She was a handsome
      young heiress, a daring horsewoman, fond of hunting. There was a man, weakly &amp;
      of good position, who had behaved very basely &amp; cruelly to a young girl in her
      neighborhood, &amp; when (as is the case in England) half the country was assembled
      on the hunting field, Lady D. faced him &amp; said in a voice that could be heard
      afar, "Sir you are a black-guard, &amp; if these gentlemen had the right
      spirit in them they would horsewhip you." He looked at her with effrontery &amp;
      made a mocking bow. "But," she continued, "since they won't, I will"—and she
      cut him across the face with her riding whip; upon which he turned and rode off
      the field, like a dog with his tail between his legs, &amp; reappeared in that
      neighbourhood no more. She was a woman much beloved—died at the birth of her
      first child (from too much chloroform having been given her). Her husband was
      heart-broken. I see you, too, are having floods. With us it pours five days
      out of seven, &amp; so in Germany &amp; France. We have made the acquaintance of
      Arabella Buckley, who has just written an interesting article about Darwin, whom she
      knew well, for the <em>Century</em>. She says his was the most
      entirely beautiful &amp; perfect nature she ever came in contact with. How I wish we
      could have a glimpse of each other, dear Friend—half an hour talk—nay, a
      good long look &amp; a hand-shake. Herby is overhead painting in his
      studio—such a pleasant room. How is John Burroughs? We owe him a letter &amp;
      thanks for a good art. on Carlyle. Love to you, dearest friend.
