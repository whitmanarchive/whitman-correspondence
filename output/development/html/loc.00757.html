   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thayer and Eldridge was
      the Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00757_n1">1. Apparently this draft
      letter was sent to Thayer &amp; Eldridge shortly after Whitman's return to
      Brooklyn. It would appear, then, that despite his reference in the letter from
      
       to his imminent
      departure, Whitman remained in Boston until May 24, and then took the new Shore
      Line Railroad to New York.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00757_n2">2. On the back of this draft
      letter Whitman wrote a series of notes about words.<a href="#r2">[back]
