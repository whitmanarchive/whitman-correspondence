   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00661_n1">1. This letter dates to June
      8, 1870. The date June 8 is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1869. Bucke's hurried year on the
      letter's surface resembles "1864," but he intended 1869. Edwin Haviland
      Miller dated a letter from Louisa to June 8, 1870, though he assigned the
      June 8 letter to both the Trent Collection (Duke) and the Library of
      Congress (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:362; 2:368). Ted Genoways
      accepted Miller's assignment of the letter to the Trent Collection (<em>Correspondence</em>, [1961–2004], 7:136). If Miller
      referred both times to the same letter but assigned it inadvertently to the
      Trent Collection in his Check List of Lost Letters (2:362), his date for
      this Feinberg Collection letter is correct.<br><br>
      Louisa inquired about Walt Whitman's injured thumb, and Walt suffered a
      serious thumb infection in spring and summer 1870. She also inquired about
      his thumb in five other letters. Louisa's letter also refers to George
      Washington Whitman's return to Brooklyn on June 3 as the previous Friday,
      and June 3 fell on Friday in 1870. George's departure for and return from
      Brooklyn on Friday are consistent with her  letter to Walt, though then she had expected George to return
      to Brooklyn on Saturday (June 4). The actions of the Brooklyn Water Board
      and Louisa's concern that George could be dismissed with Republican-leaning
      employees are consistent with the early-June 1870 actions of a Democratic
      Party subcommittee, which petitioned the Brooklyn Water Board to dismiss
      Republican employees from the Water Works. The year 1870 is therefore near
      certain.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00661_n8">2. Walt Whitman cut his thumb
      in late April or early May 1870, and it became infected. He referred to the
      injury in two letters from Brooklyn, a  letter to Walbridge A. Field and a second  letter to William D. O'Connor. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      inquired about or expressed concern for his thumb in this and five other letters
      from May or June to July 1870: , , , , and .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00661_n2">4. The Brooklyn Water Board was
      reorganized in April 1869 with four appointed commissioners, two Republicans and
      two Democrats (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). The Water Works employed a large work
      force to pave streets and install water and sewage lines. The Democrat-leaning
      Brooklyn paper had reported a recent set of layoffs and relished the prospect
      that many politically active Republicans among those removed from their position
      could be easily replaced by Democrats. The paper published an appeal by the
      "Sub-Committee of the Committee Appointed by the Democratic General Committee"
      to the Water Board for a list of Republican employees who could be replaced by
      Democrats. William A. Fowler, president of Water Board, rejected the appeal
      ("The City Hall Today," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, June 1,
      1870, 4).<a href="#r4">[back]
