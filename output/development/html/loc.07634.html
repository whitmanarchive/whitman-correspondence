   <p>I am perhaps essentially the same—<em>plus</em> the feebleness &amp; lameness &amp;
      clouded heavy almost constant half-pain feeling of head &amp; brain. Much milder
      weather here &amp; I shall try to get out in phaeton if I can—I have rec'd the
      London <em>Adv.</em> Feb. 16—Two ladies have just called
      &amp; chatted. (Mrs Talcott Williams<sup><a href="#loc.04871_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> one of them)—I enclose Ernest Rhys's<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      letter, just rec'd<sup><a href="#loc.07634_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—also two letters for you—I believe they still print
      my little bits in the personal col. NY <em>Herald</em>,<sup><a href="#n4133" id="r5">5</a></sup> but do not
      see the paper—Do you see it there? I enjoy all you say of the balm &amp;
      flowers of Florida—

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1850–1928) was a writer and frequent visitor (with her husband Talcott
      Williams) to Whitman's Camden, New Jersey, home.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4152">3. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <p id="loc.07634_n2">4. Whitman may be referring
      to the letter he received from Rhys on . In the letter, Rhys discussed his lecture in Concord at the home
      of Dr. Edward Emerson, which had been attended by Mrs. Ralph Waldo Emerson,
      Ellen Emerson, and Sanborn: "There was a general agreement with my
      position."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n4133">5. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r5">[back]
