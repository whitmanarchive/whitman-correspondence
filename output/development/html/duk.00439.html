   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00439_n14">1. This letter dates to August
      29, 1865. In this letter, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman anticipates traveling to
      Burlington, Vermont, to visit her daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde "next Monday,"
      a journey that she undertook on September 4, 1865. Her  letter to Walt Whitman reports her arrival in
      Burlington on September 4. This "tuesday evening" letter, which preceded her
      trip, thus dates to August 29, 1865, the date assigned by Richard Maurice Bucke.
      Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (<em>The
         Correspondence, 1842–67</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:377).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n5">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      did not explain to Walt Whitman the reasons that could delay her trip to
      Burlington, but her phrases "if nothing occurs" and "if nothing prevents" may
      reflect considerable tension with her son Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman. In
      his  letter, Jeff reported to Walt
      that Hannah Heyde and her husband Charles L. Heyde had quarreled about "some
      women that Heyde had in his room" and that Louisa had told Jeff that she
      intended to "bring Han home," a suggestion that Jeff ridiculed. He insisted that
      his mother's visit to Hannah be delayed until George could accompany her, but
      Jeff eventually reconciled himself to the visit (see his  letter to Walt). The relationship between Hannah
      and Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter, was difficult. Heyde
      was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n13">3. Troy is located just north
      of Albany, New York, on the Hudson River, and the journey took Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman twelve hours. Her son George Washington Whitman accompanied her by boat
      to Albany and then saw her to a car in Troy, in which she continued her journey
      to Burlington (see her  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. George
      was available to accompany Louisa on her trip because he had just begun his
      post-war housebuilding business. According to Louisa's  letter, after being mustered out of the army George
      considered journey work (day labor) and starting his own business. Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman recommended the latter but may have encouraged his own
      supervisor Moses Lane to offer George a position with the Brooklyn Water Works
      (see Jeff's  letter to Walt).
      George in July began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith
      and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
      inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. During the war, he was wounded in the
      First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the
      Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). For more information on George, see
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n10">5. When George Washington
      Whitman returned to Brooklyn after the Civil War, he rented a room from
      Elizabeth Hegeman (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt). The <em>Brooklyn
         Directory</em> (1868) lists an Elizabeth Hegeman at 83 Car[ro]ll Street,
      some three miles east of the Portland Avenue home where Louisa lived.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n7">6. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. Eddy remained in Brooklyn during Louisa's visit to
      Burlington under the care of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Jeff's wife, with
      whom Louisa and Eddy lived in the Portland Avenue home. George and his wife
      Louisa Orr Haslam cared for Eddy after Louisa's death, with financial support
      from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n9">7. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      (1833–1890), Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta "Hattie" (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868,
      Mattie and her daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see the
      introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters
         of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977),
      1–26. For more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n19">8. A man known only as Smith
      was George Washington Whitman's partner in building houses on speculation. Walt
      Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
      effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to John
      Burroughs).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n21">9. The phrase in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's hand, almost certainly "he seems," is cut away. The bottom
      quarter of the first four letters are visible, and the letters "ms" are clear.
      Richard Maurice Bucke supplied the reading "he seems" in his hand, and that is
      the most probable reading.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n15">10. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      appears to have written the letter "c" over an "s" in her spelling "Gracon."
      Juliet Grayson operated a boarding house at 468 M Street South, where Walt
      Whitman lived between late January 1865 and at least June 1866. The following
      year Walt wrote to his mother about Grayson's death after an illness (see his
       letter to Louisa).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n11">11. Jesse Whitman
      (1818–1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years before he was committed to an asylum, where he was placed in
      December 1864. Shortly after an outburst that followed his brother Andrew
      Jackson Whitman's death in December 1863—he threatened Martha Mitchell and
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's daughter Manahatta—Jeff sought to "put him in
      some hospital or place where he would be doctored" (see Jeff's  to Walt Whitman). Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse because, according to her  letter, she "could not find it in my heart to put
      him there." On December 5, 1864, Walt committed Jesse to Kings County Lunatic
      Asylum on Flatbush Avenue, where he remained until his death on March 21, 1870
      (see E. Warner's  letter to Walt).
      For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 26:1 (Summer 2008),
      35–41.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n12">12. James "Jimmy" and George
      "Georgy" Whitman were the sons of Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827–1863) and
      Nancy McClure Whitman. Nancy was pregnant with Andrew, Jr., when her husband
      Andrew died in 1863. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 13–14.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n25">13. This postscript is inverted
      in the top margin of the page. The "criticism on the press" to which Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman refers cannot be determined. No August 1865 letter from Walt
      Whitman to his mother is extant. Both the presswork in Peter Eckler's printing
      of Whitman's <em>Drum-Taps</em> (1865) and the press coverage of
      James Harlan's late-June 1865 dismissal of Whitman from the Department of the
      Interior are likely too distant to elicit this comment.<a href="#r13">[back]
