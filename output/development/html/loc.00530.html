   <p>Yours of Nov: 28 rec'd.<sup><a href="#loc.00530_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> My satisfaction with your proposed German trans[lation] increases the more you unfold
      it, and I think of it.<sup><a href="#loc.00530_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> What you say against the two texts is sound, &amp; I am content (retracting former suggestion)
      that it should be in the usual form, in German only. Want it by all means to be <em>Complete</em>. In the whole matter I freely trust to your intuitions and 'cuteness as to meanings,
      my dear friend—you have so long been a reader and lover of the book—&amp; I fully empower
      you to go on &amp; go your own way. I like of course what you say of getting the carefullest,
      technical, grammatical (and ? idiomatic) German assistance and collaboration as you
      go along.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have received a good letter from Mr Lee<sup><a href="#loc.00530_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> about the Russian translation, &amp; have written him in answer.
   </p>
   
   <p>I keep well for me, &amp; shall remain here for the winter.</p>
   
   <p>I suppose you recd a note from me weeks since acknowledging the <em>Encheiredion</em>.<sup><a href="#loc.00530_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup> My letter to Mr Lee was also as a preface to the Russian translation. Should that
      be fulfilled I will prepare &amp; send you something of the same sort for the German Volume—I
      think so much of the internationality element (sentiment) which I have intended as
      one of the leading fibres of my book—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00530_n2">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed (by Whitman): "letter sent T W H Rolleston | Dresden, Dec 22 '81." For
      Rolleston's letter of , see Horst
      Frenz, ed., <em>Whitman and Rolleston—A Correspondence</em>
      (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1951), 43–47.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00530_n3">2. On  Rolleston had proposed a German
      translation of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> "as soon as I could find a
      proper German collaborateur" (Frenz, 41). In his lost letter written on November
      9, Whitman approved the translation and proposed a double text. On  Rolleston confessed that the
      "collaborateur" was too "pedantic," and that he had reservations as to a double
      text (Frenz, 44–46). On , in reply
      to this letter, Rolleston stated his "principle of rigid literality" (Frenz,
      54). The Rolleston translation was completed years later with the assistance of
      Karl Knortz.<a href="#r2">[back]
