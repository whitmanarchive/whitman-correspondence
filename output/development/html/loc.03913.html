      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Afternoon Aug: 6
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Sitting here in the library, alone in a great big house, I thought I would write you
      a few lines to pass for a letter,—though the Lord only knows what I shall write
      about, for I have no news to tell, &amp; nothing special to say—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I came out here on a visit to an old friend<sup><a href="#loc.03913_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> a few days
      ago, &amp; shall stay here perhaps the ensuing week—The family, (&amp; a fine
      one they are) are at Newport for the summer—my friend, the father, goes to his
      business in Philadelphia absent all day, &amp; I am left here master of a large
      house garden, library &amp;c. with servants, horses,—a good dinner at 1 o'clock
      every day—have to eat it all by myself, but I enjoy it—It is a Quaker
      family I am very much attached to—(I believe I have mentioned them to you
      before)—all kind &amp; good—but the ones that seem most to me are the
      eldest daughter Mary (ab't
      
       21) the brightest happiest sunniest cutest young woman you ever saw, &amp;
      probably you would say upon knowing her, a new &amp; different combination of
      character from any you ever saw—&amp; one I am sure you would like—And
      then the father himself, my friend—he is in business in 
      Phila:—he has been a great traveler in Europe, &amp; something of a
      preacher—he is a good talker—&amp; very kind—we always have a good
      long ride, from 5 to 7½ afternoons—which I enjoy very much—&amp;
      then return to supper—&amp; a couple of hours talking, reading &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Then there is all now at Newport as I said another daughter &amp; a son,<sup><a href="#loc.03913_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> a young man—all dear friends of mine—I have
      been here quite a good deal the last year &amp; a half, when they were all
      home—but now no one but the father &amp; myself here—I wish you could
      have two or three good drives with me about here—we have a fast, strong,
      gentle young sorrel mare—first rate—the roads &amp; views are the
      finest you ever saw—&amp; now they show at their best—Yesterday (Sunday)
      afternoon &amp; evening 
      seem'd
      
       to me one of the most perfect for weather &amp;c I ever knew—we
      drove out to a hill about an hour from here &amp; had a view over twenty miles
      towards Bethlehem,—fields &amp; farms &amp; rolling country—some
      woods—the richest tract in Pennsylvania. It was an hour before sundown. It was
      like Paradise. (It will have a good effect upon me the rest of the summer.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mont was in to see me 
      ab't
      
       a week ago—By his 
      acc't
      
       you must have a house full. I hope you keep up health &amp;
      spirits—Love to Ruth—Ed also—(I 
      havn't
      
       forgot those rides evenings off among the <u>pea-pickers</u>)—Respects to Messrs. Wyld and Edwards<sup><a href="#loc.03913_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Nothing specially new with me—I am only
      middling well—seem to be getting clumsier than ever, more <u>loguey</u>—rheumatic &amp; other ailments—My loss (money, dues,
      &amp;c) I alluded to, from the letter 
      rec'd
      
       when I was down there, is worse than I expected<sup><a href="#loc.03913_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—(I knew all the spring &amp; early summer there would be <u>something</u>, for I was feeling too well &amp; prosperous
      &amp; <u>sassy</u>)—
   </p>
   
   <p>—If I could only feel well &amp; sleep well, though (which I do not) I should not
      care a straw for pecuniary botherations &amp; losses. What a beautiful ten days we
      have had past! I hope Ed's things are all turning out well. <u>So good bye for this</u>
      time, dear friend

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03913_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs Susan Stafford | Kirkwood | Glendale | New Jersey. It is postmarked:
      Philadelphia | Aug | 6 | 8 PM | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03913_n2">2. Whitman stayed with
      Robert Pearsall Smith from August 4 to 28 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03913_n3">3. Alys and Logan.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03913_n4">4. Whitman noted during his
      stay at Glendale from July 3 to 17 "the rides over to 'Charlestown' with Ed.
      evenings to engage 'pea-pickers.'" Wyld and Edwards were Mrs. Stafford's
      boarders (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03913_n5">5. What loss Whitman
      sustained at this time is not known, unless he referred to the 200 shares of
      stock he purchased on February 26 in the Sierra Grande mines at Lake Valley, New
      Mexico. According to a prospectus mounted in Whitman's Commonplace Book, shares
      in the company had a par value of $25. He received his first dividend ($50) on
      March 6, but he did not receive the second dividend, evidently payable on July
      6, when he was with the Staffords, until October 3. Perhaps the delay in payment
      made him think that he had lost his money. He may have fabricated this story
      because Mrs. Stafford wanted to borrow money. He lent her $50 on October 24,
      1882 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r5">[back]
