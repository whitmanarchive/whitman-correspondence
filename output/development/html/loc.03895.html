      <br></br><br></br>My dear friends all
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still laid up here quite sick<sup><a href="#loc.03895_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—last week has
      been about the same as the previous one with me—I am up &amp; drest, but dont
      go out—the weather is in my favor here,—if it was as hot here as it seems
      to be most of the time in Philadelphia, it would go hard with me—They are as
      kind &amp; good as can be, both Dr and Mrs Bucke—then I have a horse &amp;
      little basket-wagon appropriated to me, to go out by myself, or be driven out just
      whenever I like—but to be deprest &amp; sick prevents any thing being
      enjoyed—But enough of this—I have no doubt it will pass over, as it has
      times before—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The country here is beautiful with hay &amp; wheat—they are just now in the
      height of harvest for both, &amp; I watch them from my windows—We have rain every
      third or fourth day (just now a little too much)—Dr Bucke has a big house
      &amp; a great many visitors—from two or three to five or six here nearly all
      the time—two fine young ladies staying all the time, with Mrs B &amp; a
      governess for his younger children—I tell you if I felt well I should have
      great times—even as it is we have some jovial hours—last evening nothing
      would do but I had to come in the parlor &amp; sing a couple of verses of "Black
      Eye'd Susan"—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I get all right, the plan is three of us, Doctor &amp; another man &amp; myself
      to go down the Lakes, and all down the St Lawrence, (the "Thousand Islands" &amp;c)
      and so on far north to a great river, the Saguenay, I have always wanted to
      see—&amp; so to Quebec—will take three weeks—but I will have to
      feel very different from what I do now—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well I must close—How are you all? Is George well this summer? Is Harry well
      &amp; in the store? This is about the <u>eighth</u> or <u>ninth</u> document I have sent to you from Canada—counting
      papers, letters, postal cards, &amp;c. (one to Harry from Lake Huron) &amp; <u>I 
         havn't
         
          had a single breath of reply from any of you</u>—Susan I
      enclose you an envelope—Love to all—
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I shall get well, no doubt, &amp; be coming back like a bad penny toward the end
      of the summer.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03895_n1">1. There is no reference to
      Whitman's illness in Whitman's Commonplace Book, but in a letter to William D.
      O'Connor on , Bucke noted that Whitman "has
      not been very well for a few days" (The Trent Collection of Walt Whitman
      Manuscripts, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library). Though Whitman and O'Connor remained estranged until 1882, Bucke as
      well as John Burroughs apparently kept O'Connor informed about the poet's
      activities.<a href="#r1">[back]
