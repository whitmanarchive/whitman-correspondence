   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thanks for your good letter, which the carrier 
      bro't
      
       this morning, &amp; I was glad to get word from you all.
   </p>    
   
   
   <p>—An artist from New York, from the <u>Century</u> Magazine,
      has been here the last three forenoons, painting a big portrait of me<sup><a href="#n4961" id="r1">1</a></sup>—he has
      finished all he wants here, &amp; has just boxed it up &amp; taken it off to 
      N Y
      
       by express—he is a first rate young fellow, a good talker, &amp; has
      already travelled a good deal over the world—&amp; he made it all very
      interesting, telling me this, that, &amp; the other.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I am middling well, but very heavy &amp; nerveless—it is nearly two
      months now I have been in the house most altogether—I am bad enough—but
      I wonder I 
      a'nt
      
       worse than I am—Yes, if the weather &amp; roads are 
      any thing
      
       like fair I want to come down next Sunday &amp; shall come—my nag is
      about the same as
      ever—(lame in hind foot 
      ab't
      
       a week ago)—I keep him here in the stable yet<sup><a href="#loc.03923_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the weather has been pleasanter of late &amp; I
      get out a little occasionally to the cars or down to the ferry, but I am getting
      more &amp; more clumsy &amp; stupid.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I got a letter from Herbert 
      G.
      
      
      
      ab't
      
       three weeks ago—nothing new of any importance—they are getting
      up a little book, Life and Letters of Mrs. G.<sup><a href="#loc.03923_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   <p>—I suppose you 
      rec'd
      
       Edward Carpenter's<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r4">4</a></sup> letter to me which I enclosed to you some time ago<sup><a href="#loc.03923_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Every thing goes on as well as could be expected with my affairs &amp;c. We get along
      the same as ever here, &amp; very comfortable considering. I wish when you come up
      you would stop here—&amp; tell George<sup><a href="#n4960" id="r6">6</a></sup> so too—I wonder when he comes up
      &amp; is going around Camden he don't stop here—Tell Ed<sup><a href="#n1515" id="r7">7</a></sup> too—Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      is an old-fashion'd Jersey woman, &amp; has been to sea—&amp; as to me, you
      know what I am—

   <p>—Well I am call'd to dinner—the parrot is yelling away as I close—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4961">1. In 1886, <em>Century
         Magazine</em> commissioned American portrait painter John White Alexander to
      undertake a portrait of Whitman for inclusion in the magazine. Whitman insisted
      that the sitting be done in his Camden home, and Alexander arrived on February
      22, 1886, to begin sketches. His portrait of Whitman was not completed until
      1889 and never did appear in the <em>Century</em>. (See Ruth L.
      Bohan, <em>Looking into Walt Whitman</em> [University Park:
      Pennsylvania State University Press, 2006], 89–94.)<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.03923_n1">2. According to entries in
      his Commonplace Book, Whitman paid a Mr. Bennet $18 monthly to take care of his
      horse (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03923_n2">3. In his letter of , Gilchrist requested permission to quote
      from Whitman's letters to his mother.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">4. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

      Susan Stafford of .<a href="#r5">[back]

      Stafford's husband.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1515">7. In May 1876, Whitman met Edward
      Cattell, a young farm hand and a friend of the Staffords. The poet took an
      interest in the Cattell family: "about 25 or 6—folks mother, father
      &amp;c. live at Gloucester—his grand, or great grandfather, Jonas Cattell,
      a great runner, &amp; Revolutionary soldier, spy." Whitman referred to Jonas in
      the <em>Philadelphia Times</em> on January 26, 1879. Whitman took
      special interest, however, in Edward, as charged entries from one of his diaries
      make clear: "the hour (night, June 19, '76, Ed &amp; I.) at the front gate by
      the road." Two days later he noted "the swim of the boys, Ed. [Stafford?], Ed.
      C. &amp; Harry" (<em>Diary Notes</em> in Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection). In 1877 Whitman cited "Sept meetings Ed C by the pond at Kirkwood
      moonlight nights" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.), and in <em>Diary Notes</em> on October 29, "Ed. Cattell
      with me."<a href="#r7">[back]
