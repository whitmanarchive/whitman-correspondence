   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>Charles Aldrich
      (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
      Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
      Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
      Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man...never
      satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>).<br>David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<br></p>
