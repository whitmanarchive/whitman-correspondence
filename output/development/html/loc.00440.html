      <br></br><br></br>My dear brother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We duly received your letter<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—We of course all felt very indignant at the way you had been treated—but<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> when I came to the statement that Harlan was a parson<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> of course his conduct was to be expected &nbsp;From that class you can never get anything
      but lying and meanness—I hope you do not allow it to have any effect on you &nbsp;you must
      not—The poor mean-minded man—If Christ came to earth again and did'nt behave different from what he did when he was here he would have a mighty poor show with Harlan would'nt he—
   </p>
   
   <p>The most outrageous thing was published in the Eagle<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> &nbsp;If you have any curiosity abt. it I will send it to you &nbsp;It was perfectly in keeping with the paper and I'v no doubt was considered a very good thing by little Van<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I see by the papers that the 51st will probably be mustered out in a few days<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;How does George feel about it<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I wonder—I still think if he wishes he could get in the regular army—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother had yesterday a letter from Heyde—10 pages—of the most disgusting trash<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—the vilest and meanest things that he could get together &nbsp;He says he shall leave Han, and go out west<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—I wish he was in Hell—Mother of course is considerably exercised about it—and thinks
      she will go on there and bring Han home—thinks she will go next week &nbsp;Of course it
      is foolish for Mother to attempt any thing of the kind and I dont mean to let her go—I am in hopes that George will get home next week and then he
      could go—I am sure that Mother would never live to get there and back let alone bringing
      Han—I read Heydes letter through and it is plain to me that they have had a quarrel
      abt. some women that Heyde had in his room—they had a big row and Heyde has written to
      mother while the thing was fresh in his cussed head<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup>—I suppose mother will get another letter soon rather taking the edge of[f] of this one—I've no doubt that Han has a most outrageous existance—and that she had better leave Heyde but I certainly dont think that Mother—old as she is can think of going there—she can hardly move in the
      morning till she gets some coffee with Mat—You must write her that she had better
      not go till George comes home and he can go with her—or something of that kind—dont fail to write mother—
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything is going as usual with me—all keep about the same &nbsp;Mattie and the children
      are well &nbsp;the baby is a little down just now—but I guess she will be all right again
      in a few days—My friend Davis<sup><a href="#loc.00440_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> has got back from Peru—he spent 3 or 4 days with me last week—
   </p>
   
   <p>Write to me</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00440_n1">1. Whitman's letter of
      about July 15, 1865, is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n2">2. Whitman enclosed in
      parentheses everything after "but" to the end of the paragraph.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n3">3. James Harlan
      (1820–1899), secretary of the interior from 1865 to 1866, dismissed
      Whitman from his second-class clerkship on . Harlan apparently took offense at the copy of the 1860 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> which Whitman was revising and which he
      kept at his desk. With the help of William Douglas O'Connor and Assistant
      Attorney General J. Hubley Aston, Whitman secured a position in the attorney
      general's office. The Harlan episode led directly to O'Connor's pamphlet "The
      Good Gray Poet." Although Harlan was a Methodist, he was not a parson. Whitman
      may have sarcastically applied this term to Harlan because on May 30, 1865,
      Harlan had issued an official directive asking for the names of employees who
      disregarded "in their conduct, habits, and associations the rules of decorum
      &amp; propriety prescribed by a Christian Civilization" (Jerome Loving, <em>Walt Whitman's Champion</em> [College Station: Texas A&amp;M
      University Press, 1978], 57).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n4">4. On July 12, 1865, the
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> published "Morality in
      Washington," which noted that "Walt Whitman has lost his position in the
      Interior Department at Washington under the general order discharging immoral
      persons, his 'Leaves of Grass' being produced as evidence of his immorality....
      Walt is personally a good-hearted fellow, with some ability, but he was bitten
      with the mania of transcendentalism, which broke out in New England some years
      ago." Perhaps Jeff's outrage resulted from the charge that Whitman "wrote of
      things no right minded person is supposed ever to think of, and used language
      shocking to ears polite....He now occupies a desk in the Attorney General's
      office, where we suppose they are not so particular about morals."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n5">5. Isaac Van Anden. See
      Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt from .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n6">6. On July 25, 1865, the
      Fifty-first Regiment of New York Volunteers was discharged from military
      service.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n7">7. In her letter to Walt
      Whitman of August 8, 1865, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote: "I gess they are all
      sorry &nbsp;i dont know as they are sorry the war is over but i gess they would much
      rather staid in camp...[George] is very restless" (Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n8">8. Jeff may be thinking of
      this passage from Heyde's letter of June 1865: Hannah "will not dress herself
      decently, but in place of this when I come home to dinner...she manages to
      quarrell me out of it—so that I leave it half eaten—she begins by questioning me
      about my women [Heyde's art students],...and goes so far as to intimate that I
      have sexual intercourse with my pupils, at my room 
       This is damned mean—reckless characterless, common, and disgusting" (Trent
      Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special
      Collections Library).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n9">9. Heyde intended to
      separate from Hannah and "go West." He planned no return: "I would rather go to
      Patagonia" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00440_n10">10. Jeff is inaccurate
      here. Heyde's letter is clearly dated "June 1865," and while he may have written
      in a fit of passion he had restraint enough not to send the letter immediately.
      As Heyde himself explained: "This letter has been written for a long time. I
      have concluded to send it to you. Realy my experience robs my heart of all
      charity—Han has a plausible superficiality, but under that she is she devil, to
      men" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript,
      and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r10">[back]
