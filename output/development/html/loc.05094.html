      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday I received all your dispatches—viz, a postcard—a letter—a
      circular (with scraps)—a copy of L of G—and a set of
      proofsheets of ditto. Shall find them very useful. For all of which things, many
      thanks—I am delighted to see your new 
      edn
      
       in such grand form, and spent all yesterday reading it.<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Sometimes I missed
      regretfully a familiar rhythm and was sorry to see 'Respondez' cut up and scattered
      about the book—most of it summarily suppressed. It was, of course, rather a
      gritty poem to read straight through. Still I am very glad that I have it complete
      in my old 
      edn.<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Nearly always I have come to think your many alterations, improvements.
      This volume, with its new poems, etc. offered a field of "pleasant exploration" and
      renewed my sense of wonder and delight at your works. It is a splendid thing to have
      given them final form in this way—resumed them all in this noble volume. I
      like many of your new poems immensely, especially perhaps 'Spirit that form'd this
      scene'—a Riddle Song, and the Dalliance of the Eagles. The Riddle Song puzzled
      me—I could only think of (for the 'two words')<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> the end of a sonnet of W. B.
      Scott
   </p>
   
   
   <p><span class="indent">For we know nought of that dark sun, the True,</span><br>
      <span class="indent">Whose latent heats create our spiritual year.<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup></span><br><br><br>
      
      Yet I don't feel as if this could be it.—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very glad you like the idea of a German translation. I have had a reported
      admirer of yours, as collaborateur in my eye for some time, but I find now he is
      only a rather pedantic old savan, and that his knowledge of and admiration for you
      are both of a very limited character. However I will go on by myself at present and
      have a good mass of work ready for revision when I find the right man. The work
      shall certainly be done, and done as well as my pains and the best German help can
      do it. From attempts I have made I am convinced that a very impressive, quite
      satisfactory translation of your L of G. might be made in German. It is
      a language, which, as Germans well know, offers extraordinary facilities for
      translation especially poetic, from foreign tongues, e.g. a Greek play, which is a
      bald affair in the best English, can be put into German with all the choral metres,
      etc. accurately preserved, and lose little of its freshness and energy. Of course
      the 
      transl.
      
       would be complete—a reproduction of your new 
      vol.
      
       just as it is.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think a <em>Russian</em> translation is also probable (and certainly
      at least as desirable as the German). A friend and countryman of mine named Lee,<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      living here, is an ardent Russian scholar and intimate with many men of that nation,
      living here and in Servia, etc. They are mostly exiles, which means, speaking
      generally, men of unusual ability and thoughtfulness. I have made Lee acquainted
      with the L of G. which he appreciates, and he has just written for your
      new 
      edn. And I think (though I have not broached the subject yet) that he would be
      likely to undertake a Russian translation, and that he could get the best possible
      help for it. I shall get him to lend his book to some of his Russian friends, and
      work on this as much as I can. The book would doubtless be prohibited by Government
      but that would not hinder its spread much, rather the contrary.<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I shall have one or
      two things to ask you about with reference to the German 
      transl. Can now only think of the word 'equals' in <em>To him that
         was Crucified</em>. I take this (contrary to the general opinion as far as I
      know) <em>not</em> to imply that the little band of teachers are equal
      among themselves (there seems little significance in saying this) but rather that
      they are the equals of all other men—able to put themselves on common footing with
      all they meet, and establish free, healthy relations with them—as the
      Answerer—"the mechanics take him for a mechanic"—etc. etc. In this sense
      I should be inclined to translate the word.—Indeed though, as far as the
      translation goes, the word could be literally rendered in German and have both
      meanings open, as in English, and this of course would be the right thing to do.
   </p>
   
   <p>Are you sure about the double text of English and German? It seems to me as if it
      would give the book a formidably scientific appearance. Did anyone ever get much
      comfort out of one of those polyglot bibles with the Greek, Hebrew, Latin, English,
      
      Objibbeway
      
       etc., all arranged in parallel columns? And would people buy largely a
      book of poems of which half was in an unknown tongue? I see the advantages of the
      plan—but, at present at least, it appears to me that the disadvantages
      preponderate, especially as your works could be rendered, I think, with full
      accuracy in German—really reproducing both form and matter.—I believe
      the work would strike root <em>deeply</em> in Germany and might be of
      vast importance.
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you see that the Fortschritt<sup><a href="#loc.05094_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> ( = more or less Girondist) party have had great
      successes at the last elections here?
   </p>
   
   <p>I have ordered my book to be sent to the American papers you mentioned. I shall be
      here for a year certainly. Will always let you know my movements and about the
      translation, etc.
   </p>

      be either the 1867 edition (fourth), the 1871 edition (fifth), or the 1876
      printing, in all three of which "Respondez" appears as a complete poem under
      that title. It was printed as a complete poem in earlier editions but under
      different titles: in the second edition (1856) as "Poem of the Proposition of
      Nakedness" and in the third edition (1860) as "Chants Democratic, No. 5." In the
      1881 edition, it was broken up into several poems, some appearing under the
      title "Respondez," some under "Reversals," and some under
      "Transpositions."<a href="#r3">[back]
