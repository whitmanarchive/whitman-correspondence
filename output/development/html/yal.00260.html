      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been not well for two or three days, but am better to-day. I have had a slight
      stroke of paralysis, on my left side, and especially the leg—occurred Thursday
      night last, &amp; I have been laid up since—I am writing this 
      
      in my room 535
      15th st, as I am not able to get out at present—but the doctor gives me good
      hopes of being out and at my work in a few days—He says it is nothing but what
      I shall recover from in a few days—Mother, you must not feel uneasy—
      though I know you will—but I thought I 
      
      would write &amp; tell you the <em>exact truth</em>— <em>neither better nor
         worse</em>— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have a first rate physician, Dr. Drinkard—I have some very attentive friends,
      (&amp; if I have occasion can &amp; will telegraph to you or George—but do not
      expect to have any need)— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have had no word from St Louis or any where by letter for some days—
      
      The
      weather here is mostly stormy &amp; cold the last week—I rec'd your last
      letter with Jeff's<sup><a href="#yal.00260_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—it is ½ past one— Lizzie the servant girl has just brought
      me up some dinner, oyster stew, toast, tea, &amp;c, very good— I have eaten
      little for two days, but am to-day eating better—I wrote to Mat early last
      week— 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Later—I have been sitting up eating my dinner— </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love to you, dearest mother, &amp; to George &amp; Lou—
      <br></br>Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I will write again middle of the week— </p>
