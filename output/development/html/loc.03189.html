      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> Its a long time now since I've written to you, &amp; I owe you thanks for the
      many papers, &amp;c. you have sent me, containing verse &amp; other matter connected
      with you. I asked you the last time I wrote to let me have one small poem which
      I felt especially stirred by, in your own handwriting. I don't think I've heard
      from you since then.<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Will you remember this now, if
      it doesn't trouble you too much? I don't possess a single line of your verse in
      your own handwriting, &amp; I should think it a very <u>precious</u> possession. The
      poem I meant is that on the Arctic snowbird.<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> I send you herewith a magazine of which  I have been made Editor. The
      article signed 'H. Rowlandson' is mine. It (i.e. the Review) emanates from
      Trinity College Dublin and aims at introducing Nationalist thought among the
      upper classes in Ireland.<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> We have to go forward very
      cautiously in this enterprise, political questions here are so fiercely debated,
      &amp; at present we can only reconcile the landed interest &amp; conservative
      element by opening our columns to <u>both</u> sides alike. To get Nationalists admitted
      at all to an audience in Trinity College is a great step. We publish an article
      by Michael Davitt in September.<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> I have been getting
      acquainted with him and other prominent members of the National party here since
      I came back. The best man I have met in Ireland is John O'Leary,<sup><a href="#loc.03571_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> formerly editor of the 'Irish People', imprisoned in 1865
      for Fenianism.<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> He has been living in Paris ever since; let out after 5 years
       on
      condition of remaining abroad till his sentence (20 years) was out. This
      expired in Jan/1885 &amp; he is to the fore again now. A grand looking old man—long
      white beard, aquiline features, keen eyes—spare, sinewy frame, full of
      restrained passion and energy.
   </p>
   
   <p> What about Dr Knortz? I have heard nothing from him
      at all about that translation of the L. of G. which he should have had revised &amp;
      ready long ago. I think of writing to him about it. I fully expected it would have
      appeared before May.<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup></p>
   
   <p> We have gone into a house of our own now, at least one we have rented for
      several years, &amp; we are pretty well fixtures now. All of us well—especially
      my two little boys, who enjoy the country life very much. We have a good garden
      &amp; a little land which I work myself. On the whole, like this sort of
      life very
      much. We are about ¾ of an hour by train from Dublin, so have easy access to libraries,
      fr. there. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I hope you are well &amp; hearty. I am sorry to hear the sale of the L. of G. has
      not been so good lately. Wish we had fairly opened it in Germany. Will you send
      a line to Knortz? I was to give him 20 dollars for the work—am only
      waiting to hear that it is complete to send it, but don't like sending 
      till I know that he is going in for the thing, as I havn't yet even heard that
      he had begun it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
