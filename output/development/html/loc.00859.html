      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I find that the plates of The Leaves of Grass are now the
      property of a person named—Wentworth,<sup><a href="#loc.00859_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> whose residence
      is Warren Place, Roxbury.
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not care to know him.</p>
   
   <p>Suppose you write to him? I have no doubt you could arrange to have a new edition
      published by or through him.
   </p>
   
   <p>This is the first chance I have had to find out about it since I saw you—for I
      have only been home a week.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours Truly
      <br></br>James Redpath
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Whenever you feel like writing, I shall be glad to have a line or any number of lines
      from you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914),
      3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."
      See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins,
      1926).

   <p id="loc.00859_n2">1. Horace Wentworth was Thayer
      and Eldridge's former boss who later acted as the firm's creditor. Wentworth
      received the plates of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as compensation
      for his financial loss when Thayer and Eldridge went bankrupt in 1861.<a href="#r1">[back]
