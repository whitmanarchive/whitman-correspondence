      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of over a week ago 
      rec'd—&amp; I should have 
      answer'd
      
       before, but I expected to come down myself, or send word—but one
      thing or another delays the publication of my new book, &amp; I am waiting for
      that—it is all printed and ready, &amp; will be out early this coming
      week—I will bring you one when I come down—there is lots in about the
      pond &amp; the old lane &amp;c. and my times there five or six years ago—(but
      there are ever so many subjects in it)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I went round yesterday in the rain to make a short visit to Mrs Rogers<sup><a href="#loc.03911_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—She is pretty well,
      considering—complains of being weak in the limbs &amp; 
      flush'd
      
       with the heat, but sat in the parlor &amp; talked very cheerful &amp;
      friendly, some time—said she hoped you would come up very soon—I 
      ask'd
      
       if she 
      didnt
      
       intend going down to your house soon—she said no, she expected to go
      on east (Mass:) to see her daughter—she said Amos was to be home that Saturday
      evening, to stay over Sunday—ask'd
      
       me to come around &amp; get acquainted with him—So I had a very
      pleasant little visit—Every thing there 
      look'd
      
       about the same, nice &amp; comfortable—Jane came to the
      door—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had nothing but rain, rain, here, the last three or four days—seems to
      pour down all day long—it is well I didn't come down early in the week as I
      had intended  but now
      as I write (Sunday, late forenoon) it is very pleasant sunshiny again—as I sit
      here the bells are ringing for church, off 
      aways—sounds very good—every thing quite delightful after the long
      dark equinoctial storm—but I just wish I was down <u>there</u> this minute—a day there in the woods—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Where my books are now 
      publish'd
      
       is 23 South 9th Street, Philadelphia<sup><a href="#loc.03911_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (not far
      from Leary's book store)—and they have fixed me up a big table and arm chair,
      by a window up stairs, all to myself—&amp; there I go for an hour or two or
      three, every day if I like—the whole building is 
      stuff'd
      
       with books, some old, some very costly, some very rare—all the
      histories, dictionaries &amp;c. you can think of, &amp; everything else—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Nothing very new with me—I still keep well—eat my rations every
      time—I 
      havn't
      
       seen or heard any thing of Harry or any of you for a long
      time—except I saw Joe<sup><a href="#loc.03911_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> at the ferry over a week
      ago—I want to come down Friday next, to Kirkwood, in the usual 4 o'clock
      train—shall be down Friday<sup><a href="#loc.03911_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Love to you and
      George, Ruthy &amp; all—

   <p id="loc.03911_n2">2. On September 24 the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em> said: "It is to be regretted that
      Whitman had not the patience to wait for some firm of consequence to take up the
      task Osgood so feebly laid down," and then cited an objectionable advertisement
      of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, undoubtedly the one referred to in
      <em>The Critic</em> of October 7: "We learn from Messrs. Rees
      Welsh &amp; 
      Co.
      
      , of Philadelphia, that 'the party who inserted the advertisement' in
      which Mr. W's 'Leaves of Grass' was characterized as 'a daisy' 'has no longer
      charge of that department.'"<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03911_n4">4. Whitman went to Glendale
      on September 30, Saturday, and remained there until October 3 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See the jottings in <em>November Boughs</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1888),
      76–77.<a href="#r4">[back]
