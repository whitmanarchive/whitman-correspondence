   </p>
   
   <p>I recd your letter over two weeks ago—Am glad you have a good place at
      Marlton—such a spot is so much pleasanter than Phila. or Camden or any close
      city—Hank I am sorry you have that trouble with your throat but I have no
      doubt it will go over in time—your mother was up here yesterday—bro't me
      a nice chicken—said every thing was all right with your folks home—I am
      pretty much as usual again after quite a long siege—I am here in a little old
      house I have bought—my room is a big  one in the 2d story—get along
      well enough (nothing to brag of)—there is a couple of elderly folks,
      acquaintances of mine, Mr and Mrs Lay, they live in the house, &amp; I take my meals
      with them. Any how I like it all ever so much better than the Stevens Street
      business—Am not doing any thing lately, &amp; the sale of my books has been very slim
      for some
      time<sup><a href="#loc.04011_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Met a lady on the ferry last week, she
      came up to very pleasant &amp; said, "Your friend Jo Allen is in Laredo, Texas,
      keeping store doing well, &amp; has a family"—
   </p>
   
   <p>—<u>So long</u>, Harry dear boy—write soon, &amp; I will the
      same—I send you some papers<sup><a href="#loc.04011_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04011_n1">1. Whitman continued to sell
      books to people who wrote directly to him. According to entries in his
      Commonplace Book, he received about $30 from these sales since the first of the
      year (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). David
      McKay paid him $91.41 in royalties in June and $71.63 in December (University of
      Pennsylvania).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04011_n2">2. In his letter Harry
      evidently mentioned his impending marriage, since Whitman noted it in his
      Commonplace Book. Interestingly, the poet ignored it in his letter, as he had
      done in the past when his soldier friends reported their matrimonial plans (see
      his letters to Benton H. Wilson on ,
      and to Alfred Pratt on ). On June 25
      Harry was married to Eva Wescott by Claudius W. Bradshaw, mayor of Camden. The
      young man was accompanied by Whitman, who noted the fact in his diary and
      referred to the bridegroom's "throat trouble."<a href="#r2">[back]
