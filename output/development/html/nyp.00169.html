   <p>I once more after a long delay will endeavor to converse with you with the aid of
      pens &amp; paper. I received a answer to my first letter stating that you wer at home sick. I was very very sorry to hear of it indeed, for it appears to be very
      hard for you to be sick, after being
      amongst it so much in the Hospitals &amp; doing so much to seas [cease ?] it among the
      suffering &amp; sick Soldiers, but if it is the will of God I suppose it is for the best.
      I hope by the time this reaches you that you will be in the enjoyment of good health.
      I have got my discharge from the Hospitals about 3 weeks ago &amp; am now employed in
      the Provost Marshall office at the corner of 18th &amp; I St at the enrolling office 
      I like the place very well but I dont know how long I will stay here. The salery is $ 3.00 per day &amp; the work is very easy. We are allmost ready for the draft to come off I guess that by tomorrow Morning we will have all
      the cards wrote. there is over 2000 men to come out of the district &amp; that is going
      to fetch some of the <em>old rats out of their holes</em>. There is a great deal of swindling done here now in the way of getting in substitutes
      they get some in that a[i]nt 15 years [old.] Some of the Brokers will make a man drunk
      &amp; when he gets sober he will be a Soldier with the uniform on him. One of the detectives
      arrested a deserter belonging to the 14th Broklin Regiment that deserted at the first Battle of Bulls Run  he has bin working for Adams
      &amp; Co. Express here ever since until the detective got after him. he is now in Forrest
      Hall Georgetown. He will be assigned to some other regiment to serve the remainder
      of his time.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's . The
      following September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was
      appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until
      his retirement in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was
      prepared by Brown's family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00169_n2">1. D. Willard Bliss
      (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
      in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <em>Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America</em> (Boston, Massachusetts: John
      Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in Washington after the war; see
      Whitman's letter to Hiram Sholes from May 30, 1867 (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed.,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 1:331–332). When a pension for Whitman was proposed
      in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was quoted: "I am of opinion
      that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during the war accomplished so
      much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr. Whitman" (Thomas
      Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New York: Francis P.
      Harper, 1896], 169).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00169_n5">4. Brown possibly is referring
      to "Wm B. Douglass" whose nickname Whitman notes as "Billy" (Edward F. Grier,
      ed., <em>Notes and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–84], 2:810).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00169_n6">5. Joseph Harris was a patient
      at Armory Square Hospital. He was friends with some of Whitman's other Armory
      Square Hospital comrades, such as Lewis Brown and Adrian Bartlett. See Harris's

   <p id="nyp.00169_n7">6. Adrian Bartlett was a friend
      of Joseph Harris and Lewis Brown; all three met Whitman while they were being
      treated at Armory Square Hospital. On , Brown reported that he had not seen Bartlett and Harris since
      they returned from a spree to Baltimore on July 4, 1864. According to this
      letter, the three young men were living in a Washington boardinghouse; Harris
      was not in good health, and Bartlett worked in the Treasury Department.<a href="#r6">[back]
