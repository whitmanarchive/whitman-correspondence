      party at Rossetti's<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r3">3</a></sup> a Frenchman told him of a review of L of G.
      ab't three or four months ago in Paris—the gent. said he could give me the
      date &amp; name of magazine &amp; if so I will tell you—Your letter came last

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07539_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J.
      | Nov 1 | 8 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07539_n2">2. Whitman is referring to
      Charles Aldrich (1828–1908) (see Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.1.html">Thursday, November 1, 1888</a>). For more on Aldrich, see Ed Folsom, "The
      Mystical Ornithologist and the Iowa Tufthunter: Two Unpublished Whitman Letters
      and Some Identifications," <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em>
      1 (Summer 1983), 18–29. The "review" is probably Gabriel Sarrazin's essay
      which appeared May 1 in <em>La Nouvelle Revue</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">3. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
