      <br></br><br></br>My Dear friend Walt Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written so many letters to you dictated by Charles that I feel a painful pleasure
      in commencing this to you at
      this time—knowing that his voice is silent, &amp; that no pleasant message can
      come from his lips to you. It is useless for me to tell you how strong his
      affection was for you, &amp; how he has looked forward to you coming to 
      NH. I think after your visit to him that his hold on life
      seemed to give way and his yearnings were all accomplished. There was a
      gentleman Mr John Matthew who was very kind to him once in New
      York when he was sick he had sent several invitations to him
      but he put it off for some reason, &amp; he was the only one of all his friends.
      His exit was peaceful, no struggles, a gradual giving way. He used to say—"I
      don't believe I can die" when his sufferings were so great—it seemed as if his
      release would never come—and although I thought he was likely to die any
      time, still I find I was unprepared for his departure &amp; my ambition &amp;
      hopes are all crushed. I am feeling most keenly the desolation of widowhood. I
      look at my three children &amp; think what a work I have got
      left to perform. The duty of
      Father  &amp; Mother
      both merged in one. As far as my means go I am left very dependent—Charley's
      protracted sickness exhausting the little he had laid by. I hope I may realize a little
      from the sale of pictures. I want to
      ask you if you could at the distance I live assist me to get some writing or
      copying to do. I thought you if anyone might know of something, &amp; you could
      perhaps make inquiries—that might lead to my getting some business of that kind—I
      wish I might. Mr Townsend a dear friend of 
      Charleys
       has sent you a paper with a pleasant article written by
      himself. I hope you have 
      re<u>d</u>
      
       it. I am intending to visit New York soon
      &amp; shall try &amp; call upon your  Mother. It will be always pleasant to
      me  hear from you; any
      &amp; every association connected with my Husband will be hallowed. The funeral
      was Masonic and largely attended &amp; the ceremony at the grave was very
      impressive. My Mother from Massachusetts is with me
      for a few days and it is a great comfort.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping to hear from you soon</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mrs. Charles Hine, who visited Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman on August 22, 1871, thought it "strange" that Whitman did not reply to
      her account of her husband's death. According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      letter of , Mrs. Hine had
      received a "donation" from Walt Whitman. Whitman wrote of Charles Hine's illness
      in his  letter to William O'Connor
      and in his  letter to Peter
      Doyle.
