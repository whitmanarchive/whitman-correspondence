   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).

      Robert G. Ingersoll (1833–1899), the noted lawyer and agnostic, sent on
       what Whitman termed a "cordial,
      flattering, affectionate letter" (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<br><br>
      Whitman heard Ingersoll lecture, evidently for the first time, on May 25:
      "talked afterward with him a few minutes" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On
      May 26 the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> noted that "Walt
      Whitman . . . drank deep draughts of the orator's eloquence," and
      interpolated into its reprint of the text at several points, "['Amen' from
      Walt Whitman.]" On the following day Richard Maurice Bucke, who had
      accompanied the poet, denied that Whitman had showed either approval or
      disapproval. See also Whitman's comments on Ingersoll's religious views in
      his letter to Harry Stafford of .<a href="#r2">[back]
