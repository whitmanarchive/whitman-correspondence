      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I send you a cheering review of Hosnett's book from the <u>Nation</u>. So far I have not been able
      to find the book here, but will continue the search. It appears to give you great
      rank, and prefigures big future verdicts.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I got your letter of last May, but have not been well able to write with my half-paralyzed
      hands and moribund head. My little book overwhelmed 
      me with letters, and  I have felt stung not to be able to answer many of them, but so it is.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope the liquorice powder helped you. If not satisfactory, please let me know sometime
      when you are writing. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I had a letter from Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> recently, which I will try to answer soon. I was glad he had such a good time.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Donnelly<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r2">2</a></sup> promised to have his book out this June, but I guess the decipheration process was
      more laborious 
      than he had reckoned. My faith is not shaken.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>
      Life seems to have almost stopped still with me. I earnestly wish I could get well,
      or else
      peg out suddenly.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I hope you have stood the summer fairly well. It has been, lasting three or four days,
      pretty comfortable, and
      the worst is now, which is pretty dog dayish.
      
   </p>

      Au revoir.
      <br></br>Always faithfully

      —Will you be going 
      up to Canada this summer? Charley Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r3">3</a></sup> intends leaving here for the North on a trip Saturday, and wanted to stop to see
      you at Camden, but
      doubts whether he should find you there.
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>
      —I had a note from Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r4">4</a></sup> the other day, asking leave to print some letters of mine to Rossetti about his mother.
      He is writing 
      a memoir of her, which is nearly completed.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4108">2. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">3. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
