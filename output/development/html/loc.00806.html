   <p>. . . turn—some I have to visit every day or evening (there are husbands &amp; young lads,
      of good farmers' families &amp;c, brought up at home, never having left), while they are
      in critical state, pet them, cheer them, caress them, give them some trifle. I always
      carry a stout double-pocket haversack, filled with things—also large pockets in my
      coat &amp;c—I have articles of many kinds, I have learnt what is appropriate—I generally
      carry a bottle of wine—I buy oranges by the box, &amp; fill my pockets with them before
      going into a ward, they are very refreshing to feverish men this weather—I have nice
      preserved peaches or something of the jelly sort—to many I give little sums of money—the
      soldiers very largely come up here without one cent—every day I find cases proper
      for small gifts of money, &amp; where it is indeed more blest to give, than the good it can do them. (You hear north there quite too much of the
      rum drinking, rowdyism &amp;c. &amp; thieving of the soldiers—in general, that is confined
      to the foreign regiments, &amp; I must say to the Philadelphia &amp; N. Y. City regiments—the
      soldiers from the States, from the country, especially the West &amp; from New England
      and the country parts of N. Y. &amp; Penn, are noblest specimens of young men, well brought
      up, intelligent, singularly free from intemperance &amp;c—you ought to see them as I have
      for the last five months.)<sup><a href="#loc.00806_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup>
