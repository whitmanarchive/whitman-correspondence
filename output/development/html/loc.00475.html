      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I could not answer you before this as I have just returned from a trip down in South
      East Missouri.
   </p>
   
   <p>On 1st of July the Bd of Water Com. abolished my office and consequently it left me
      out in the cold—it was a political move and done to get me out of the way on the question
      of re-appointment—and I am sorry to say I fear it will be successful<sup><a href="#loc.00475_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>To-morrow I go to Little Rock Ark—to look into the water works question there—shall
      be gone a few days, and if I succeed shall have the job of making plans &amp;c for that
      place—this will take me a month or so—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs Archer, the lady of the school<sup><a href="#loc.00475_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> where the children are has written me saying that she thinks it would be much best
      for them to remain with her during the vacation on account 
         
      of the question of health.<sup><a href="#loc.00475_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &nbsp;I have just written her that I would like to have them visit you at Camden and spend
      also a shot visit with Mrs Gilchrist.<sup><a href="#loc.00475_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>When I returned here I found your letter and postal telling about Lou.<sup><a href="#loc.00475_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I am sincerely glad that she is getting well again &nbsp;It is sad to think of how she
      must have suffered &nbsp;My love to her and to George also. I hope ere this she has recovered
      her health again.
   </p>
   
   <p>Everything in this section is very quiet &nbsp;I have just made an arrangement about the
      right to operate some lead mines<sup><a href="#loc.00475_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> which if I can carry through will return a fortune to the party investing and will
      also be an excellent thing for me. I may likely come East this fall or latter part
      of the summer to see about getting the money to start the work. It is a most favorable
      thing and it seems to me I ought to have no difficulty in putting the matter into
      working shape &nbsp;I would like to have you drop me a line as to how Lou and all of you
      are—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00475_n1">1. From 1876 to 1877, St.
      Louis was in political turmoil. Under the new state constitution of August 1875,
      St. Louis adopted a city charter on August 22, 1876, which abolished the
      independent state Board of Water Commissioners and replaced it with a city Board
      of Public Improvements, a change similar to that made in Brooklyn in 1872 (see
      the letter from Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on ). Because of a series of legal
      challenges, the charter did not go into effect until April 1877, and the new
      Board was not appointed until August. The discredited political appointees of
      1875 were apparently striking a final vindictive blow against Jeff before they
      were replaced under the new law. Nonetheless, the city council appointed Jeff as
      water commissioner on August 21 (<em>Journal of the City
         Council</em>, 10–30 August 1877).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00475_n2">2. Mrs. Archers's Patapsco
      Seminary, located in Ellicott City, Maryland (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961-77], 3:99).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00475_n3">3. On September 21,
      Whitman reported that Hattie, who was then visiting him, suffered from "a sort
      of <em>Cholera morbus</em> &amp; fever" (<em>The
         Correspondence</em>, 3:97).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00475_n4">4. The widow Anne
      Gilchrist (1828–1886), mother of four children and author of "A Woman's
      Estimate of Walt Whitman" (1870), left her home in England in 1876 to offer
      herself, body and soul, to the man she had envisioned from reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In the poetry the Whitman persona spoke
      boldly of begetting "far more arrogant republics" ("Song of Myself"), but in
      dealing with Mrs. Gilchrist's passion Whitman was timid and evasive.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00475_n5">5. Whitman's letter of
      about July 21 is not extant. The poet undoubtedly informed Jeff that Louisa's
      baby had died before it was delivered (see the letter from Whitman to Emma Dowe
      on ).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00475_n6">6. During this period the
      lead trade was among the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the St.
      Louis economy.<a href="#r6">[back]
