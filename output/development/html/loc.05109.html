      <br></br><br></br>MY DEAREST FRIEND:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Herby went to David Bognes<sup><a href="#loc.05109_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> about a week ago: he himself was out, but H. saw
      the head man, who reported that the sale of "Leaves of Grass" was progressing
      satisfactorily. I hope you have received, or will receive, tangible proof of the
      same. Bognes is a young publisher, but, I believe from what I hear, a man to be
      relied on. His father was the publisher of my husband's first literary venture &amp;
      behaved honourably. Herby brought away for me a copy of the new edition. I like the
      type like that of '73, &amp; the pale green leaf it is folded in so to speak. I find
      a few new friends to love—perhaps I have not yet found them all out. But you
      must not expect me to take kindly to any changes in the titles or arrangement of the
      old beloved friends. I love them too dearly—every word &amp; <em>look</em> of them—for that. For instance, I want "Walt Whitman" instead
      of "Myself" at the top of the page. Also my own longing is always for a
      chronological arrangement, if change at all there is to be; for that at once makes
      biography of the best kind. What deaths, dear Friend! As for me, my heart is
      already gone over to the other side of the river, so that sometimes I feel a kind
      of
      rejoicing in the swelling of the ranks of the great company there. Darwin, with his
      splendid day's work here gently closed; Rossetti, whose brilliant genius had got
      entangled in a premature physical decay, so that <em>his</em> day's
      work was over too! In a letter to me, William, who was the best, most faithful
      &amp; loving of brothers to him, says, "I doubt whether he would ever have regained
      that energy of body &amp; concentration of mental resource which could have enabled
      him to resume work at his full &amp; wonted power. Without these faculties at ready
      command my dear Gabriel would not have been himself." Edward Carpenter's father,
      too, is gone, but he at a ripe age without disease—sank gently.
   </p>
   
   <p>The photographs I enclose are but poor suggestions—please give one to Mrs.
      Whitman with my love, or if you prefer to keep both, I will send her others. Does
      the idea ever come into your head, dear Friend, of spending a little time this
      summer or autumn in your English home at Hampstead?
   </p>
   
   <p>Herby is well and working happily. So is Grace. Little grandson &amp; his parents
      away in Worcestershire.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is indescribably lovely spring weather here just now. A carpenter near us has a
      sky-lark in a cage which sings as jubilantly as if it were mounting into the
      sky, &amp; is so tame that when he takes it out of the cage to wash its little
      claws, which are apt to get choked up with earth, in warm water, it breaks out
      singing in his hand!
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love from us all, dearest Friend. Good-bye.
      <br></br>ANNE GILCHRIST.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Affectionate greetings to your brother &amp; sister &amp; Hattie &amp;
      Jessie.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you ever see Mr. Marvin? If so, give our love, we hope to see him one day.</p>
