      <br></br>Esopus on the Hudson, 80 miles north of New York

      <br></br><br></br>Dear Hattie (&amp; all the rest)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I came up here last Thursday afternoon in the steamboat from N Y—a fine day, &amp; had a delightful journey—every thing to interest me—the constantly
      changing but ever beautiful panorama on both sides of the river all the way for nearly
      100 miles here—the magnificent north river bay part of the shores of N Y—the high straight walls of the rocky Palisades—the never-ending hills—beautiful Yonkers—the
      rapid succession of handsome villages &amp; cities—the prevailing green—the great mountain
      sides of brown &amp; blue rocks—the river itself—the innumerable elegant mansions in spots
      peeping all along through the woods &amp; shrubbery—with the sloops &amp; yachts, with their
      white sails, singly or in fleets, some near us always, some far off—&amp;c &amp;c &amp;c—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>&amp; here I am, this is now the third day having a good time—Mr Burroughs &amp; his wife
      are both kind as they can be—we have plenty of strawberries, cream &amp;c &amp; something
      I specially like, namely plenty of sugared raspberries &amp; currants—(I go out &amp; pick
      the currants myself, great red things, bushels of them going to waste)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Albert Johnston, (the Jeweler's son, I am staying with in N Y) is here too on a visit to the Burroughs's—&amp; makes it still more agreeable—</p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday we all (Mr B, Al &amp; I) went out on a long drive—I tell you it is very different
      country here from out west, or down in Jersey—the old stone fences, two feet thick—the
      scenery—the many splendid locust trees, often long rows of great big ones—the streams
      down the mountains, with waterfalls—"Black Creek"—the Cattskills, in the distance—all
      did me good. It is lucky the roads are first rate (as they are here) for it is up
      or down hill or around something continually—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We pass'd many <em>tramps</em> on the roads—one squad interested in me—it was a family of five (or six) in a small
      flat ricketty one-horse open wagon, with some poor household traps huddled together, some new baskets
      for sale (they were basket makers I suppose) &amp; some three young children—the man driving,
      the woman by his side, thin &amp; sickly, &amp; a little babe wrapt in a bundle on her lap,
      its little feet &amp; legs sticking out towards us as we went by—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>On our return at sundown a couple of hours afterwards, we met them again—they had
      hauled aside in a lonesome spot near the woods, evidently to camp for the night—the
      horse was took out &amp; was grazing peacefully near by—the man was busy at the wagon,
      with his baskets &amp; traps, &amp; the boy of 11 or so had gather'd a lot of dry wood &amp; was
      building a fire on the open ground—As we went on a little on the road we encounter'd
      the woman with the little baby still in her arms, &amp; her pretty-eyed 6 year old barefoot
      girl trotting behind, clutching her gown—the woman had two or three baskets she had
      probably been on to neighboring houses to sell—we spoke to her &amp; bought a basket—she
      didn't look up out of her old sunbonnet—her voice, &amp; every thing seem'd queer, <em>terrified</em>—then as we went on, Al stopp'd the wagon &amp; went back to the group to buy another
      basket—he caught a look of the woman's eyes &amp; talked with her a little—says she was
      young, but look'd &amp; talk'd like <em>a corpse</em>—the man was middle aged—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having a good quiet time here—eat lots of strawberries, raspberries &amp; currants—(O
      I wish Lou could have a lot of the latter to do up)—I am well—To-day for a change
      it is raining—but altogether I have enjoyed fine June weather for my trip—Will finish
      my letter in New York—
   </p>

   <p>Came away from Esopus Monday afternoon 4th, by RR, &amp; got here at dark—Still keep pretty
      well &amp; shall stay here a few days longer—I find it hard to get away—(then I take things
      quiet, &amp; a change is good for me)—Jeff's telegram came &amp; Mr Johnston tells me he telegraphed
      back Monday late in the afternoon—I should much have liked to see Jeff—I suppose he
      has gone back<sup><a href="#wwh.00013_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I suppose you women folks are having great times all to yourselves—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yesterday I went out on a steamboat sail down the bay to Sandy Hook with a party of
      Sorosis ladies—very pleasant—a real sea-sail, sea-breeze &amp;c—(I went up with the pilots
      in the pilot house)—we had dinner aboard—got back before dark—the weather keeps fine—plenty
      cool enough for me—Love to you, dear Hat, &amp; dear Jess &amp; dear Aunt Lou, &amp; every body—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="wwh.00013_n1">1. Much of the material in this
      and the letter from Whitman to Anne Gilchrist of  appeared in similar form in "A Poet's Recreation" in
      the <em>Tribune</em> on July 4, and later in <em>Specimen Days</em>. There are phrasal similarities between the letters and
      the printed versions.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="wwh.00013_n2">2. On , Jeff wrote to Whitman about an epidemic
      of yellow fever during the warm months in St. Louis and about Hattie Whitman's
      illness.<a href="#r2">[back]
