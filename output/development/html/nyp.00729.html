      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have word occasionally from you and it gives me great pleasure to know you are so
      comfortable. I get a card from Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> semi-occasionally. He
      seems to be very busy. I passed a pleasant evening with Mrs. Louise Chandler
      Moulton<sup><a href="#nyp.00729_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> the present week, and we had some considerable talk
      of you. She is an appreciative admirer of your work and prizes the chat she had with
      you last year. She writes a literary letter to the Herald each Sunday and gets in
      a
      telling touch once in a while on your work. She is a very charming and able woman.
      Your stalwart supporter. Judge Chamberlain,<sup><a href="#n3145" id="r4">4</a></sup> of the Public
      Library, I see frequently: a very thoughtful and fearlessly outspoken man. He does
      some valuable historical lecturing and often says some inspiringly good things about
      our artificiality in poetry and the drama. I wonder if it ever occurred to you that
      our novel and drama is now slowly changing base, coming round to the "realization
      of
      the real." The whole outlook to me is full of hope. I think I see in what our
      aristocratic friends are pleased to call "vulgarity in fiction and the drama" the
      sure sign of the native indigenous literature we have waited for. If I should ever
      get to see you I should take pleasure in enlarging upon this. It forms the staple
      for a number of my lectures on the literature of Democracy.
   </p>
   
   <p>Our friend Baxter<sup><a href="#n6000" id="r5">5</a></sup> had an extended notice of the Complete Works
      in the Herald. You saw it, of course.<sup><a href="#nyp.00729_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00729_n1">1. On , Whitman wrote to Richard Maurice Bucke indicating
      that he had just received a letter from Garland.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00729_n2">3. Ellen Louise Chandler
      Moulton (1835–1908) was an American poet and critic who published several
      collections of verse and prose, as well as regular contributions to the <em>New York Tribune</em> and <em>Boston
         Herald</em>. Moulton corresponded with Whitman starting in 1876 and visited him
      in Camden on April 23, 1888; she wrote of their meeting in "Three Very Famous
      People. Mrs. Cleveland, George W. Childs and Walt Whitman. Words of Washington
      and Philadelphia. Poet Who Wrote of the Birds on Paumanok's Shore," <em>Boston Sunday Herald</em>, April 29, 1888, p. 20. Though she
      had words of praise for Whitman and his work, Whitman said of her, "I can't
      endure her effusiveness: I like, respect her: but her dear this and dear that
      and dear the other thing make me shudder" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.40.html">Friday, March 1, 1889</a>). In all likelihood Garland met Moulton in his
      Boston literary circles.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n3145">4. Mellen Chamberlain
      (1821–1900) was the librarian of the Boston Public Library as well as a
      lawyer and historian.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">5. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]

      volume, remarking that this edition is "monumental in our literature." For more
