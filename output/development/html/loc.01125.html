      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose the letter I 
      recd
      
       from Dowden, which you may return to me when you
      write, I 
      rec<u>d</u>
       both your postal cards, I cant help but think if you had got away from
      Camden this summer you would have been much better, no
      matter how much of an effort it cost you to make the start. I happened to get
      Saturday Tribune &amp; saw the letter about you from the Springfield 
      Rep<u>an</u>
      . It is an admirable piece of writing (of course I see your hand) 
       &amp; contains
      some of the best things about you that have yet been in print, I am rejoiced that
      you are as well as this indicates. I do not like the title of the new book as well
      as the one you proposed last spring—namely "Songs &amp; pieces Leftover" This
      sounds like you, the other does not. We have had a very dry season here till just
      now. My berry crop &amp; other crops were much injured. I 
      rec<u>d</u>
       Dowdens 
      Shakspeare
      
       book &amp; have read several of the Chapters. For some
      reason it does not strike me. It does not very differ much from the rest of the
      critical literature of that subject, I do not yet see that it throws any new light.
      
       His Victor Hugo
      article, strikes me as much more masterly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you ever heard of this new medical idea called the "Compound oxygen Treatment"?
      by Dr. Starkey of 
      Phila.
      
      ? I would strongly urge you to try it. Our attention has been called to it
      by Mrs Johns of 
      Wash<u>n</u>
       She was threatened with some serious lung difficulty &amp; was treated by
      Starkey who was then in 
      W.
      
       He helped or Cured her lung trouble &amp; his oxygen so vivified &amp;
      re-kindled her vital energies that she got with child forthwith—after being
      married 9 years. I think I shall send my wife down there this winter: in the mean
      time I wish you would look into it. It looks as if oxygen  ought to work wonders, if it can
      be rightly taken.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I have a boat now rigged with a sail, &amp; would take you out every day if you was
      here, Rab &amp; I are getting to be pretty good old Salts. 'Sula' sends love, I hope
      you will be in the mood to write me soon.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
