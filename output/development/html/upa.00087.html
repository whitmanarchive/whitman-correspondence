   </p>
   
   <p>I am still here in the little Camden shanty not much different from when you were
      here but more disabled perhaps in locomotion power &amp; in more liability to head
      &amp; stomach troubles &amp; easiness of "catching cold" (from my compulsory staying
      in I suppose)—Mrs Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r1">1</a></sup> is still housekeeping &amp;
      cooking for me—It is just past noon &amp; I am told I am to have a good rice
      pudding made in a big earthenware baking dish for my dinner—
      wh'
      
       suits me well—(I wish you were here to help eat it)—
   </p>
   
   <p> —I see the Staffords<sup><a href="#n0852" id="r2">2</a></sup> occasionally—Mrs S[tafford]
      was here ab't a week ago, is well as usual—nothing very new or different with
      them. They are still on the old farm &amp; store &amp; expect to continue— I
      see Ed<sup><a href="#n0589" id="r3">3</a></sup> and Harry<sup><a href="#n4310" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; Joe Browning<sup><a href="#loc.03936_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> occasionally—Mrs. Rogers<sup><a href="#upa.00087_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup>, (Mrs S[tafford]'s sister) is dead &amp; buried, 
      ab't 
      
       two weeks ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>Thos: Eakins,<sup><a href="#n3166" id="r7">7</a></sup> portrait painter, has painted a picture of
      me—very different from yours—realistic—("a poor old blind despised
      &amp; dying King"<sup><a href="#upa.00087_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup>)—When you write tell me 
      ab't
      
       your pict: whether it has been on exhibition &amp;c: also 
      ab't
      
       the bust Mary Costelloe<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r9">9</a></sup> has— whether any
      thing has been done with it—Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r10">10</a></sup> is out in Indiana
      yet—Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r11">11</a></sup> was in Boston at last 
      acc'ts
      
       —I am writing little poetical bits for the N Y <u>Herald</u><sup><a href="#n4133" id="r12">12</a></sup>— Pearsall Smith<sup><a href="#n4979" id="r13">13</a></sup> and
      Mrs. S. &amp; Alice<sup><a href="#uva.00553_n3" id="r14">14</a></sup> are going to London to live— a
      big bunch of white lilies scents the room &amp; my little canary is singing gaily as
      I finish—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6113">1. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852">2. George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n0589">3. Edwin Stafford (1856–1906) was the brother of
      Harry Stafford, a close acquaintance of Whitman.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4310">4. Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford (b.
      1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked by
      early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      married to Harry Stafford's sister Deborah.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="upa.00087_n1">6. Elizabeth W. Rogers was
      buried on April 2 ((Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3166">7. Thomas Eakins (1844–1919) was
      an American painter. His relationship with Whitman was characterized by deep
      mutual respect, and he soon became a close friend of the poet. For more on
      Eakins, see Philip W. Leon, "Eakins, Thomas (1844–1916)," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00087_n2">8. Whitman is alluding here to Percy Bysshe
      Shelley's poem about King George III, "England in 1819," which begins "An old,
      mad, blind, despised, and dying King."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">9. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">10. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">11. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">12. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4979">13. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00553_n3">14. Alys Smith (1867–1951)
      was Mary's sister. She would eventually marry the philosopher Bertrand
      Russell.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">15. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
