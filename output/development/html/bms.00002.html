   <p>I find that the whole book "Specimen Days &amp; Collect"—as I sent it to
      you—338 pages (without the Appendix)—makes about as much as y'r "History
      of King Arthur" Volume<sup><a href="#bms.00002_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—If you &amp; the publisher
      prefer to pub. it all in <em>one volume</em>, you can do so.<sup><a href="#bms.00002_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Ernest Rhys | 59 Cheyne Walk | Chelsea | London England. It is postmarked:

   <p id="bms.00002_n3">3. See the letter from
      Whitman to Ernest Rhys of . Walt
      Whitman had sent the copy of <em>Specimen Days</em> on February 2
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). On  Rhys wrote: "I must not decide off-hand
      about the <em>Specimen Days</em>,—that is, whether to make
      two vols. as you suggest, or to try &amp; get the whole into one. In the latter
      case, the book would be rather crowded. . . No! I would not think of putting the
      copy of <em>Specimen Days</em> with your corrections into the
      printers' hands and will get copies from Wilson of Glasgow, carefully following
      all your deletions &amp; so on. It is one of the greatest prizes I possess,
      &amp; someday a sense of its value will inspire me, I'm afraid, to beg you to
      send me a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> too with your name in
      it, (&amp; mine, as proof of ownership,) &amp; some further inscription as
      well." On  Rhys wrote at length about a
      kind of epiphany which he had experienced at the seashore; Walt Whitman termed
      it "a wonderful letter."<a href="#r3">[back]
