      <br></br>Dear Sirs:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01568_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>By your note of 18th, from New York, just received, I find that Mr. Edmund Routledge,
      
      editor, would (I quote) like to keep &amp; use an original poem—three-page poem—sent him
      from me, but demurs to my first-asked price—that he directs you to offer me 10 pounds—which
      you can send me, $50: in gold—and that, (the terms being settled, &amp;c.) 
      he will advertise it very largely.<sup><a href="#loc.01568_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I accept the terms offered—$50 in gold—and you can forward me the am't as soon as
      convenient. 
      I repeat, that I distinctly reserve the right of printing the piece in a future edition
      of my poems.<sup><a href="#loc.01568_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sending best wishes &amp; respects to editor &amp; publishers, I remain.</p>

      next paragraph: "Allow [me] to say to Mr. E. Routledge—I profoundly
      approve your idea &amp; enterprise of a Magazine interlinking the two
      English-speaking nations, and, persevered in, I have no doubt it will be a
      triumphant success." See also Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.31.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 4:191.<a href="#r3">[back]
