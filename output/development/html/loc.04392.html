      Dear Walt,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Thank you for the two papers received today—containing many items of interest, the
      Herbert Spencer interviews included. 
      And thank you still more for the kind, constant thought which prompts you to send
      them. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Another day of midsummer warmth &amp; beauty—It seems a land of perpetual summer, &amp; I
      begin to fear that when I get 
      back to England—especially during our November fogs—I shall be dissatisfied &amp; look
      back on my Canadian 
      experiences with envy.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I think, however, that my main feeling will be gratitude that my trip was so fortunate
      in all its circumstances. And, indeed, 
      I am deeply thankful that I am so blessed.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      This morning I went with Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> through the North Bldg. (Refractory Wards.) Patients as a rule more or 
      less happy (not many melancholic) &amp; well looked after. But what thoughts, feelings,
      &amp; problems they rouse!—I asked 
      Dr. Beemer about <u>your</u> visits, &amp; though I did not learn much, what he did tell me was characteristic.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I spent the rest of the morning in looking over the papers
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      you sent, &amp; in copying some of the letters to Pete Doyle<sup><a href="#n0752" id="r3">3</a></sup> that the doctor has. These have quite a fascination 
      to me, in the side lights they throw on your most kind &amp; loving soul. God bless you
      &amp; our love to you. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      After dinner I went to the Fair along with the children &amp; Mrs. Beemer's sister. Many
      thousands of people there—from the 
      entire province I think.—The general <u>average</u> very good—fine looking people as a whole, 
      well-behaved, &amp; comfortably prosperous—English looking—but with a difference hard
      to define.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Since tea I have been across to office for a letter from our loyal &amp; indefatigable
      friend Traubel.<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> 
      Lovely glowing western sky. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      I hope that this long spell of beautiful weather will prove beneficial to you (as
      indeed it <u>must</u> do) &amp; 
      I am heartily relieved &amp; glad that the reports so far have been so favourable. Health,
      &amp; immunity from pain to you, &amp; 
      serenest joys. 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Please give my love to Mrs. Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; Warry.<sup><a href="#loc.00668_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> With best love to you always
      
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      
      Yours affectionately
      
      <br></br><u xmlns="">J.W. Wallace</u>
      
   </p>
   
   <p><u>P.S.</u> A busy week at the Asylum. Shoals of visitors to the Fair come on to see the Asylum—
      but not so many (says Dr B) as in past years.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0752">3. Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">5. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.00668_n4">6. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r6">[back]
