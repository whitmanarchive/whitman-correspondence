   <p>Yours of yesterday just rec'd—with the $25—(making 150 in all)<sup><a href="#sal.00001_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—best thanks—So you like the Brignoli bit<sup><a href="#sal.00001_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I was not sure it amounted to much, but it came
      from the heart—(it was first sent to the <em>Tribune</em> to be
      published the morning of B's funeral, but the T sent it back)—
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you all? How is Al, under the new dispensation? I send my love specially to
      Alma and the girls &amp; the new Mrs J—
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing very new with me—I am ab't as well as usual except an increasing
      lameness—Anticipate a time not remote when I shall be unable to walk at
      all—Have not forgotten the <em>Memorandum History of the
         Portrait</em>—have already outlined &amp; partly prepared it—you
      shall have it soon<sup><a href="#sal.00001_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am writing this up in my big den—the floor all around horribly <em>litter</em>-rary, but a cheery wood fire in the little
      stove—&amp; I comfortable in my great capacious rattan arm-chair—(which
      I may will to Al, if he cares for it)—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
