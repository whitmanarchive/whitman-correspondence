   <p>Forgive the rhymes!<sup><a href="#n1027" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have tried, but cannot wield your weapons. I have sent this to
      'Scribner' but I don't suppose they'll take it. I have just been reading an essay
      on
      'Walt Whitman' in Scribner,<sup><a href="#loc.04576_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> which, beautifully written
      as it is, rather reminds me of that proverbial representation of Hamlet, with the
      part of Hamlet left out. The supreme value of your works, to me, is that they have
      given me unspeakable <u>religious</u> certitude and confidence, have
      opened my eyes to the realities within and around me, and made me see in them
      something far grander and more assuring than any traditional dogmas. And this work
      I
      think no <u>poet</u> has hitherto approached, though the great
      metaphysicians have opened the path.—I rather suspect from the essay that
      Stedman is an orthodox Christian? His paragraph on the "Children of Adam" seems to
      me to show either animus or a real want of perception, for obviously the method of
      Nature which he praises so well is just that which <u>is</u>
      followed in those poems—poems for which I, for one, am unreservedly
      thankful.<sup><a href="#loc.04576_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

      bears the address: Walt Whitman | 431 Steevens Street | Camden | New Jersey |

   <p id="n1027">2. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.04576_n2">3. Edmund C. Stedman
      (1833–1908), the American poet and critic, wrote "Walt Whitman" for <em>Scribner's Monthly</em>, 21 (November 1880), 47–64.
      Stedman differs with some of Whitman's theories and objects to his
      "over-bodiness." On the other hand, he calls him a man of genius, of striking
      physical and mental qualities, excelling most writers in personal magnetism,
      tact, and adroitness as a man of the world, the avowed champion of democracy. He
      states that Whitman represents, first of all, his own personality; secondly, the
      conflict with aristocracy and formalism, and remarks that against the latter he
      early took the position of an iconoclast, avowing that the time had come in
      which to create an American art by rejection of all forms, irrespective of their
      natural basis, which had descended from the past. For the reactions of Whitman's
      friends to Stedman's article, see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931),
      192–195, and the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of . For Whitman's own response to
      Stedman's article, see "My Tribute to Four Poets" in <em>Specimen
         Days</em> and the discussion in Kenneth M. Price, <em>Whitman
         and Tradition</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990),
      79–95.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.04576_n3">4. The "Children of Adam"
      section of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, because of its treatment of
      sex, provoked much controversy. In the <em>Scribner's</em> article
      Stedman protests the "blunt and open manner" in which Whitman makes the
      "consummate processes of nature, the acts of procreation and reproduction with
      all that pertain to them" the theme or illustration of various poems, notably
      "Children of Adam." Doing so "mistakes the aim of the radical artist or
      poet."<a href="#r4">[back]
