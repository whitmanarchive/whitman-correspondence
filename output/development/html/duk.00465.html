      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>i have got in
      the habit of writing to you
      every sunday  so i thought
      i wouldent  break through
      to day) i received your letter
      yesterday<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> after looking all day
      for one i was glad to have
      the letter and glad to have the
      2 dollars at noon i hadent  one
      cent and i asked georgee<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> to
      give me 50 cents and after looking
      for a considerable time he laid
      me down 50 cents
      well Walt i felt
      so bad and child like i cried because
      he dident  give me more if i had
      got the 2 dollars a little sooner i
      should not have asked
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>i have got along very well
      up to about 2 weeks ago and since that
      time goerge  has been moody and would hardly speak only when i
      spoke to him well of course you will say mother put the worst constructions on it
      well Walt i did not the first few days i thought perhaps something had gone wrong
      in
      his business affairs but up to to day he has been so different from what he was ever
      since i have been home<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n13" id="r4">4</a></sup> but to day he is more like
      himself Well Walt i thought of every thing sometimes i would think
      maybee  he is tired of having
      me and Edd<sup><a href="#duk.00425_n13" id="r5">5</a></sup> and then i would
      think george is too noble a fellow
      for that to be the cause and i knew
      that i had not or he had not
      been to more expence  than if
      he paid his board Jeffy<sup><a href="#duk.00422_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup> told me
      to have a talk with george and
      ask him what made him so
      
      
      but i dident  like to i would ask
      him if he wasent  well and so on
      but i doo  hope it will go over
      i acted just the same as if i did
      not notice any change but i felt
      awful bad and what has
      made him act so god only knows
      but i believe it runs in the
      Whitman family to have such
      spells any how i hope they
      wont  come often) Jeff is quite
      sick to day he was sick nearly
      all night vomiting and purging
      he has eaten very heartily
      lately he eat chicken and stuffing
      for his supper and cranberry
      pie before he went to bed and
      i think that is one great cause
      of his sickness he looks bad
      but probably it will doo  him
      good to have a good clearing 
      out the rest is all well mat<sup><a href="#duk.00465_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      has had company 4 days this

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00465_n10">1. The day of the week,
      "Sunday," and "10" are in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard Maurice
      Bucke assigned the date December 10, 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's
      date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). December 10 fell on Sunday in
      1865, and December 1865 is consistent with the presence in Brooklyn of George
      Washington Whitman, Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, and Jeff's wife Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Also, the letter mentions a recent theft of a watch
      nearby, which echoes a story that appeared in the <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em> of December 6, 1865. The letter dates to December 10,
      1865.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n1">2. Walt Whitman's December 8,
      1865 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:369).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n13">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      had returned in mid-October from an extended visit to her daughter Hannah Heyde
      in Burlington, Vermont.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">5. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">7. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n12">8. The doctor is probably
      Brooklyn physician Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867), who befriended the Whitman
      family and became especially close to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his
      wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in
      his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles
      Gems" (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n.
      85).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n7">9. These two words are
      difficult to decipher. The transcription of the text, letter by letter, is
      probably "recent parknesses." The first letter in each word, however, is written
      over and the reading is doubtful. Because the letter refers to local burglaries
      and fights in the City Park near the Naval Yard, the intended phrase could be
      "recent park [me]nesses," with the "me" omitted inadvertently. The criminal
      activity that menaced the City Park near the Naval Yard followed mass layoffs of
      laborers as part of post-war demobilization (see "The Political Guillotine at
      Work, Excitement in the Navy Yard" and "The Navy Yard," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 5, 1865, 2). Louisa had described a
      crime near City Park a few weeks earlier (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n8">10. This burglary of a silver
      watch valued at $30, which occurred on Portland Avenue near Myrtle on December
      5, was reported in the next day's paper ("City News and Gossip," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, December 6, 1865, 3).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n11">11. Mrs. Jones has not been
      identified, but she may have been the neighbor whose watch was stolen.<a href="#r11">[back]
