      Am easiser than during the week, but bad enough yet—Have made away with my breakfast
      (wet Graham toast, honey &amp; tea the last three or four days)—am sitting here in the
      big chair, by window—cloudy &amp; half rainy to-day—a jolly letter f'm Ernest Rhys f'm
      Wales wh- I enclose—yr's rec'd this mng—thanks— —was formally requested (did I tell
      you?) to write an article "Tennyson at 81" for the Oct. No of the <u>N A Review</u> — by the new owners— — but have been too ill to try it, &amp; shall probably give it
      the go-by — (I don't know but I have said I w all I want to say ab't T any how)—the sun out— &amp; warm —It is ab't noon as I finish—I
      am feeling sort o' comfortable—Mrs. D and one of hte boys have gone over to Phila:
      wharf somewhere to see an old staunch ship the "Emily Reed" involved in their family
      history—Ed is here taking care—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
