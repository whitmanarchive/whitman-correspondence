   </p>
   
   
   <p>Enclosed a little piece the whole idea of which I got from you—as you see. It
      is in the <em>Critic</em> of Sept. 27<sup><a href="#nyp.00536_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Dry and warm and
      often oppressive weather here—a long spell—My lameness seems permanent
      like—I have promised to write a War Hospital Article for <em>Century</em> to supplement
      their forthcoming swell [of] war narratives by Grant &amp; the rest.<sup><a href="#nyp.00536_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>William, I wonder if you or Charles Eldridge couldn't help me to something there from
      the Medical Bureau—summaries, or statistics or any information—who do
      you know in the Surgeon Gen[eral]'s office?<sup><a href="#nyp.00536_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
