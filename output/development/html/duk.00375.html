      <br></br><br></br>Dear Uncle
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received you letter of Oct 7th &amp; here I am about to write you a reply.</p>
   
   <p>Times here have been rather busy Together with the Mass meetings &amp; a Bridial Tour that lasted a week. This was not any of my own luck but to accompany the newly
      married set was all  I was on the Company. I have received only this letter Oct 7th &amp; one writen to My Father of which both reached me the same mail. One came to me from the Regiment
      that one I answered &amp; a reply came to me. I intend to Answer all of your Kind letters.
      But this one I have neglected on account of my being a way from home so long. My letter
      to you at the time I was Poisoned has has not affected me any that time I looked the
      whole City of Washington over to find you—but I looked in vain
   </p>
   
   <p>My foot is quite well so much so that one can not tell of my being hit there. Shortly after I came to the city again to be Mounted
      on a Horse &amp; we layed in the Defences of Washington the time the Rebels came to attack the City. Then I
      went up the Shanandoah Valley untill the 24 day of August where I was Discharged. There was some very heavy fighting up
      there under Phil Sheridan<sup><a href="#duk.00375_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; perhaps he has warmed the Johnnys since then. This Charles Davis I have not heard
      from since he left for home on a Furlough<sup><a href="#duk.00375_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>. Wether he came back or not I can not tell
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Uncle you gave me one of your Photographs &amp; I shall always carry it with me in
      Remembrance of a Kind Friend &amp; one who I have thought a good deal off.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope that you will over look this neglect of mine in not writing you before this.
      This is rather bad writing any how &amp; I am a fraid you will bother yourself in reading what I have scribbled. My health is very good
      at present  Also the same I wish to you My best wishes gose with this to you
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"Little Mitch," or Reuben
      Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the war and met Whitman in
      Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with him. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24, 1864,
      he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the correspondence was
      renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On March 5, 1875,
      Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old Friend how I
      would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the days of yore.
      what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter, on August 16,
      1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for California. Eleven
      letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection at Duke University. He is also
      mentioned in Whitman's <em>Memoranda During War</em>; Richard
      Maurice Bucke, ed., <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>
      [New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134. The year is confirmed by the
      reference to Farwell's letter of March 5, 1875 (Trent Collection). (For
      Farwell's correspondence with Whitman see , , , , and .)
