   <p> The first <u>Leaves of Grass</u> was printed in 1855 in Brooklyn
      New York—small quarto 9 by 12 inches, 95 pages—in the type called
      "English"—was not stereotyped—800 copies were struck off on a hand press
      by Andrew Rome,<sup><a href="#loc.04931_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in whose job office the work was all done—the author himself
      setting some of the type.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04931_n1">1. No letter to Whitman from
      March 27, 1885, appears to be extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04931_n2">2. Andrew Rome, perhaps with
      the help of his brother Tom, printed Whitman's first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1855) in a small shop on the
      intersection of Fulton and Cranberry in Brooklyn. It was likely the first book
      the firm ever printed.<a href="#r2">[back]
