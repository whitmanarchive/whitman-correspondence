      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter, including Han's, arrived, &amp; I was glad to hear that sis's penny had a
      safe journey—I was very glad to hear George had sold one of the houses—&amp; also to hear
      from Han.<sup><a href="#duk.00645_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, all the news I have to write about my affairs, is the same old thing—we have
      had another long spell of stormy weather here, rain, &amp; snow, &amp; mud—In the office,
      every thing as usual—I spend a good deal of the time there, nights &amp; Sundays—it is
      quiet &amp; agreeable—It is likely Surratt's trial<sup><a href="#duk.00645_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> will come on before long—I have become acquainted with St Marie,<sup><a href="#duk.00645_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> the man who discovered Surratt in Rome—it was quite curious, 
      &amp; I will tell you when I come home. He goes here by a false name—he is very unhappy,
      &amp; is in dread of assassination, 
      from Surratt's friends—He came to me for advice, &amp; wanted me to intercede for him
      with some 
      members of Congress, as he says the government is treating him very coldly, as if
      they didn't consider 
      he had done them any favor. I declined to mix up at all in the matter, in any way.
      
      He talked a good deal, &amp; told me a good deal about Surratt. 
      It is quite an interesting story, &amp; I will tell you all about it when I come home.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It was so stormy, the walking so dreadful, (half-melted snow,) that I didn't go to
      the hospital last Sunday. 
      I have rec'd another epistle from Heyde—one of his regular damned fool's letters—I
      never answer them, nor make any allusion to them—it was full of complaints
      
      
      —
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day it is bright sunshiny weather—yesterday too—but rather cool—Congress is to
      adjourn this week—they have carried all their measures successfully over the President—I
      am writing this at my desk—the air is very clear, &amp; I can see a great distance over
      the 
      Potomac off into Virginia—the river is high &amp; muddy to-day—I hope this will find you
      feeling well, 
      &amp; free from rheumatism. Love to George &amp; Jeff &amp; Mat.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00645_n1">1. On March 20, 1867, Hannah
      Heyde wrote excitedly about her mother's lameness, begged her or one of the boys
      to visit her in the summer, and extolled Walt Whitman's kindness to her (The
      Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00645_n2">2. John H. Surratt, who had
      been a secret dispatch bearer for the Confederacy and involved, with his mother
      Anna, in John Wilkes Booth's conspiracy, fled the country before the murder of
      Abraham Lincoln. He remained a fugitive until he was arrested in Egypt in 1866.
      Unlike his mother, who had been convicted by a military tribunal and ordered
      hanged on July 7, 1865, the son was tried in a civil court, between June 10 and
      August 10, 1867. Walt Whitman described the trial in his  letter to Alfred Pratt. When the jury could not agree,
      a new trial was ordered, but because of inadequate evidence the government
      quietly released Surratt on June 22, 1868. His sister Anna sought clemency for
      her mother in 1865, but, presumably because of a conspiracy, her plea never
      reached the desk of President Andrew Johnson. See David Miller DeWitt, <em>The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</em> (New York: The
      MacMillan Company, 1909).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00645_n3">3. Henry Ste. Marie reported
      the hiding place of John H. Surratt to the American consul in Montreal when
      Surratt fled there shortly before Lincoln's murder; see DeWitt, <em>The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</em> (New York: The
      MacMillan Company, 1909), 187–188, 205–206.<a href="#r3">[back]
