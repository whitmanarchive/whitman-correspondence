      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We have made another move, and are now stoping about 6 miles from Culpepper Court House, and near where the late fight took place
      between Banks &amp; Jackson.<sup><a href="#duk.00324_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We left Frederickburg about 8 Oclock in the evening of August 12th and marched until
      4 Oclock next morning when we stoped and had 3 or 4 hours sleep, and started on again. we marched about 38 miles altogether
      but as we had a baggage train of about 30 wagons we could not get along very fast.
      when we arived here the fight was over and old Stonewall had skedadled back in the mountains, pretty
      badly licked too, as near as I can find out.<sup><a href="#duk.00324_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> This is as handsome a country as I ever saw, &nbsp;we find plenty of forage in the shape of Beef, Chickens, eggs, potatoes, and the way the cattle
      and sheep have suffered since we have been here is a caution to secesh farmers, &nbsp;some of our boys go to a house where there is a sheep dog, take the dog
      and make him catch as many sheep as they want, and bring them in and cook them, and
      you may be sure the yankees get some tall cussing from the farmers. The weather here
      is splendid, &nbsp;the days are no hotter than in Brooklyn and the last three or four nights
      have been plenty cool enough, &nbsp;We brought no tents with us and I am so used to sleeping
      out on the ground that I don't know as I could sleep in a house at all. I can sleep
      out in the rain and not get the least cold or feel any worse for it, so Mother you
      must know that I am pretty toughf and hearty &nbsp;There is a large number of Troops about here and we shall probaly move on in the course
      of a day or two &nbsp;the troops all seem to be in the best of health &amp; spirits.
   </p>
   
   <p>The 14th are somewhere about here but we change about so often its hard work to keep
      track of any one.<sup><a href="#duk.00324_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is quite a long while since I have heard from any of you, but I expect letters
      for us to have to go a long way before they find us. I sent you 40$<sup><a href="#duk.00324_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> by Express which I supose you received. I write this sitting on the ground, under a thundering great big oak
      tree that shades about an acre of ground. Mother I think after the war is over we
      will buy our little farm down here at the foot of these mountains, and retire from
      active service.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is now about time for dress parade so I must knock off and get ready &nbsp;I dont believe I shall have a chance to write you very often as there will be no way of
      getting to the post office but I will write as often as there is a chance to send
      letters which may be oftener than I supose as I know nothing about where we shall go
   </p>
   
   <p>Direct my letters to Cullpepper Court House</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00324_n100">1. In the first part of this
      letter, Whitman speaks of the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Virginia (sometimes
      called the Battle of Cedar Run). &nbsp;On August 9, 1862, Jackson, with superior
      numbers, struck the forces of General Banks, inflicting heavy Union
      casualties.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00324_n2">2. Nathaniel Prentiss Banks
      (1816–1894) and Thomas Jonathan "Stonewall" Jackson
      (1824–1863).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00324_n3">3. This statement is more
      than likely an attempt by George to raise the spirits of his mother, who was
      evidently becoming discouraged over the progress of the war (see George
      Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman from ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00324_n4">4. The Fourteenth New York
      State Militia was officially designated (December 7, 1861) as the Eighty-Fourth
      Regiment of Infantry from New York.<a href="#r4">[back]
