   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01700_n1">1. Burroughs wrote to Walt
      Whitman from London on ,
      after he had visited St. Paul's, where he had a staggering revelation, not
      unlike Henry James's in a Parisian gallery: "I saw for the first time what power
      &amp; imagination could be put in form &amp; design—I felt for a moment
      what great genius was in this field.…I had to leave there &amp; sit
      down.…My brain is too sensitive. I am not strong enough to confront these
      things all at once…It is like the grandest organ music put into form."
      Whitman wrote in the margin: "Splendid off hand letter from John
      Burroughs—? publish it." On ,
      William Michael Rossetti referred to a visit three days earlier from Burroughs:
      "I like his frank manly aspect &amp; tone." Burroughs visited Dowden in November
      1871; see <em>Fragments from Old Letters, E. D. to E. D. W.,
         1869–1892</em> (1914), 16–17.<a href="#r1">[back]

      In his letter of , Dowden
      cited a number of Dublin admirers, and concluded: "One thing strikes me
      about everyone who cares for what you write—while your attraction is
      most absolute, &amp; the impression you make as powerful as that of any
      teacher or vates, you do not rob the mind of its independence, or divert it
      from its true direction. You make no slaves, however many lovers."<br><br>
