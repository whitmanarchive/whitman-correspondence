      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been in these last months as a 
      haunted
      
       deer and still at present I have in many days not an only
      leisure–hour, and all this business is not in your American money–making
      way, though of the most cumbrous and toilsome sort.
   </p>
   
   <p>"Democratic Vistas" have they before <u>not</u> appeared in danish
      translation. The translation  into Danish of your prose is a <u><u>very</u></u> difficult task, and I
      dare not confide it to any other than myself. But in the next half year the
      translation shall appear.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received 
      to
      
       or three american papers from you;— of course you have duly received
      from me a little selection of norwegian poetry in English translation. If my article
      on you should appear in any american magazine, I should like to have [
      <span class="unclear">sent?</span>]
       a copy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"North
      american
      
       Review" [
      <span class="unclear">Fin?</span>]
       has had an
      article on Bj Bjornson by Hjalmar Hjorth
      Boyesen.
      I wonder that Clemens Petersen who is an infinitely greater talent
      has got no entrance into this periodical.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How is it with poor Clausen? I long to hear news from him and
      from yourself.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the
      letter from Schmidt to Whitman of ).
