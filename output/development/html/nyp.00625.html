   <p>Your last letter, dear Walt, that of 31<u>st</u> of January,<sup><a href="#nyp.00625_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is very cheering, it has quite set me up, and really I
      do not see why you should not go on for quite a while and have a middling good time
      especially when the pleasant weather comes. I feel more and more that you <u>must</u> get out in the spring and that the new leaves &amp;
      flowers will be your best medicine. Ed Carpenter's<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r2">2</a></sup> piece is
      <u>good</u>,<sup><a href="#nyp.00625_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have written him a
      line. I have still only looked into Sarrazin's<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r4">4</a></sup> piece. Am fairly
      stuck fast for <u>time</u> to do anything since the fire. I will
      gladly make an abstract of Sarrazin's piece but want to see Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r5">5</a></sup> and if that is sufficient there is no need of me doing it over
      again—we shall see.<sup><a href="#nyp.00625_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> It seems as if the fire and
      matters arrising out of it will keep Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r7">7</a></sup> and self back still
      another week. [W]e have set now 18<u>th</u> inst. for our trip
      East. I trust it will not be delayed beyond that date. I am more than ever enxious
      to get on with the meter now as Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r8">8</a></sup> is out of a job and I
      want the meter to furnish him one [—] I have every confidence that it will do
      so. [—] We have glorious sleighing here now and I am enjoying it greatly, I
      get out every day about 4.30 till 6. and sometimes (in the way of business) get
      other drives. Today is charming [.] I should like to be out the whole of it! but I
      am on duty—no clergiman this morning so I had to preach! I am supposed to know
      every thing and do every thing and I just put a good face on it and get through the
      best I can.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0141b">2. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="nyp.00625_n2">3. Carpenter's review of
      <em>November Boughs</em> appeared in the <em>Scotch Art Review</em>, 1 (April 1889), 334–35.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n3115">4. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n3039">5. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00625_n3">6. Whitman had asked both
      Kennedy and Bucke to make an abstract in English of Sarrazin's "Poétes
      moderns de l'amérique, Walt Whitman," <em>La Nouvelle
         Revue</em>, 52 (May 1888), 164–84 (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of
      , and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
      an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re Walt
         Whitman</em> (1893, pp. 159–194). The letter is discussed in Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.16.html">Tuesday, February 5, 1889</a>, and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.20.html">Saturday, February 9, 1889</a>.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4284">7. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="n4267">8. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
