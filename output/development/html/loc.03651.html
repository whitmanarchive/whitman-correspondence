   </p>
   
   
   <p>I presume you will be a little surprised when you open this letter—and will cast your
      eyes down at the end of it before you read it to see the writers <u>name</u>, but I received a letter from your Mother telling me of your very severe illness
      in wich you have our Heartfelt sympathy (Barth, my Husband, and myself) your Mother asked
      me to write to you &amp; write about any thing she says will interest you
   </p>
   
   <p>Now Cousin I hardly know what to write—there are many things of interest I could write
      about—But to write to one who has so much knowledge and intellect I am afraid you
      will think [illegible] but a very poor hand at it—and the trouble with cousin Sarah she writes her letters
      so plainly—you must excuse my simple way of writing you (now there is something that
      interests <u>me</u> <u>just</u> <u>now</u> and I will tell
      
      
      
      you all about––it is to take place this month to of my [illegible] one to be memorized one your Mother knowing Mr Olivers' daughter of Brooklyn from
      your old neighborhood the other lives at Binghampton Dr. Griffen's daughter you may
      have heard of him he had charge of one of the hospital at [illegible] drawing the men two model wifes that can <u>grace</u> <u>the</u> <u>parlor</u> or <u>grace</u> <u>the</u> kitchen (if need be) this is the kind of <u>wife</u> <u>men</u> in my opinion ought to look for not a doll to be looked at, I hope <u>cousin</u> if you live to get well you will look about and get such a one for a <u>wife</u> because you will meet just such a one in your old days I do not mean to say you are
      an old man bye any means because I do not know how old you are (now do not suppose for a moment
      that I am a match maker (&amp; no I am not) but I do feel sorry for old [
      <span class="unclear">Bachelors?</span>]
      ) me think I see you lay this <u>scribbles</u> down with a remark: [
      <span class="unclear">?</span>]
       cousin Sarah must think I have a great deal of time to master
      
      it in reading this paper. But I have taken your Mother advice—I said I did not know
      what to write—her reply was any thing would charm you. Now I am fraid I have gone
      too far—but you must make all due allowance for me <u>must</u> you. I could have written a mans' sympathetic letter (But then my heart is so full
      of my own sad Afflictions) But nevertheless you have our sympathy
   </p>
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">John has?</span>]
       just called my attention to a paragraph in the evening [
      <span class="unclear">express?</span>]
      , in wich it speaks of your improved health I can assure you we are glad to hear that if is
      so now cousin Walter if you feel that you have time to answer this scribbleing I should think it a favor (can you read it I doubt if you can) you do not know perhaps
      I am left handed so you will please make all due allowances John wishes to be remembered
      to you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sarah Avery was another one of Walt Whitman's
      cousins. On May 20, 1873, she suggested with trepidation and apologies—she was
      so overawed by Walt Whitman's "knowledge and intellect"— that he should find a
      good wife for his old age (The Library of Congress). Her husband John, a New
      York merchant, wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman twice in 1872 about interest
      due her from the estate of Elizabeth Maybee (The Library of Congress).
