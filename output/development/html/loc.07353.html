   <p>Your card of 2nd<sup><a href="#loc.07353_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came to hand yesterday morning.
      Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> was here and I showed it to him. He left by 11.30
      a.m. train for the west. I took him to the station and saw him off. He could only
      stay with me from Wednesday evening to Saturday morning—a short visit but I
      was glad to have him—would have been more glad if he could have stayed longer.
      We had some good talks and altogether a real good time. I wish you could get the
      little "annex" out at once—I want much to see it but suppose it cannot be
      issued untill Lippencott gets the poems printed that he has.<sup><a href="#loc.07353_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>It is sunny, warm (not hot) and pleasant here. The place tooks well and all is going
      quietly and well with us.

   <p>My brother Eustace<sup><a href="#loc.07351_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> (who you will remember)—we call
      him Duke—arrived here at noon today from Ottawa we have spent a few pleasant
      hours together this afternoon

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

      (b. 1831). His occupation is unknown, but according to Seaborn's Genealogy of
      the Bucke family (MS) Philip Eustace "Left home when 16 . . . crossed ocean 92
      times . . . Retired at 55—spent rest of time in making rods &amp;
