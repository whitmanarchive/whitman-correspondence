      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I<sup><a href="#n0196" id="r1">1</a></sup> have now received a series of papers &amp; post cards, yet
      have never once ventured to reply, &amp; I am in [
      <span class="unclear">sort?</span>]
       afraid you will deem me growing cold in
      my sympathy for you with my long silence. It is not so and I hope it never will be:
      I have been waiting all this time in the hopes that I might have a cheery letter to
      write you of how all goes on here in your <u>matters</u>, but I
      learn from Rosetti<sup><a href="#n0520" id="r2">2</a></sup> that he is keeping you well up with news up to date, so that on
      that score I find I have no  news to write you that you 
      wont
      
       already know. so far I learn all goes on pretty well with the kind aid of
      all our English folk that care and love you they seem all to be doing their best to
      get subscribers to your <u>noble testimonial to</u> your <u>
         countries
         
          100 years</u> To me it seems a fitting and truly beautiful offering,
      and <u>one</u> that I hope to see your people yet—warmly
      and tenderly appreciate at its worth. one item I deem they will never forget, I mean
      your noble services to the gallant souls who fought and eved died for the Union of
      their Land—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>The reading of their memorandums made me almost weep and faint I saw you in the midst
      of them. [
      <span class="unclear">Aye?</span>]
       mentally I
      was near you. I heard you speak to them: I saw them look on you, grasp your hand,
      embrace you, Kiss you: the eyes of them I saw that glistened upon you. Oh man, how
      I
      wished while I read I was near you, to tell you how I felt for you, how I loved you,
      and even begrudged the love and sympathy you realized from these <u>
         Hero's
         
         </u>. I fain would have been you. I feel like Ruskin when I read such
      actions of <u>love</u>, that I fain would be the actor oh brave
      kind generous soul
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>in them memories of thine, why need thou care for us poor puny souls. men nursed in
      luxery's lap one may say: men who know [
      <span class="unclear">scant?</span>]
       anything 
      then
      
       one's petty duties from day to day, even [
      <span class="unclear">several?</span>]
       of them shirked too? While thou has
      been a father, mother, nurse, doctor, priest, and who can tell all, to thousands.
      Well. Well, let them rail thou and thy <u>work</u>, will live in
      the hearts of these men, and in the memories of them who are in the other region:
      fear not the storm will pass by—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>P.S.</p>
   
   <p>I cannot close this note without stating that I have now placed copies of your Poems
      in all our towns' libraries, in Shields, Manchester, Newcastle, Warrington,
      Birkenhead, Liverpool, [
      <span class="unclear">London?</span>]
      , Plymouth, Morpeth, Tynemouth.. and other places in all I find
      I have circulated some 80 copies of [
      <span class="unclear">including?</span>]
       the English one, and American ones. so you see the
      little hand's been a working one.

   <p id="n0520">2. William Michael Rossetti edited a British edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, called <em>Poems by
         Walt Whitman</em>, that John Camden Hotten published in 1868. About half of
      the poems from the 1867 American edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> had to be removed for the British edition. In his twenty-seven
      page "Prefatory Notice," Rossetti justified his editorial decisions, which
      included editing potentially objectionable content and removing entire poems:
      "My choice has proceeded upon two simple rules: first, to omit entirely every
      poem which could with any tolerable fairness be deemed offensive to the feelings
      of morals or propriety in this peculiarly nervous age; and, second, to include
      every remaining poem which appeared to me of conspicuous beauty or interest."
