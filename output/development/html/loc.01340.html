   <p>Your letters have been rec'd<sup><a href="#loc.01340_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup>  &amp; Alys's<sup><a href="#loc.04268_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>  also—&amp; have given me
      comfort—So full of living buoyancy &amp; youth—I see <u>those qualities</u>—or the tally of them—are the
      important matter, &amp; then the circumstances &amp; happenings may be whatever may
      chance—The son [—] a friend of mine [—] of the proprietor of the paper here asked
      me
      to "help him out" in yesterday's paper<sup><a href="#loc.01340_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—so I gave
      him the letter to print—I enclose you the slip—how well &amp; off-hand
      it reads —I
      am living here in my den in Mickle Street the same as ever—A little
      episode—the 9-month-old baby grandson of Mrs. Lay (my housekeeper) was
      attacked with cholera infantum &amp; brain trouble a week ago—the doctor
      insisted on a change of <u>locale</u>—they lived in hot
      close rooms—so the babe &amp; mother &amp; two other children are here the
      past week—&amp; the babe (an exceptionally fine one), is out of
      danger—but it has been a close shave—the doctor comes twice a
      day—says it has been <u>this</u> <u>house</u> &amp; back yard, (very nice &amp;
      breezy—we have had a hammock swung there), that has done most of the
      curing—Are you interested in the episode? I have been much.<sup><a href="#loc.01340_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.01340_n3">1. These letters appear to be
      lost.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04268_n3">2. Alys Pearsall Smith
      (1867–1951) was a social activist and the wife of philosopher Bertrand
      Russell. Smith was the daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, a Quaker religious
      leader, evangelist, map publisher, and friend of Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01340_n1">3. Probably Harry Bonsall,
      the son of the owner of the Camden <em>Daily Post</em>. No article
      by Whitman, though, could be located in the newspaper.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.01340_n2">4. The baby, Harry Lay, died
      on August 7 and was buried three days later (Whitman's Commonplace Book). During
      June and July Whitman was having his new "shanty" repaired. Peter Doyle called
      on June 4, Edward Carpenter was in Camden from June 18 to 20, and Whitman's
      brother Jeff and his two daughters arrived on June 20 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r4">[back]
