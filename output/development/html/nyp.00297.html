   <p>I have received your kind note, dear, dear friend—I shall be with you all again next
      Sunday evening without fail, soon after 7.<sup><a href="#nyp.00297_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>

   <p>Nelly, I have procured from New York one of the Brady Photos,<sup><a href="#nyp.00297_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (the one with the hand up, which you liked) and am having it framed, to present to
      you. Understand that, like the new year's Bible, the Photo is a gift, with my best
      love, to you &amp; William—to pass on to dear Jeannie.
