      <br></br><br></br>Dear Harry
      
   </p>
   
   <p>At the request of your mother &amp; from what you wrote some time ago I bundled up
      all the old letters I could find, &amp; Edward Stafford<sup><a href="#nyp.00534_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      stopt here &amp; took them to her—this is over a week ago, (Ed still comes up
      here to school in Phila. to learn bookkeeping)—I believe your folks are all as
      usual—but I suppose you have heard from there, latest particulars. I am
      jogging along pretty much the same as ever—was to the theatre last week, &amp;
      enjoyed it, "Francesca da Rimini"—lots of love-making &amp; hugging in the
      play, done first rate—I quite fell in love with the lady actress (Mary
      Wainwright)<sup><a href="#nyp.00534_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the actors spied me in front,
      &amp; sent around to ask me to come behind the scenes, which I did at the end of the
      play, &amp; was made much of, especially by Barrett the star—was invited to go
      with him to the Continental to supper—which I declined<sup><a href="#nyp.00534_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p> I am doing a little in writing—have a little poem in Harpers for March,
      forthcoming, which I will send you<sup><a href="#nyp.00534_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—(I sent you the
      Indian piece,<sup><a href="#nyp.00534_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I believe)—When you get ready to go
      on further, or to any Western city, or anywhere, I will furnish you with a general
      letter of recommendation, if you wish it—may serve to break the ice, possibly,
      somewhere. I suppose you get the Camden &amp; other papers I send—
   </p>
   
   <p> For over a month now we have had rough winter weather here—lately rain &amp;
      fog, most a week—but to-day is bright &amp; fine—I am sitting up in the
      3d story room, Stevens street, in the afternoon sun writing this—Glad you
      write to me in such good spirits, &amp; are well—<em>they two
         are every thing</em>—Keep on—explore the big western cities,
      Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis—Denver—even to California—it will do
      you good to see the actual world, &amp; men &amp; affairs—God bless you, dear
      boy—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00534_n1">1. The year is confirmed by
      the notes below. February 10 fell on Sunday in 1884. Stafford was still in
      Canada with Richard Maurice Bucke (see the letter from Whitman to Harry Stafford
      of ). On  he informed the poet that he was suffering from an
      "abcess in my neck," and asked for a letter of introduction to any one Whitman
      knew in Detroit: "Don't get the blues worth a dam and don't aspect
      to."

   <p id="nyp.00534_n2">2. Possibly Edward L.
      Stafford, son of Richard C. Stafford, or perhaps Whitman meant Edmund D.
      Stafford (see the letter from Whitman to Harry Stafford of ).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00534_n4">4. Whitman noted this
      performance in his Commonplace Book on January 30: "B[arrett] sent for me behind
      the stage &amp; I went at the close of the play &amp; had a short interview with
      him in his dressing room. Acting good, especially Francesca's and her lover's"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Lawrence Barrett (1838–1891), an
      American actor, was noted for his Shakespearean roles.<a href="#r4">[back]
