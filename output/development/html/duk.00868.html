   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George C. Cox
      (1851–1903) was a well-known celebrity photographer who had taken
      Whitman's picture two months prior, when the poet was in New York for a
      lecture.

   <p id="duk.00868_n2">2. George Cox proposed
      selling signed copies of his photographs of Walt Whitman. However, when the
      September 1887 issue of <em>Century</em> appeared with an
      advertisement, Whitman still had not seen proofs, much less signed the
      photographs. He wrote John H. Johnston on , "He advertises...to sell my photo, with autograph. The latter is
      forged, &amp; the former illegal &amp; unauthorized." The disagreement was
      quickly resolved, and Walt Whitman signed photographs for Cox and returned them
