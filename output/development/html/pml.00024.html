      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your first letter of about a month ago, (March 9)—I enquired of a
      friend in the revenue office, about the tax under the new law, &amp; whether ruffles
      would be exempted, &amp;c.<sup><a href="#pml.00024_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; on or about the 11th March, I wrote you, what I had
      learned—viz: that they were to be exempted—&amp; also all the gossip
      &amp; news, about the O'Connors, &amp; about myself, literary matters with me, and
      how I was situated here, and about things in general—<em>of
         course</em> a mighty interesting letter it must have been—and a dreadful
      loss not to get! for I infer by your second letter April 7, just rec'd, that you did
      <em>not</em> get it—which I deeply regret, for I don't like
      to be supposed capable of not responding to those that are almost the same as <em>my own folks</em>—(I put both the old &amp; new No's on the
      address—perhaps that made it miscarry,) but let that go—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The changes in the Attorney Gen's office have made no difference in my
      situation—I have had the good luck to be treated with "distinguished
      consideration" by all the Attorney Gen's—Mr. Speed,<sup><a href="#pml.00024_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Mr. Stanbery, &amp; the present
      one Mr. Browning—I couldn't wish to have better bosses—&amp; as to the
      pleasantness &amp; permanency of my situation here, it is not likely to be affected,
      as far as at present appears, unless Wade,<sup><a href="#pml.00024_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> coming in power, should
      appoint Harlan,<sup><a href="#pml.00024_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> or some
      pious &amp; modest Radical of similar stripe, to the Attorney Generalship—in
      which case, doubtless, I should have to tumble out.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My dear friends, I often think about you all—Helen &amp; Emily in particular,
      &amp; wish I could look in upon you, Sunday afternoons—I warmly thank you for
      your hospitable offers—Give my best respects to Mr. Arnold &amp; Mr.
      Price—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall have a piece in the Galaxy for May—it will be called
      "Personalism"—is a continuation of the piece on Democracy—shall have a
      poem soon, (perhaps in May No.) in the Broadway magazine<sup><a href="#pml.00024_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well as usual—the Impeachment is growing shaky<sup><a href="#pml.00024_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—it it a doubtful business—I am writing this at my
      table in office—as I look out it is dark &amp; cloudy with a chill rain, but
      the grass is green &amp; I see the river flowing beyond. With love,
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I saw William &amp; Ellen O'Connor last night—told them I should write you
      to-day—Both charged me to send you their love—little Jenny is well
      &amp; active. I send you a newspaper same mail with this.
