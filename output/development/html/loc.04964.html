      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have to thank you for the copy of the "<u>Philadelphia
         Enquirer</u>" of the 12<u>th</u> inst, which I received this
      morning. I was very pleased to read the paragraph marked, and still more pleased by
      the kind remembrance + consideration which prompted you to send it.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I wish that, besides the
      information it gives as to what you are doing, it had also said how you were. By its
      account of your "buoyant spirits," and of your "getting outdoors in good weather"
      it
      indirectly conveys a good impression of yoru health, but I am anxious to hear a more
      authentic account. I earnestly hope that you are much better than when you wrote
      last. D<u>r</u> Johnston<sup><a href="#n4102" id="r1">1</a></sup> received a long + most
      kind + interesting letter yesterday from J. A. Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r2">2</a></sup> which he
      sent on to me to read. He intended to forward a copy to you by this mail, + I have
      no doubt but that he will do so.
   </p>
   
   <p>Symonds's letter is so kind, + so pathetic in its interest, that I am inclined to
      write to him myself;—and, if a favourable opportunity presents itself, I will
      do so.
      <u>Your</u> name will be a sufficient warrant for my intruding
      upon his Alpine solitude and 7 months winter—in "broken health" + "meditations
      upon the problem of approaching death" (referred to in the Preface to his last
      Essays)—with a note of friendliness + sympathy—with no little of
      reverence and gratitude too. God bless him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We have had a very seasonable Christmas here.—snow on the ground with slight
      frost, rather dull + overcast, with heavy snowfall in the evening.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>We had a slight thaw for a day or two previously, but it seems likely to revert to
      frost again. Last week end—while the keen frost continued + the trees were
      hung with rime—we had two of the most lovely moonlight nights here I ever remember to have
      seen. The country about Rivington—near here was beautiful beyond description.
      I only wish that I had the time + the power to give you some account of it. But <u>one</u> element in a description of its effect upon me as I
      walked through it would lie in the influences your books have had on me to make me receptive to its
      marvellous + mystic beauty. Thanks to you.—and love to you—now and
      always.
   </p>
   
   <p>When you get this we shall have entered upon a new year. I hope that it may bring
      you
      renewed health and strength + blessedness + joy. All good be with you, + the
      increasing love of an
      increasing number of those who are entering upon the blessed fruits of the long
      [
      <span class="unclear">travail?</span>]
       of your
      soul.
   </p>
   
   <p>With love + best wishes</p>

   <p id="n0615">2. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
