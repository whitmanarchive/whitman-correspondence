   <p>After a long day [illegible] this morning the
      blessed rain begins. It is falling soft and steady as I write here at my desk in my
      office and from time to time look up and out at the windows to realise &amp; enjoy
      it. How good it is after heat and dust! how lovely and soothing!

   <p>Well, I have your good letter of 14th enclosing Rhys'<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and
      M. J. Cummings (whoever he (or she?) may be—(melancholy [
      <span class="unclear">events?</span>]
      ) the [illegible] seems to have had a bad time.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes, I got the "Woodberry Piece" all right. These foolish, would be visions, he's
      &amp; hars will one day
      come to an end—in the mean time I do not know but they do more good than
      harm—keep things stived up (Mr Goethe's Faust God says the Devil is a good
      servant of his—that he (Satan) keeps man stived up while without such prodding
      man would go, and stay, asleep).— Real glad to hear that you are likely soon
      to write the O'C<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> preface.

   <p>D<u>r</u>
      [

       (I am sorry to
      say) has never turned up in these parts—perhaps he may yet—hope
      so—want to see him.

   <p>Mr &amp; Mrs [
      <span class="unclear">Mysan?</span>]
       are
      still here—they will go I believe tomorrow—we all like them well and
      have enjoyed their visit with us.
   </p>
   
   <p>The meter is jogging along slowly—we are getting the shop fitted up—there
      is a lot to do yet before we have a business established—but we still have
      confidence and we shall put the thing right though

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
