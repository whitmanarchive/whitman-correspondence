      Wilkins<sup><a href="#loc.07535_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> (tell me more ab't him—is he a
      Canadian?) should understand that it is not a soft or profitable job, &amp; some
      features not very nice either—I have tho't of
      dispensing any caretaker, but I believe I get no nearer to even the <em>middling-get-along-condition-of-myself</em> before this
      spell—with a sort of prospect (if I live at all) of getting in a more immobile
      situation than ever—(am indeed in a pretty bad way now)—But you &amp;
      Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> manage it, &amp; I shall be docile—If E W is indeed the proper one

   <p>I am sitting in my big chair by the oak wood fire as I write—it is a darkish,

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07535_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr. R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Oct 26 | 8 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07535_n2">2. On , Bucke reported that he was
      sending Edward Wilkins as a replacement for Musgrove: "He is a real good, nice
      looking, young fellow. I have known him some years—he is as good as he
      looks" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.104.html">Friday, October 26, 1888</a>). Wilkins (1865–1936) arrived in
      Camden on November 5, 1888 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). He stayed for a year, then returned to Canada to attend the
      Ontario Veterinary College in Toronto. After graduation in 1893 he moved to
      Alexandria, Indiana, where he married and spent the rest of his life. For this
      biographical information I am indebted to Bert A. Thompson, Director of
      Libraries at Kearney State College, Nebraska.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.00799_n6">4. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was in the Attorney General's office until he entered the
      firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The next year he opened
      his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems and was an
      indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets
         of America</em> , 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest Settlement
         to the Present Time</em> , 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">5. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07535_n3">6. On  Stedman wrote: "In many respects
      this collection (so strikingly and fittingly got up) is one of the most
      significant—as it is the most various—of your enduring works"
      (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.104.html">Friday, October 26, 1888</a>.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07535_n4">7. The notice appeared on
      the editorial page on October 23, 1888. For Whitman's taste, "there's too much
      of the battered old veteran business" (Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.104.html">Friday, October 26, 1888</a>).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02128_n1">8. Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0316">9. William Dean Howells (1837–1920) was the
      novelist and "Dean of American Letters" who wrote <em>The Rise of
         Silas Lapham</em> (1885) among other works. He described his first meeting
      with Walt Whitman at Pfaff's in <em>Literary Friends and
         Acquaintances</em> (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1900), 73–76.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0323">10. William Ingram, a Quaker, kept a tea
      store—William Ingram and Son Tea Dealers–in Philadelphia. Of Ingram,
      Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "He is a man of the Thomas Paine
      stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
      alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of
      prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">Sunday, May 20, 1888</a>).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07535_n5">11. When William Ingram
      called on August 3, Walt Whitman gave him a copy of <em>Specimen
         Days</em> for George Rush, Jr., who was in prison in Bucks Country,
      Pennsylvania (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Ingram's
      letter of  reported how gratified
      Rush was to receive the gift and recounted in great detail the death and
      cremation of the "free thinker" William Cooper.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4983">12. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07535_n6">13. McKay had 950 copies to
      sell, 50 copies were distributed to reviewers, and Whitman retained 100 copies,
      some of which he sold but many of which he gave to friends.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">14. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
