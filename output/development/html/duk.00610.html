   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00610_n4">1. This letter dates to May 13
      or May 14, 1873. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter early 1873. Edwin
      Haviland Miller dated it about May 17, 1873 (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:220, n. 85). Miller's date is more accurate than Bucke's, but a slightly
      earlier date (May 13 or May 14) can be inferred from Walt Whitman's letter in
      response and from Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman's report on Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's condition. Walt's mother had described "a trembling in my whole
      system" in her  letter, and he was
      alarmed by his mother's letter (see his  reply). Louisa's next brief letter, which instructed Walt "don't
      send any more papers," was hardly reassuring (see her  to Walt). Then her almost daily letters to Walt
      stopped. Louisa was apparently unable to write Walt for several days, and this
      letter is the next one he received. Walt acknowledged a letter, probably this
      one, the following week as "your letter yesterday (Thursday)" (see his , , and  letters to
      Louisa). Louisa Orr Whitman's report on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's condition,
      that she "feel[s] better this morning," is in accord with Walt's description in
      his May 16, 1873 letter. To be consistent both with the extended absence of
      letters after Louisa's May 6 or 7, 1873 letter to Walt and with her reported
      improvement in Louisa Orr's  letter to
      Walt, this letter is the one that Walt received on Thursday, May 15.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00610_n5">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman at
      the onset of this event, presumably a stroke, described "trembling in my whole
      system" (see her  letter to
      Walt Whitman). Based on the deterioration of her handwriting in that letter and
      the absence of letters for several days, she may have suffered a second and more
      incapacitating event. This letter is the first that she sent after the event,
      though Walt had inquired anxiously for news for several days. On May 11 he wrote
      that he would "feel anxious until I hear from you"; two days later he asked his
      mother to "try to write a line soon after you get this" (see Walt's  and  letters to Louisa).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00610_n2">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      improved condition is consistent with a letter that Walt Whitman received from
      Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman on May 15, 1873. Walt reported, "I have got a letter
      from Sister Lou written Thursday morning, which gives me great relief, as it
      says that Sunday was your worst day, &amp; that you have got relief now" (see
      Walt's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00597_n3">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son Edward moved from Brooklyn to
      reside with them in Camden in August 1872. For more information on George, see
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00610_n8">5. See the extended description
      of the house that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman speculated she and her son could
      share in her  letter to Walt Whitman.
      Walt prompted this fantasy by suggesting the same a few weeks earlier: "if you
      &amp; I had a house here" (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">6. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
