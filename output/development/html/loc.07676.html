      Dear Walt, 
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I write you briefly this morning before starting on my 2 week vacation to Delaware
      Co. I 
      rec'd the pocket book copy<sup><a href="#med.00869_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> of L.G. 
      &amp; prize it very highly. It is unique, I was very sorry I could not see you on the
      day you
      was 70 years old. All that time I was having  
      one of my streaks of insomnia, &amp;
        
      was very wretched for two or three weeks. It has worn off &amp; I am feeling much better.
   </p>
   
   <p>The summer has been a very busy one with me. The young grape vines grow so fast that
      it keeps me going to tie them 
      up to the stakes. I go about all day with two balls of twine at my side, training
      the young vines in the way 
      they should go, &amp; <u>tying</u> them in that way.
   </p>
   
   <p>I do hope you keep about, I wish some good masculine angel would come &amp; lift you out
      of Camden, bag &amp; baggage 
      &amp; set you down here, or   
      or by the sea, or in the mountains A change of air now would greatly add to the length
      of your days. You ought to 
      know this, &amp; I will not bore you with it. I hear from Horace now &amp; then, always gladly.
      
      I have not seen O'Connor's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r9">9</a></sup> reviews of Donnelly's<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r10">10</a></sup> Reviewers.<sup><a href="#loc.07305_n3" id="r11">11</a></sup> If you have a copy send it to me at 
      Hobart N.Y. &amp; I will return it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="loc.07676_n2">3. Bucke's letter is not
      extant, but Whitman summarized its contents for Traubel: "Doctor's last letter was
      written in a terrible strain: he proposes to me that, Mrs. O'Connor having no
      place her own now—nothing to do—that we somehow set up a
      bargain—that she keep house for me—that we go into alliance, get
      spliced" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.97.html">Saturday, July 13, 1889</a>). Bucke's reasoning was not an illogical deduction from Mrs.
      O'Connor's letter of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r6">[back]

      grew up in Mooretown, Upper Canada. She was the daughter of William Gurd, an 
      army officer from Ireland. Jessie married Richard Maurice Bucke in 1865. The couple
      had eight children.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00869_n3">8. Whitman had a limited pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. See Whitman's , letter to Oldach. For more

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n4108">10. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="loc.07305_n3">11. In his pamphlet <em>Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers</em> (Chicago: Belford, Clarke &amp;
      Co., 1889), O'Connor attempted to defend Ignatius Donnelly's Baconian theories,
      as found in <em>The Great Crytogram</em> (1887).<a href="#r11">[back]
