      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am happy to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of April 24th. I appreciate your candor
      and friendliness and would reciprocate. I believe we agree pretty nearly in theory
      at least. I can hardly see how two reasonable persons can differ materially on so
      important a subject as culture, when they come to understand each other,  of course we must have
      culture. We can be nothing without it either as a nation, or as individuals. We do
      not want Crab apples either in literature, or politics or religion or manners, be
      the fullest fruit nature can bring forth.
   </p>
   
   <p>I should differ from you perhaps as to the relative importance of artificial culture
      (culture from books art, society exclusively) to the production of a national
      literature, and the broader  culture of life and of real things. The question with me is not
      what will 
      conduse
      
       to the production of scholars or a clan of witty, elegant and accomplished
      <u>[
         <span class="unclear">litteratures?</span>]
         </u> for
      these obscure the true ends of literature as the priests pervert religion; but what
      comparts with grand primary bards upon whom a nation can build, I think of Homers
      Teachers and of 
      Shakspeare
      
       and of all monumental everlasting men, and I see how little what is now
      called culture  had to
      do with what they were or what they achieved.
   </p>
   
   <p>Whether or not we have culture enough in America, it is plain that there is as yet
      no
      full fruition of culture here, no triumph of the man [
      <span class="unclear">frality?</span>]
       in our literature over the conventional,
      and what is worse, is not likely to be.
   </p>
   
   <p>The matter often shapes itself to me in some such formula as this: The first step
      in
      culture is marked by a love for, and an acquiescence in, the Artificial; the second
      step shows a revolt against the artificial as in  Byron; the third and last step which
      not one poet in a century takes, shows no revolt against society, or civilization
      or
      art, but an absorption of them and a rising above them. I do not see as any of our
      own popular poets have ever taken the second step, the step which disturbs and
      unsettles and [
      <span class="unclear">presages?</span>]
      
      new things. To me Longfellow, as sweet and gentle a spirit as he is, is no more
      tonic than confectionery is. Lowell's whip has got a good snapper on it and he knows
      how to make  it crack
      like a pistol, but is that enough?
   </p>
   
   <p>I think Emerson has taken the last step
      in man and in religion, but the only modern who has taken it in art according to my
      judgment, is Walt Whitman. From the standpoint of culture I regard <u>Leaves of Grass</u> as a supreme work. It shows a maturity of
      the man beyond any other modern poemâ€”the man, done with toys, done with
      ornaments, done with criticism, and solemnly confronting the terrible beauty and
      majesty  of things.
   </p>
   
   <p>You must allow me the frankness to say that I think you do not understand it. You
      look into it for what the fact had no design of putting there at least of nothing
      the main matter, namely genius, specimen's "five things" highly wrought intellectual
      proclaim work &amp;c. It must be understood at the outset that this poem does not
      enter into competition with other modern works with reference to these things. It
      differs from them just as the landscape differs from a flower garden. It is
      absolutely new both in the  theory of art upon which it is based and in the such which the
      poet had in view. This theory of Art I have attempted to <u>suggest</u> in my book. It is briefly this: That nature affords the only
      adequate standard for a first class modern artist, that to elaborate is of no avail,
      but to hint, to stimulate to self going, is everything. Nature is perpetual
      transition. Everything passes &amp; presses on; there is no pause, no completion, no
      exhaustive elaboration. To produce and multiply endlessly and 
      men
      of the most liberal and ample culture. To partially cultivated people he is
      meaningless and repulsive.
   </p>
   
   <p>You are wrong in saying I think the West superior to the East as respects literature
      or general culture. It would be silly to affirm such a thing. I think the West is
      <u>prospectively</u> superior to the East. I think a type of
      character is forming there which will eclipse anything that has yet appeared in the
      Atlantic States, though that character may be yet a long way off from literature.
      
      commit herself to no
      end or scheme is the law of nature. Something like this is in <u>Leaves of Grass</u>. A hint, a sound, a germ, a stroke, a significant book,
      and on the author goes, follow who can.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am as little in love with endeavors, and awkward or bungling worksmanship as you
      are, or with [
      <span class="unclear">aerid?</span>]
      
      unripe fruit, and any such thing in Walt Whitman would be his instant condemnation
      to me. Again, [
      <span class="unclear">I?</span>]
       any such
      charge I set the fact, that his moral heart recognition both in this country and
      Europe has been from. 
      Neither did I wish to be understood as refering to
      "Kathiren" 
      as a work of true culture. It perhaps represents the average culture of the churches
      and schools, and its author has doubtless been cultivated fully up to his capacity
      for culture.
   </p>
   
   <p>I appreciate the need of good nature and hearty cooperation among literary men as
      much as any one, but we must be aware what price we are paying for them, I think
      Lessings example as a critic is a good one for young men to emulate, and  that soft words are
      not always the best. The class of poets and critics who aspire to foster and lead
      public taste in this country are intensely obnoxious to me, because I see they are
      the sworn enemies of any large generous growth. The great standards and the
      principles of universal nature need to be revised and enforced at all hazards.

      <br></br>John Burroughs
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P. S. Let me call your attention to Whitman's paper on <u>Personalism</u> in the May "Salary" which I think contains the deepest
      layer word ever spoken upon the subject of culture

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837â€“1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
