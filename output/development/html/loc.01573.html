      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In response to your letter of the 5th instant, which has just reached me, I have to
      say that I accept the proposal made in it respecting your English publication of my
      poems—&amp; hereby agree that you have the privilege of selling that
      publication in the United States, on payment to me, or my agent, of a royalty of one
      shilling, (or 25 cents gold,) upon every copy sold in the U. S.<sup><a href="#loc.01573_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course it is distinctly understood that this grant from me does not affect my
      copyright here, but that said copyright, in each of its particulars &amp; in the
      whole, is absolutely fully &amp; exclusively retained by me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is not improbable that a very handsome &amp; steady sale of the English volume
      may be effected here, by the right business manipulation, a moderate, judicious
      advertising &amp;c. My book has never been really published here at all
      &amp; the market is in a sort vacant of supplies. I will probably suggest to you
      something more on these points, in a future letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received yesterday a letter from Mr. Conway, conveying your proposition, to which
      I
      mailed an immediate answer, to the same effect as herewith. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Accept my thanks for the <em>William Blake</em>.<sup><a href="#loc.01573_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> It has not yet come from the post office, but I know
      it will prove to me a profoundly interesting study, and a handsome gift. It is, in
      fact, a book I was wanting.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After the reception of the copy you speak of—my own volume—(now
      probably on its way)—I shall doubtless have occasion to express genuine
      pleasure—with gratitude both to its editor &amp; publisher.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now, my dear sir, please accept with my trust in the success of the enterprise
      my
      kindest respects to yourself personally. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Camden Hotten (1832–1873) re-issued
      Algernon Charles Swinburne's first <em>Poems and Ballads</em> in
      1866 after the public outcry caused Swinburne's previous publisher to withdraw.
      Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten
      introduced such writers as Robert Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
      and Bret Harte to an English audience. After his death, his business was
      purchased by Chatto &amp; Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866,
      O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems
      to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). Walt Whitman
      was dissatisfied with Hotten's work, referring to the publisher as "the English
      pirate-publisher" in a , letter to
      Rudolf Schmidt. For Whitman's relationship with Hotten and the "bad &amp;
      defective" edition, see Whitman's , letter to Moncure D. Conway.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01573_n1">1. This draft letter is

      D. Conway, to which Whitman responded in his  letter to Conway.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01573_n3">3. Hotten was the publisher
      of this critical essay, which Whitman had expected in his  letter to Moncure D. Conway.
      Swinburne at the conclusion of <em>William Blake: A Critical
         Essay</em> (1868), 300–303, pointed out similarities between Walt
      Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
      Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
      sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." Included in <em>Songs before Sunrise</em> (1871) was his famous lyric "To Walt
      Whitman in America." For the story of Swinburne's veneration of Walt Whitman and
      his later recantation, see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in
         England</em> (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1934),
