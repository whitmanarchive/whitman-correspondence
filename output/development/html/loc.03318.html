      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have this morning received your card of the 11th rec'd. <u>
         Spec.
         
          Days in America</u> makes its appearance in the London book-shops
      to-morrow, &amp; before you get this I expect you will have a preliminary batch of
      six copies of the volume. I am writing to the publishers to-day to instruct them
      about sending the 50 more you want. The publishers seem to have made some mistake
      about the <u>Preface</u> &amp; <u>Addl
         note</u> printed slips. I gave them distinct instructions about sending them,
      &amp; I must just make them pay for their mistake by sending you further copies of
      the book to supply the omission. I enclose two cut-out leaves which they sent to me
      last week, with some vague idea of atonement, I suppose.
   </p>
   
   <p>Yesterday afternoon J. Addington Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r1">1</a></sup> called here
      unexpectedly when I had a pile of the 
      Spec
      
       Days 
      Vols.
      
       on the table, &amp; he was delighted with the appearance, &amp;c. of the
      book. I took him a copy on going to dine with him &amp; Roden Noel<sup><a href="#n3109" id="r2">2</a></sup> in Eaton Square last night. I sent copies off to many other
      folk yesterday,—Mrs. Costelloe<sup><a href="#n6109" id="r3">3</a></sup> among the rest. She wrote
      me a nice little note about it, which arrived this morning. Gabriel Sarrazin, the
      young French critic, who is writing a study of L. of G., which he is tremendously
      taken with, shall have one to-day or to-morrow.<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r4">4</a></sup>
       I feel quite
      proud at being the agent &amp; deputy of the book in this way. It gives me quite a
      new conception of my own importance in the world. I do hope you will like the
      general get-up of the book, &amp; so on. If we have made any slips in this respect
      in the book, we can profit by them in the <u>Democratic
         Vistas</u>
      
      vol.
      
       the 
      addl
      
       papers for which I look forward to receiving.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was glad to hear &amp; read in the papers you sent of the brilliant success of the
      Lincoln Lecture.<sup><a href="#loc.03318_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> How I wish you could come over here
      &amp; deliver it too; but I suppose that may not be. The gathering of the 
      literarati
      
       in the audience was very significant. It shows a new departure, I think,
      on the scholastic literary side.
   </p>
   
   <p>By this time I expect Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r6">6</a></sup> is with you &amp; has
      given you a general account of things over here. (Give him my hearty greetings!) By
      him I sent a batch of birthday wishes for the 31st, which I follow now with all
      imaginable devout orisons. In your coming year I earnestly hope you will have the great gratification of seeing a deeper &amp;
      wider application of Leaves of Grass, pointing to a nearer consummation of their
      great idea than we have hitherto deemed possible! And, so, with deep love, I
      am
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0615">1. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3109">2. Roden Noel (1834–1894) was an
      English poet, critic, and admirer of Whitman. Noel's "A Study of Walt Whitman:
      The Poet of Modern Democracy" (<em>Dark Blue</em> 2 [October
      1871], 241–253), spoke glowingly of the poet, describing him as "tall,
      colossal, luxuriant, unpruned, like some giant tree in a primeval forest. . . .
      He springs out of that vast American continent full-charged with all that is
      special and national in it" (242).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6109">3. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." For more information
      about Costelloe, see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3115">4. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03318_n1">5. James B. Pond, Whitman's
      lecture manager, recounts the event as follows: "It was indeed a picturesque
      spectacle at Walt's last appearance in the Madison Square Theatre, on Lincoln's
      birthday. Just as he was about to recite 'My Captain,' a little girl, the
      granddaughter of Edmund Clarence Stedman, walked out upon the stage and
      presented him with a beautiful bouquet of roses" (<em>Eccentricities of Genius</em>, G. W. Dillingham Co: New York, 1900,
      497).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0262">6. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
