      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I once more take the liberty of sending you a few lines to enquire if you have
      received the small Box of Books I sent you on the 8th April per Suttons Parcel
      Despatch.<sup><a href="#loc.01449_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I enclose again the list of the contents
      of the Box. I have been expecting a letter from you these 2 weeks, and so thought
      I
      had better write you again in case they had not reached you safely, because  the longer we delay
      the report of items not arriving safe, the more difficult it becomes to trace where
      they may have been sent to in mistake. I also learn you have written a reply to T.
      Carlyle's American Iliad in a Nutshell. If you possess a Copy of it, I would like
      to
      have one, also a copy of the original preface to Leaves of Grass. Not now being in
      possession of the original copy of the Poem, I miss the preface from your recent
      Editions much.—In fact I regret very much that you have excluded the preface from
      your recent Editions, and English Readers would no doubt like to see a Copy of your
      letter to Emerson<sup><a href="#n0218" id="r2">2</a></sup> on American Literature, in reply to his
      letter to you. Copies of Emersons letter I have sent to several friends of mine here
      interested in your Poems. Are you ever in New York? I have at present staying there,
      if not located there for Life, two friends from our town. Men that I know would be
      glad to see you and who would give you some details of  English Life, Literature, Politics, and
      [illegible] likewise,
      and who I should be glad to hear had seen you, and also became friends of yours.
      there is a certain natural talent in them both. one of them has written a few
      Articles for the Tribune on Cooperation and Trade's Unions. The new matters here in
      a Literary way that may be of interest to Note you is the successful result of the
      Publication of D. G. Rossetti's<sup><a href="#n0521" id="r3">3</a></sup> Poems got into the second
      Edition in 14 Days after first Publication, and the next is a series of lectures in
      the Science of Religion by [illegible] appearing in Frasers Mag every month also a great success. And
      last not least the public appearance in London of Chunder Sen the 
      Hindoo
      
       Theist, who is now greatly sought after by all classes of advanced
      thinkers in London. 
      And through his being here some few advanced thinkers in London (people who admire
      your Countryman Theo Parker's<sup><a href="#n0463" id="r4">4</a></sup> Works) are anxious to 
      inaugrate
      
       some Body of People who shall publicly carry out and advocate these
      teachings amongst us, in fact endeavour to form a Body of Religious People who shall
      truly acknowledge in their daily Life and Needs the fellowship and Brotherhood of
      all Men, and God the Father of all. One God, and one Religion, and that Religion in
      practice each Member trying to do his and her Duty to each other faithfully and
      honestly. see Magazine. Duties of Man, the New Gospel to our Time and peoples. In fact in the small
      Collection you will find all and more then I can write and tell you about of the
      leading ideas and thoughts I sympathize with, and live in hopes of seeing someday
      come to pass amongst us all. and Humanity seems fast moving on to that Noble Epoch,
      despite the changes and groans of some of them—I myself largely sympathize with the
      Quaker teaching <u>No Priesthood</u>, and would fain know
      something of your Mind on this Matter, and also of Hicks teachings whose name I see
      coupled with yours.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon (1831–1880), a corkcutter of
      Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In 1856
      he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a book
      peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to William
      Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and represented
      the ideal laborer of John Ruskin, who printed many of his own letters to the
      corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto
      (1892), II, 32–33, 267–269; Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt
         Whitman in England</em> (1934), 15–17; <em>The Works of
         John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), XVII,
      lxxviii–lxxix.

      American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
      1836 essay <em>Nature</em>. On , Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "" was "put in type for my own convenience,
      and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
      T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, who promptly
      accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome

      painter. His highly stylized portraits of women influenced the development of
      the Symbolist movement in Europe. His brother William Michael Rossetti was one

      abolitionist, transcendentalist, and social reformer who as a Unitarian minister
      drew controversy for denying the authenticity of the Bible, which he saw as
      contradictory and mistaken. Much of Parker's language on secular issues,
      however, has survived by inspiring Abraham Lincoln, Betty Friedan, Martin Luther
      King, Jr., and others.<a href="#r4">[back]
