      <br></br><br></br>Dear Dear Uncle Walt
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How do you feel now. I wrote to Grandma yesterday
      evening&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Mama's death was
      very unexpected here the day was so pleasant that she asked
      Papa to take her out riding and Papa said he would so
      he brought up the buggy and lifted Mama in he then went to take the reins and just
      then Mama said. Now wait till I get my dress fixed and Papa waited  and then she
      fell over &amp; never spoke another word when I came home&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      from school I found that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Dear Mama was dying. when&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I left for school in the morning Mama said she felt better
      that she had the best 
      nights
      
       sleep in a long while it was such a shock to me I had run about two blocks
      to see her I saw the buggy outside of the door and I felt so glad that I could see
      her before she went out but when I came in I saw her pale face and I did not know
      what to do
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a very large funeral the office was closed so that all the commissioners came.
       Grandma must
      have felt very badly when she heard it Poor Dear Mama died 14 of 8 on Wednesday
      evening we had a large number of friends here but no one could do her any good I
      think it is better for Mama that she is dead she suffered <u>so</u> much. Mr Lane came out he got here on saturday
      morning he would have been here on friday morning but he was left he just got to the
      depot to see the cars start
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Every body
      
       is very kind out here but if one of you would only be here it would be so
      pleasant for Papa Dear Papa feels so badly I do not know how we can  hardly live
      without Dear Mama. You do not know how hard it was to see her die but she knew me
      when I got home though she could not speak to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>It has been very cold here but it is 
      quiet
      
       pleasant today. Jessie has gone to school so I am home
      all alone with the girls
   </p>
   
   <p>If I only could see Dear Grandma I think I would be happy but as I cannot I suppose
      I
      shall have to go without seeing her
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just got home from market but it is not of hardly any use to try to get Papa
      any thing to eat 
      as he 
      wont
      
       eat anything
   </p>
   
   <p>Mama deceived me very much her face was so 
      swolen
      
       that she looked so well and she never gave up: I 
      all ways
      
       thought that she would be in bed a few days before she died but she was
      not. She was dressed so nicely and neatly that she beautiful after she died but she
      did not look very natural the swelling went down and it altered her face very much
      indeed
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. Fladhas just been  here. I am hardly ever alone now
      we both sleep with Papa&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      and that is so nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      When Papa telegraphed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      we did not receive an answer for above two days and a half
      so it kept us very anxious some one has been here all night ever since Mama died
      Papa was holding 
      Mamas
      
       head and she would breath easy one 
      breadth
      
       and the breath hard she continued this way for three hours and a half and
      then she drew her last 
      breadth
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The time flies very quickly I have some little things to do every day so that I am
      kept 
      quiet
      
       busy We received 
      grandmas
      
      
       letter but it
      was 
      to
      
       late for Mama to ever read it I read it it was such a nice letter that it
      was 
      to
      
       bad that it did not come a day before
   </p>
   
   <p>Mama would have been so glad to have read it We got some of 
      Mamas
      
       pictures yesterday Papa says he would send you one now but we have only
      two one large and one small so that he wants to keep them till he can get the rest
      and then he will send you all some&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Now Uncle Walt I am
      getting tired so
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Good Bye Darling Uncle
      <br></br>Hattie
   </p>
   
   
   <p>P.S. They all sent love to you</p>

      mamas
      
       coffin
