      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir–
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Knowing of your illness, through newspaper reports, I do not
      like to intrude anything upon you, but think perhaps you &amp; those standing
      near you would like to know of the latest said on Leaves of Grass,– 
      or rather on printed  extracts from it— for which "offence" I was arrested
      by Anthony Comstock,<sup><a href="#n4286" id="r1">1</a></sup> Oct 26, &amp; am held for trial (first-hearing), Nov. 16, 
      in U.S. Court, 140 Tremont St. Boston, before Commissioner Henry L. 
      Hallett. Nov 2, 1877, Comstock came as "E. Edgewell," a Free Lover; this time
      he is a Labor Reformer, masked under three different aliases &amp; telling a
      dozen lies to get what he calls evidence.  As Mar 18, 1873 he wrote from Washing.
      to furnish truth, ideas not brains to readers. 
      I inclose  one of the slips– the bit of red–cloth 
      which now enrages the United–States, ecclesiastical bull tearing towards us. Human
      language
      contains no finer type of manly sympathy for the supported "fallen," no more 
      impressive portraiture of the divinity of motherhood than is apparent in these two
      "obsene" 
      poems. I inclose also the Resolution accepted by the N.E. Free Love Convention in Boston 
      last May, in which Dr. J.H. Savain, the old–time Anti–Slavery, Woman Suffrage, 
      &amp; Socialistic reformer read these two poems, to the people assembled, three times,
      
      at as many different sessions, as the most significant &amp; interesting scriptures 
      of these times presentable.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Since my release, by President Hayes,<sup><a href="#n4287" id="r2">2</a></sup> Dec 19, 1878, from Dedham Jail, 
      where I was serving out a two–years sentence for alleged–mailing a copy of my own
      book, 
      Cupids Yokes, I was slowly becoming comparatively "respectable" again, when lo, 
      suddenly, I am "of no reputation"! As a notable instance of what you call 
      "color–blindness" I inclose a clip, from the last 
      Truth Seeker, written by Editor D.M. Bennett<sup><a href="#n4288" id="r3">3</a></sup> who himself served out a years sentence 
      in Albany Penitentiary for alleged–mailing of Cupids Yokes. What have citizens 
      done that they are afraid or ashamed now? I was glad to reprint–extended extracts
      
      from a Philadelphia paper, relative to your book, in Nov. Word &amp; will send you it
      
      soon. As you doubtless know, your book is openly advertised in at least one Boston
      
      newspaper, Benj. R. Tucker,<sup><a href="#n4290" id="r4">4</a></sup> the editor  of Liberty, inviting <u>defying</u> Oliver Stevens, Anthony Comstock, Postmaster Tobey<sup><a href="#n4289" id="r5">5</a></sup> or any 
      other repressive Regulator of morals to order a copy which he promises to <u>send by mail</u> 
      or otherwise deliver to any address! It is also freely sold on the streets by Josephine
      
      S. Tilton, the persistent Socialist once imprisoned for her Faith– many buying 
      it indeed in bookstores &amp; at news stands all over New England. Though the 
      "sealed order" of events, which we all must obey, sent Comstock up here, to our 
      Mountain– Home perch in the Air, to snatch me, a comparatively old jail–bird, 
      first, Mr. Tucker, if they conceal me, will very likely next be "elected" as one 
      of my fellow convicts in Dedham Jail. The end years in the form; rejoicing in the
      poetic fervor, the devine Afflatus 
      which you incarnate I am ever your greatly indebted reader,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4286">1. Anthony Comstock (1844–1915)
      was an American Postal Inspector and politician, whose name became synonymous
      with censorship of cultural artifacts that were perceived as lascivious or
      immoral. In 1873, Comstock founded the New York Society for the Suppression of
      Vice, and convinced Congress to pass the "Comstock Laws" which criminalized the
      "Trade in, and Circulation of Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use"
      through the U.S. Postal Service. For more on Comstock, see Nicola Kay Beisel,
      <em>Imperiled Innocents: Anthony Comstock and Family
         Reproduction in Victorian America</em> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton
      University Press, 1997).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4287">2. Rutherford B. Hayes
      (1822–1893) was the 19th President of United States (1877–1881), who
      oversaw the end of Reconstruction. Among his numerous civil service reforms,
      Hayes sought to disrupt the postal service's corrupt "star route" contract
      profiteering by denying new route contracts. He later indicted Second Assistant
      Postmaster-General Thomas J. Brady of conspiracy. For more on Hayes and the
      "Star Route Scandal," see Wayne E. Fuller, <em>Morality and the
         Mail in Nineteenth-century America</em> (Chicago: University of Illinois
