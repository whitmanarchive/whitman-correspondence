   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1029">1. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00814_n1">2. On December 11, 1887,
      Julius Chambers of the <em>New York Herald</em> asked Walt Whitman
      to write a poem to commemorate John Greenleaf Whittier's eightieth birthday. The
      poet replied on , and on December 14
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book; Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) sent "As
      the Greek's Signal Flame [For Whittier's eightieth birthday, December 17,
      1887]," which was printed in the <em>Herald</em> on the following
      day. Although Whitman asked twenty dollars, he was paid twenty-five (Whitman's
      Commomplace Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4155">3. James Gordon Bennett Jr.
      (1841–1918) was the editor and publisher of the <em>New York
         Herald</em>, founded by his father in 1835. Julius Chambers
      (1850–1920) was an American author, investigative journalist, and travel
      writer; after working as a reporter for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em>, he became an editor of the <em>New York
         Herald</em> and, later, managing editor of the <em>New York
         World</em>. For more on the <em>Herald</em> and the many poems
      by Whitman that were published in it, see Susan Belasco, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/periodical_titles/per.00104.html">The <em>New York Herald</em></a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
