   <p>A thousand thanks, dear Walt, for your note of 10th enclosing M.S.<sup><a href="#loc.07119_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> of O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> piece. You know I guess
      by this time that Mrs O'C.<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r3">3</a></sup> is pleased with the
      "preface"—In her last letter to me she says "yes, I am very much pleased with
      what Walt has written." She only wishes (like me) that it was longer—but it is
      as long (I guess) as either of us expected it would be. And, in fact,
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I do not know but it is long enough. I am real glad to hear that "Old Poets"<sup><a href="#loc.07119_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> has gone—shall hope to read it soon. This morning
      came your card of 12th<sup><a href="#loc.07119_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> do not worry about me, I am
      better and shall be down without fail<sup><a href="#loc.07119_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—expect to reach Phila Sunday morning,
      have written Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r7">7</a></sup> to meet me at Dooner's to breakfast that
      day—hope to see you toward noon—same day—Sunday—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No, my arm was not broken, bad bruise was all<sup><a href="#loc.07119_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup>—it is
      much better but still a little stiff and weak. I have the big poster today from
      Horace—I judge all is going well and I hope we shall have a big crowd. You
      will not, of course, write here again at present—I leave London Saturday
      forenoon

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4137">3. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
