      <br></br><br></br>Dear friends
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We arrived here all safe at last—(after adventures)—had to cross the river late of
      a dark night in broken ice, in a little row boat, mid a furious snow storm (this house
      is on the west bank Hudson)—the natives advised us not to try it, but Harry &amp; I said
      <em>cross</em>, &amp; Mr. Burroughs consented—it was quite interesting—It looks like winter here, snow
      8 inches deep in every direction—but I like it much—a far view from my window of miles
      of river, mountains, rocks &amp; woods—quite a change of scene from N Y—We are very comfortable here, folks are (as every where) very kind to us—Harry has
      gone across the river in a row boat with Mr B. all the forenoon—&amp; I have spent mine
      alone in the library writing, &amp; frequently looking out at the grand show of scenery,
      in winter garb—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Love to <em>you all</em>, to Al and May, and the childer—to Mr Waters—(&amp; even the picture)—May return either
      Tuesday or Wednesday for a couple of days or so—<sup><a href="#uva.00380_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
