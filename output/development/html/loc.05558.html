   <p>But a few moments ago in an unknown country paper a paragraph with a "fling" at your
      poetry attracted my attention, and under the impulse of the moment, with an
      undefined purpose of assuring you of the love and reverence in which you are held
      by
      thousands, I took up my pen.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If the recognition of you has not been as demonstrative as that awarded to some
      others it is because your thought is in advance of your generation, and it will be
      the privelege of another age to award what this shortsighted one has neglected. Let
      one who sincerely reverences you as a <u>man</u> and admires you
      as a <u>poet</u> thank you for the example of your life and the 
      heretage
      
       of song you will leave to your race.
   </p>
