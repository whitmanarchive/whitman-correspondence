      <br></br><br></br>Dear &amp; honoured Friend &amp; Master
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thank you from my heart for the gift of your great book—that beautiful
      complete book of your poems &amp; your prose, which I call "Whitman's Bible."<sup><a href="#loc.04191_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>But my heart has not the power to make my brain &amp; hands tell you how much I thank
      you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>None of your eleves, your disciples, will be able to tell the world what they have
      gained from you, what they owe to you, what you are for them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot even attempt to tell yourself (upon this page of paper with this pen in my
      hand), what it is that makes me ask you how to bless me.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>If my health, riven to the bottom like a tree in me, twelve years ago,—&amp;
      the cares of a family, complicated with this affair of health—had not
      prevented, I should long ago had come to see you in the flesh, to ask counsel of
      you, &amp; to assure you of my inviolable fidelity.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are both growing old, &amp; nearly half a hemisphere divides us. Yet nothing can
      divide souls, or separate that which is inseparable in the divine nature of the
      world.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Perhaps we shall yet meet: &amp; then, beyond the death of this life, I shall ask you
      about things which have perplexed me here—to which I think you alone could
      have given me an acceptable answer. All such matters will probably sink into their proper place
      in the infinite perspective; &amp; when we meet, a comrade's hand-touch &amp; a kiss
      will satisfy me, &amp; a look into your eyes.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But, if we come to be judged, I shall go to the judgment-seat &amp; say: "Call out
      Walt Whitman. Let him pronounce upon the doings of this man this one; &amp; let me
      be contracted with him; before you judges pass your sentence."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot find words better fitted to express the penetrative force with which you
      have entered into me, my reliance on you, &amp; my hope that you will not disapprove
      of my conduct in the last resort.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As I cannot talk to you, I feel the need to say this; becuase you have exercised a
      controlling influence over me for half a century. It is not often, I take it, that one man
      can say so much as I am saying to a man whom he has never seen.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Those lines which I wrote in September of this year,<sup><a href="#loc.04191_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      &amp; which I am glad to see now circulated, were calculated for the public mind!
      They do not tell the half; but, as an old Greek proverb puts it, "the half is better
      than the whole"—in print at any rate.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I read your Bible, I miss—&amp; I had missed for many years in new
      editions—the poem which first thrilled me like a trumpet-call to you. It was
      called: "Long I thought that knowledge alone would suffice me" [Calamus 8. ed:
      1860–61].<sup><a href="#loc.04191_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Why have you so consistently omitted
      this in the canon of your works?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Upon me, your disciple, it made a decisive impact. "I put down the book, filled with the bitterest envy."<sup><a href="#loc.04191_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> And I rose up, to follow you. I miss the words
      now.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am old now, &amp; you are older in years, though everlastingly young, in ways not
      given to all men to be so. So perhaps I ought not ask why you omitted that poem from
      "Calamus," &amp; what you meant by it. It means for me so infinitely much. I cannot
      say how much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well: the disciple weighs his master's words, too scrupulously—&amp; thinks
      perhaps too much of his omissions or dark sayings. He must not ask for answers to
      his questions, but express the total of the teaching in his works &amp; ways.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>That I shall do ever, so far as I am your man—marked with your seal &amp;
      superscription, &amp; what my addiction to you will later bring forth, is a matter for
      the literary historians of England to decide—if only I had life &amp; time for
      future looking.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>More &amp; more of you will be found in me, the longer I live &amp; the firmer I
      become in manhood.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Goodnight, dear man!</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Horatio Forbes Brown: "Old Walt Whitman sends me, with autograph and inscription
      in his shaky hand, the final and complete edition of his works—one book, a
      sort of Bible. It is a grand present to the spirit, and (for the future) of
      incalculable pecuniary value." See <em>The Letters of John
