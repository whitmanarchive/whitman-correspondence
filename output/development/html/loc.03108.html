   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Samuel Sidney McClure
      (1857–1949) was the co-founder and editor of <em>McClure's
         Magazine</em>. Well-known for its investigative journalism, the illustrated
      monthly initially rejected Whitman's submissions and only posthumously published
      some of his poetry (in 1897).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03108_n1">1. Whitman is referring to the
      poem ultimately titled "A Christmas Greeting." In his , letter to Richard Maurice Bucke the poet refers to
      the poem as "the little 'Northern Star-Group to a Southern' (welcome to
      Brazilian Republic)." This would become the poem's subtitle: "From a Northern
      Star-Group to a Southern. 1889–'90." See also "," a manuscript draft of this poem.<a href="#r1">[back]
