   <p>Your letter has just been received, and thought you would like to have an early answer.
      I am glad to have the room as I need it and will do the best I can to accommodate
      you. The bedstead, springs, mattress, one feather pillow, &amp; two hair ones, basin &amp;
      pitcher the three tumblers &amp; one small pitcher I could make use of. They are not what
      I should have bought out of the store
   </p> 
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>they have been used by you for some time; I have never used the room or things, if
      you do not ask too much for them I will take them—please write as soon as you get
      this &amp; let me know what you want for them as I am anxious to have all the cleaning
      done before the [
      <span class="unclear">&amp;c?</span>]
       return.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Besides those things there are ten chairs two old tables, rocking chair looking glass
      &amp; wollen spread that I cannot use for any thing, but if you tell me what you want for them
      I might dispose of them for you, so please let me know their value. I will keep your
      other things in
      
      
      safty for you as you wish; and will first state here that I would not have written to worry
      you about the money if I had not wanted it very particularly before the &amp;c absence
      I did not think it would inconvenience you to much—Please write just as soon as you
      get this as I will be anxious to [

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman stayed with Dr. George
      A. White, a chiropodist, and his wife Isabella A. White from March 1, 1871,
      until Whitman left Washington. Whitman had paid $236 in rent through June
      10, 1873 (The Library of Congress #73). On November 28, 1873, Dr. acknowledged
      for his wife receipt of $28 "on account . . . for rent of room etc from May
      1st/73" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Walt Whitman gave up one room at the
      Whites' on June 10, 1873: "Kept the other at $2.50 a month" (The Library of
      Congress #68). According to a letter dated , Isabella White had written, evidently early in July, about the
      rent due for his room; Whitman's reply is not extant. On the 29th, White offered
      to purchase Walt Whitman's bedstead and certain other effects. Walt Whitman had
      not settled his account when White wrote again on , and offered him a credit of $10 for his
      furnishings against a balance of $38. These letters are in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection.(See also Walt Whitman's , letter to Peter Doyle, in which Whitman left instructions for
      the delivery of his boxes from the Whites.)
