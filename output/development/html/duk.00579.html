   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00579_n11">1. This letter dates to April
      14, 1869. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to April 1869, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:367). April 14 fell on Wednesday in 1869, and the calendar date 14 and the day
      of the week Wednesday are in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Neither Louisa's
      most recent letter to Walt Whitman nor the letter she received from Walt, his
      April 13?, 1869 letter, is extant. But her son George Washington Whitman's
      receipt of a $200 bank draft from Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman is consistent
      with Jeff's expectation earlier that month that he would send the draft on about
      April 5, 1869. See Jeff's  letter to
      Walt. The year 1869 is also consistent with new fashions in bonnets and the
      appointment of postmaster Samuel Booth, both of which are reported by the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> in spring 1869.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n12">3. See Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's April 5, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman (Berthold and Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt</em>, 140–142).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n18">4. In exchange for a mortgage,
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had agreed to lend his brother George Washington
      Whitman $3,000, which he sent in installments of $200 per month (see Jeff's  letter to Walt Whitman, n. 1). In
      his  letter to Walt, Jeff wrote that
      he would "try and send George some money to-day."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n1">5. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to May 1, 1869.
      The connection between Lane and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, who had served
      under Lane before accepting the position of Chief Engineer at the St. Louis
      Water Works, led to George Washington Whitman's employment as a pipe inspector
      in Brooklyn. Lane later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and
      served there as city engineer. George relied on Lane to deposit large checks
      from Jeff, which Lane then withdrew for George as cash (see Jeff's  letter to George).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00578_n2">6. George Washington Whitman
      started his speculative building business with a partner known only as Smith in
      1865, and they were joined by a mason named French the following year. See
      Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n16">7. Walt Whitman often enclosed
      a few dollars (up to five) in each postal service letter to his mother, but he
      transmitted larger amounts by money order. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman reported
      using money orders from Walt to purchase a hair cloth lounge and to pay a debt
      of $10 to her grocer Amerman for a barrel of flour (see her  and her  letters to Walt). Another money order
      from Walt paid for the purchase of coal and the repair of a heating stove (see
      her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n15">8. From March 25 to April 7,
      three "Spring Openings" reviews in the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em> described new fashions in bonnets and hats. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's description, however, is not from an advertisement but from a
      satirical writer under the pseudonym Corry O'Lanus: the "sweetest love of a
      bonnet we saw consisted of two yards of ribbon attached to a rose bud" ("Corry
      O'Lanus' Epistle," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 27, 1869,
      2). The new spring fashion in hats, which drew Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's ire,
      were smaller sizes with low crowns and narrow rims: feathers were out, lace and
      flowers and ribbons were in, and the height of fashion for trimmings was striped
      or "Roman" ribbon in "very pretty colors and tasteful contrasts" ("The
      Fashions," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, March 27, 1869,
      2).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n13">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      most recent visit to her daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde and husband Charles L.
      Heyde in Burlington, Vermont was from early September to mid-October
      1865.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n17">10. When Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman lived at Portland Avenue, the house she shared with Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman and family, a section of the
      house was rented to the family of John Brown, a tailor, in March 1860. The
      relationship between the Browns and the Whitmans was often strained, especially
      in regard to the noise made by Jeff and Mattie's daughter Manahatta, but the
      Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house for five years. For Jeff's
      frustration with the Brown family, see his  and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Though Louisa too expressed annoyance with the Browns, she seems to
      have achieved more cordial relations with the family after the departure of
      Jeff, Mattie, and family to St. Louis in 1868.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n12">11. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Late in 1868 Hannah suffered a
      thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance her wrist in November
      and to amputate her thumb the following month. For Louisa's report on the
      initial surgery from a non-extant letter by Charles Heyde, see her  letter to Walt
      Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n3">12. Samuel Booth
      (1818–1894) was appointed to the office of postmaster by President Ulysses
      S. Grant ("The Post Office," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, April
      14, 1869, 2). Booth was Brooklyn's former mayor, elected to that office in 1865
      ("Obituary," <em>New York Times</em>, October 20, 1894, 4).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n4">13. Margret Steers, her husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
      his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
      death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
      Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
      you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
      1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see
      Mattie Whitman's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; "Died,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>. New York, Brooklyn Ward 7,
      Kings, District 1; and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00579_n21">14. May 1, when leases expired,
      was moving day in Brooklyn. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman moved from 1149 Atlantic
      Avenue to 71 Portland Avenue "opposite the Arsenal" (see her  letter to Walt Whitman).
      George Whitman's progress on the house to which she would move is described
      above.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">15. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r15">[back]
