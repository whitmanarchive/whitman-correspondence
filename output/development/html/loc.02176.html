   </p>
   
   <p>I felt my Book<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> would not be complete with out at least one or two of your letters and
      though I have some 30 or 40 to myself &amp; mother hardly any of them are suitable
      (for one reason or another) for publication. I therefore asked W M Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r2">2</a></sup> if he (on reading my M.S.S.)
      could look out two of your most characteristic letters: he has kindly done so; [
      <span class="unclear">sending?</span>]
       me last night one written by you Dec: '77 about  W.R.'s <u>Selection</u>,<sup><a href="#loc.02176_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> in which you speak against an expurgated editon
      etc: 
   </p>
   
   <p>Rossetti speaks of it as "an uncommonly good letter." And I indeed, think it
      [
      <span class="unclear">manly?</span>]
       and
      characteristic and also a letter of considerable literary interest, one that will
      help the readers to understand you; hence, I shall [
      <span class="unclear">venture?</span>]
       to print it in my <u>Book</u>, unless I have a letter or telegram to the contrary from you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What I wrote about Dr. B.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> sings discordantly in my ears—but in truth I was and
      am angry at his cool request to hand over your letters (&amp; mothers) to him: his
      <u>injudicious</u> literary zeal does you and every body else harm  however, I will
      say no more on this head. 
   </p>
   
   <p>My M.S. has been cast &amp; makes 430 pages! </p>
   
   <p>I am very busy </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter

      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02178_n1">1. <em>Anne
         Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em> would be published in 1887 with a
      foreword by William Michael Rossetti.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">2. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02176_n1">3. Gilchrist is referring to
      the volume: <em>Poems of Walt Whitman</em>, ed. William Michael
      Rossetti (London: John Camden Hotten, 1868).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
