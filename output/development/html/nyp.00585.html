   <p>I am ab't as usual in health—<em>minus</em> perhaps a little, as
      the heat of the weather here is great &amp; a little premature—But I am

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information

      Ernest Rhys | Care Walter Scott Co: | Publishers | 24 Warwick Lane-Paternoster |
      Row | London England. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | May 25 | 6 PM | 87;

   <p id="nyp.00585_n2">2. On May 6, 1887, William
      T. Stead, editor of the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em>, printed an
      excerpt from a private correspondent (probably Moncure D. Conway) alleging that
      Americans were not as generous as they should be in their gifts to Walt Whitman.
      Herbert Gilchrist, the son of Anne Gilchrist and an artist of sorts, arrived in
      New York on May 27, and appeared in Camden on June 3. For the next several
      months Gilchrist worked on the portrait now in the Rare Book Department of the
      University of Pennsylvania. It is reproduced in Harold W. Blodget and Sculley
      Bradley, eds., <em>Comprehensive Reader's Edition</em> (New York:
      New York University Press, 1965) and in Edwin Haviland Miller, <em>The Artistic Legacy of Walt Whitman </em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1970), figure 25. For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0615">3. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
