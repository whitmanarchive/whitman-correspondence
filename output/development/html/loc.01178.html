   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was very glad to get your card, but sorry to hear you are under the weather. I
      trust the spring which is now near will set you up again. I keep pretty well, as do
      wife<sup><a href="#n0892" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Julian<sup><a href="#loc.01151_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>. We have been
      here all winter. I have been busy with my pen, turning out
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>pot-boilers, nothing else[.] I shall keep an eye out for your <u>N.A.</u> article. I see it in the reading rooms in 
      PoKeepsie
      
      . I have been sending some things to the <u>Independent</u> &amp; to the <u>Christian Union</u> at the
      request of the editors. It is surprising how much heresy these papers can stand. I
      think they secretly like it. I see nothing in the literary horizon, no coming poet
      or philosopher[.] My opinion is that life is
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>becoming pretty thin. Once civilization runs all to head &amp; cuteness, no
      character, no heart in anything 
      now adays
      
       most of the magazine poetry is utterly barren. It is like poor
      mortar—too much sand for the lime.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am in a hurry to see spring. I want to taste the earth again. The ground here has
      been deeply covered since early in Dec. Rain &amp; fog today.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
