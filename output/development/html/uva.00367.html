      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose you an article from the <em>Nation</em> of Jan. 29. How will the MS. article I have scratched off, 
      do, in the main, as an answer to it? (to help keep the pot a-boiling.) Do you feel
      like 
      making up an article out of said MS—adding or excising what you see fit—signing your
      name to it—&amp; sending to Mr. Nation man?<sup><a href="#uva.00367_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>

   <p id="uva.00367_n1">1. This letter's envelope bears the address,
      "John Burroughs, | Wallkill Bank | Middletown | New York." It is postmarked,
      "Camden | Feb | 14 | N.J."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="uva.00367_n2">2. In a review of Joaquin Miller's <em>Songs of the Sunlands</em> in the <em>Nation</em> on January 29, 1874, an anonymous writer sharply criticized
      Walt Whitman's catalogs, mystic raptures, and lack of restraint. On , Whitman sent a manuscript entitled "Is
      Walt Whitman's Poetry Poetical?" to John Burroughs, who was to send it to the
      editor of the magazine. If Burroughs submitted the essay, it was not published.
      It is reprinted in Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931),
      107–110.<a href="#r2">[back]
