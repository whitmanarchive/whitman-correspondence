      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend:      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been thinking very often of you lately, and wishing that something might be
      done to lighten life for you. The nation is deeply in your debt for the services you
      rendered in the war, not to mention its deeper debt to you as a poet which will be
      appreciated more and more as the years go on. Hon. Henry B. Lovering,<sup><a href="#n4250" id="r1">1</a></sup> the Member of
      Congress from my district, 6th Massachusetts, and influential member of committee
      on invalid pensions, tells me that you are fully entitled to a pension and that he
      will be very glad to be
      instrumental in securing it, as he has a high appreciation for you. He would not
      like to do it, however, without consulting your wishes in the matter, and therefore
      I write to ask if I may not tell him to go ahead. The act would be purely voluntary
      on the part of Congress, and not in response to any petition from you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Some of us, friends of yours here, are proposing to organize, on a broad and simple
      basis, a Whitman Society, to promote an interest in and study of your works. I
      believe it may accomplish much good. I have seen Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      several times lately, and hope his work on you will secure a good publisher. Have
      also seen Boyle O'Reilly,<sup><a href="#n4973" id="r3">3</a></sup> Bartlett,<sup><a href="#n4959" id="r4">4</a></sup> Arlo
      Bates,<sup><a href="#n4251" id="r5">5</a></sup> Dr. Wesselhaeft<sup><a href="#n3142" id="r6">6</a></sup> and Mrs.
      Fairchild<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>, all staunch friends of yours.
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you know that we have a town called Whitman in Massachusetts now. It was formerly
      South Abington, and its name was changed last winter. It is in the Old Colony, the
      part of the
      country where your first American ancestors lived. I do not know for whom it was
      named, but to many it will recall the most eminent member of the family.
   </p>
   
   <p>In the December number of <u>The Path</u>, a magazine published in
      New York, is one of a series of articles on "Poetical Occultism."<sup><a href="#loc.06008_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> This one is devoted to some of your poems and is partly
      written by me, partly by my friend W. Q. Judge.<sup><a href="#n4253" id="r9">9</a></sup> I will have a copy sent you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4250">1. Henry Bacon Lovering
      (1841–1911) held several political positions at state and federal levels.
      Lovering represented Massachusetts' sixth district in the U.S. House of
      Representatives between 1883 and 1887, and was appointed as the United States
      Marshal for Massachusetts by President Grover Cleveland in 1888. He later served
      as the United States Pension Agent at Boston between 1894 and 1898. Lovering was
      involved in efforts to get Whitman a government pension in recognition of his
      Civil War hospital service.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4973">3. John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). For more on O'Reilly, see
      also the letter from Whitman to James R. Osgood of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4959">4. Truman Howe Bartlett
      (1835–1923), an instructor in modelling at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology, was characterized by William Vaughan Moody as "a magnificent old
      goat and man of God . . . passing hours with immortal phrases"; see Hermann
      Hagedorn, <em>Edwin Arlington Robinson</em> (New York: Macmillan,
      1938), 254. Bartlett evidently affected the Whitman pose with his open collar
      and flowing tie. On , Bartlett
      informed Whitman that "the cast of your hand I shall soon send to Paris to be
      cast in bronze." The plaster cast is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; a bronze cast is at Yale. Probably
      Whitman met Bartlett at the poet's close friend Colonel John R. Johnston's home
      on September 1, 1878 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4251">5. Arlo Bates (1850–1918) was an
      American author of several novels, poetry collections, and essays on literary
      criticism. He served as the editor for the <em>Boston Sunday
         Courier</em> between 1880 and 1893, and afterward was appointed as Professor
      of English at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3142">6. William P. Wesselhoeft
      (1835–1909) was a homeopathic doctor from Pennsylvania and the son of the
      famous William Wilhelm Wesselhoeft, one of the most prominent proponents of
      Hahnemannian medicine in the United States.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="har.00049_n3">7. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.06008_n1">8. "Poetical Occultism: Some
      Rough Studies of the Occult Leanings of the POets, III," by "J." and "S.B.," was
      published in <em>The Path</em> 1 (December 1886), 270–74; it
      explained how Whitman's work exemplified doctrines of meditation, karma, and
      reincarnation.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4253">9. William Quan Judge
      (1851–1896) was an Irish-born lawyer, mystic, occultist, and a founding
      member of the New York Theosophical Society in 1875. After traveling to India
      with co-founder Helena Petrovna Blavatsky to promote his esoteric philosophies,
      and having made enemies among the Christian missionaries there, he returned to
      New York in 1885 to revitalize Theosophy in the United States through numerous
      essays and monographs.<a href="#r9">[back]
