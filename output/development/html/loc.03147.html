      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> "That my soul embraces you this hour, and we affect each other without ever seeing
      each other, and never perhaps to see each other, is every bit as wonderful" and that
      I can think such thoughts as these is just as wonderful, and that I can remind you,
      and you think them and know them to be true is just as wonderful." Indeed there is
      very little in Leaves of Grass but what I know to be true. It is some more than two
      years since I first read your book, and sometimes I have felt so in 
      raport
      
       with your feelings therein expressed that I have written you 
      dozzens
      
       of letters, and I have no doubt you would have got them, had they been
      done on paper, or any material 
      transmittible.
      
        I
      presume I have read "The Open Road" twenty times or more. Last fall I was staying
      over two months—with Mrs Dr. Severance of Milwaukee. I read it to
      her—and one evening she asked me to read it again, her husband being with us,
      for she said I read it as 
      tho
      
       I understood it. Yes, and how "utterly quelled and defeated" too I have
      felt to find my strength <u>so much less</u> than my impulses.
      The poem "To You" has been worth wonders to me, so inclined am I to self reproach.
      Your "Song of Myself" I have read over and over again. No poems ever gave me so
      confident a hope in a continued existence. If only "the lover for whom <u>I</u> pine will be there"! How I long to find them here! and
      do—scattered everywhere, and their very existence makes me long for them. All
      around me I see "Of each one the core of life, namely happiness, is full of the
      rotten excrement of maggots," and so in my loneliness when I try to be happy with
      them all that is <u>true</u> to me  comes up plainer. The effort seems
      to be—honestly no doubt—to conceal "our real names". 
   </p>
   
   <p> When I read "You Felons on trial in Courts" The tears flow like rain, and I think
      how 
      develish
      
       I have been to day. I feel imprisoned—I am tied here— but ever
      hopeful of a release. We have large pleasant grounds—and houseroom enough, but
      the provider and "head of the house" seems ever determined that we shall realize our
      dependent positions. How easy it is to discover and acknowledge our superiors, but
      when any person uses a <u>domineering</u> superiority over you,
      <u>
         resistence
         
         </u> seems but natural, and so I hate the one I would gladly love.
      Hate is to the hater and comes back most to him; 
      
   </p>
   
   <p> June 26th 
      In our manner of living we are hygienists but yesterday we had company for dinner
      and so to be sociable after the manner of Col. Ingessol, I drank a cup of coffee.
      I
      am a good sleeper naturally but that cup of coffee never lost its hold of me until
      way after midnight. Leaves  of Grass laid on my lightstand, and I opened to "Song of the
      Universe." I read it in a new light. It seemed to me the poetry of SP Andrew's late
      prophetic lecture before Manhattan Liberal Club. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I had already marked next to last verse, Oh! how fast the world moves to me when
      I
      read such thoughts, and how slow when I carry them with me among my neighbors. If
      you have not read S.P.A.'s may I send the paper to you?
