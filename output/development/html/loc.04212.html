      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You could not easily realize the strong emotion with which I read your last note and
      traced on the little map<sup><a href="#loc.31103_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—a most precious possession which I would not part with for the whole world—all your
      journeyings—both in youth &amp; now. Mingled emotions! for I cannot but feel anxious about
      your health, &amp; if I didn't know it was very naught to ask you questions, should beg
      you [to] tell me in what way your health has failed—whether it is the rheumatic &amp;
      neuralgic affection that troubled you the last spring we were in Philadelphia, or
      whether the fatigues &amp; excitements &amp; the very enjoyments &amp; full life, &amp; burst of prophetic
      joy, as it were, had proved too great a strain. But you have accomplished another
      thing, that had to be done in your life &amp; I exult with you—have seen the vast magnificent
      theatre, the free, unfettered conditions whereon humanity will enact a new drama,
      with the parts all so differently cast! the rest—the moving spirit of it all—hints
      of this, at least—flashes, glimpses, I find in your greatest poems. But, dear Friend,
      I think humanity moves forward [slowly] even under splendid conditions—you must give
      it a century or two instead of 50 years—before at least the crowning glories of a
      corresponding literature &amp; art will develope themselves—Nature has got plenty of time
      before her, &amp; obstinately refuses to be hurried; witness her dealings with the mere
      rocks &amp; stones.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Bee<sup><a href="#n0260" id="r3">3</a></sup> is at Berne, working away merrily, rejoicing in the really splendid advantage for
      medical study there open to her. She mastered German so as to be able to speak &amp; understand
      it—lectures &amp; all—with ease during the two months at Wiesbaden &amp; she has found a thoroughly
      comfortable home with some excellent, intelligent ladies who are fond of her &amp; see
      to her bodily welfare in every possible way. I have my dear little grandson with me
      here—as engaging a little toddler as the sun ever shone upon—so affectionate &amp; sweet-tempered
      &amp; bright. I wish I could see him sitting on your knee. You will certainly have to
      come to us as soon as ever we have a comfortable home, won't you? Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r4">4</a></sup> is well &amp; as rosy as ever. She &amp; Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r5">5</a></sup> send their love. I have seen Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r6">6</a></sup>—he was full of enquiries &amp; affectionate interest in all that concerns you—&amp; loth
      we were to break off our conversation &amp; hurry back—but Hampstead, the pleasantest
      &amp; prettiest of all our suburbs, is terribly inaccessible &amp; cuts us off a good deal
      from the intercourse with old friends I had looked forward to. It is on the top of
      a high hill (as high as the top of St. Pauls), &amp; looks down on one side over the great
      city with its canopy of smoke, &amp; on the other over a wide, pleasant stretch of green
      &amp; fertile Middlesex—has moreover pleasant lanes, solid old houses, shaded by big elms,
      &amp; other picturesque features &amp; such an abundance of keen, fresh air this cold weather
      too! We sigh for the warmth of an American house indoors often &amp; for American sunshine
      out of doors. Rossetti has a beautiful little group of children growing up around
      him—I think the eldest girl will grow up a real beauty &amp; the boy too is a noble little
      fellow. I meet numbers so delighted to hear about you. I believe Addington Symonds<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r7">7</a></sup> is preparing a book which treats largely of your Poems.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Glad to hear that Brother &amp; Sister &amp; nieces are all well. I wish I could write to
      some of them, but what with needlework, an avalanche of letters, the care of my dear
      little man—the re-editing of my husband's life of Blake,<sup><a href="#loc.04045_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup> to which there will be a considerable addition of letters newly come to light, I
      hardly know which way to turn. Per.<sup><a href="#n2000" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; my nephew &amp; the "Process" have made a great stride forward. Won two important law
      suits at Berlin, where the Bessemer ring &amp; Krupp at their head were trying to oust
      them of their patent rights. Also it is practically making good way in England. So
      by &amp; bye the money will begin to flow in, I suppose—but has not done so yet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I trust, dearest Friend, this will find you safe &amp; fairly well again at Camden, with
      plenty of great, happy thoughts to brood over for the winter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Love from us all. Good-bye.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

         and Writings</em> (London: T.F. Unwin, 1887).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0260">3. Beatrice Carwardine Gilchrist (1854–1881) was
      the second child (and first daughter) of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. An
      aspiring physician, Beatrice took the needed preparatory classes but was barred
      (as were all women) from becoming a medical student in England. As a result, she
      attended the Women's Medical College in Philadelphia. She held positions as a
      physician in Berne, Switzerland, and later Edinburgh before committing suicide
      by fatally ingesting hydrocyanic acid in 1881.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">4. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">5. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">6. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0615">7. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.04045_n2">8. Presumably the new and
      enlarged two-volume edition, <em>Life of William Blake, with
         Selections</em> (1880), containing the memoir of Herbert's father, Alexander
      Gilchrist.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2000">9. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist
      (1851–1935) was a British chemist and metallurgist, and the son of
      Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. Along with his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, he
      developed the Thomas-Gilchrist process of producing steel from phosphoric pig
      iron during the late 1870s. See Marion Walker Alcaro, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.:
      Associated University Presses, 1991), 252 n28.<a href="#r9">[back]
