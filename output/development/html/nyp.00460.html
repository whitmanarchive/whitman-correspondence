   <p id="nyp.00460_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd July 13/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Jul | 11 | 4 PM | (?);
      Washington, D. C. | Jul | 12 | 5 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00460_n2">2. William O'Connor
      carefully explained on July 10 that he had given a slightly misleading
      impression of the Post Office's decision since the ruling applied only to George
      Chainey's pamphlet, not to <em>Leaves of Grass</em> as a book.
      However, the interpretation offered by Judge Charles A. Ray, the law officer of
      the Post Office Department, meant in effect that <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> was "<em>mailable</em>" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
