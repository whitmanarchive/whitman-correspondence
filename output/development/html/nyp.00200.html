      <br></br><br></br>My dear Nelly,
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sit down home here in the front basement alone to write you a few lines. Mother
      is still at Burlington,<sup><a href="#nyp.00200_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I am waiting to hear from her, what she decides, about coming home—I shall probably
      go for her very shortly. I find it makes a mighty difference in my visit—(What is
      home without—&amp;c)—
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear little California is sick—infantile remittent fever—for the past week has
      just been lying quiet &amp; pale, eats literally nothing—it is pitiful, &amp; throws a gloom
      over every thing—doctor comes every day, &amp; sometimes twice a day—when I ask him about
      the chances, he is rather noncommittal—saying the disease in such a case as hers is
      expected to run fourteen days, before a turn for either better or worse—the fourteen
      days are up next Sunday—meanwhile she grows weaker &amp; weaker—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am middling well—My brother George has resumed carpentering<sup><a href="#nyp.00200_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he is well, &amp; looks fine—I see him every day—the rest of the folks all well. I send
      my love to Charles Eldridge—same to Ashton—when you write tell me the latest from
      the baby &amp; Mrs. Ashton. Send William the enclosed piece<sup><a href="#nyp.00200_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup>—it is one of those I spoke of—When you write direct to me, <em>Portland av. near Myrtle</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00200_n100" id="r5">5</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were
      to be his close associates during the early Washington years. William D.
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>,
      an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
      O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In
      1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William over the Fifteenth
      Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended
      Whitman's opinion, and in response William established a separate residence. The
      correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00200_n2">1. Whitman must have arrived
      in Brooklyn early in October for "a month's furlough" (see Whitman's letter from
      
      ), and evidently
      returned to Washington on November 7 (see Whitman's letter from 
      ). He went to Brooklyn in
      order to supervise the binding of <em>Sequel to Drum-Taps</em>,
      which was printed in Washington; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman</em> (New York:
      Macmillan, 1955; rev. ed., New York University Press, 1967), 353.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00200_n4">2. Mrs. Whitman arrived in
      Burlington, Vermont, on September 5, 1865. She wrote to Whitman on that date, as
      well as on September 11, 21, and 27 (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). She "found
      hanna quite as well and better than i expected." Mrs. Whitman returned on
      October 16 (see Whitman's letter of 
      ). On , Thomas Jefferson Whitman had
      described a long letter which Heyde had written to his mother: "He says he shall
      leave Han, and go out west—I wish he was in Hell—Mother of course is
      considerably exercised about it—and thinks she will go on there and bring Han
      home."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00200_n5">3. After toying with several
      offers, including an appointment in the New York Custom House, George Washington
      Whitman decided to return to housebuilding. "I am quite sure," Jeff wrote to
      Walt Whitman on , "that if he
      can keep devoted to his present undertaking he will make a handsome fortune in 8
      or ten years—he certainly has the prospect of it." George had been mustered out
      in July. Nothing came of his plans to remain a commissioned officer in the
      regular army.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00200_n6">4. Whitman enclosed a review
      of his work from the <em>London Leader</em> of June 30, 1860, for
      William D. O'Connor. O'Connor was so impressed that he planned to incorporate "a
      great deal of it" into his manuscript, <em>The Good Gray Poet</em>
      (13–14), which he was revising when he wrote on : "But oh, Walt, the literary shortcomings of it
      oppress me. It is not the thing that should be said of your book—not the thing
      that it is in even me to say." At this time O'Connor had not found a publisher
      for his polemic.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00200_n100">5. The letter is endorsed,
      "Ans'd." &nbsp;The envelope for this letter bears the address: Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, |
      326 H st. near Vermont av. | Washington, | D. C. &nbsp; Postmark: "New York | Oct |
