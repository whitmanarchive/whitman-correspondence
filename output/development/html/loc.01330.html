      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The papers say you are engaged upon a complete Edition of your Poems. I have been
      an admirer thereof for some six years, and believe myself to have learned from them.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have the Roſsetti Edition, but should like to have the complete one. I enclose a
      money order for £<u>4.180</u> (somewhere about $20), for an early copy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I would send you a volume of poems of my own, but they are very juvenile; and I
      
      
      would rather not be known of by them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Would your health permit you to come to England? My wife &amp; I would both be delighted
      if you could come and stay with us so long as might suit you. I expect in the spring
      we shall be resident a few miles out of
      
      
      London.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With our best regards
      <br></br>yours faithfully
      <br></br>Kenningale Cook.
