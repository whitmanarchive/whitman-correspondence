   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4147">3. Walter Scott was a railway
      contractor and a publisher in London. His publishing firm, Walter Scott, was
      based in London and Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and it was the imprint under which
      Whitman's books appeared in England. Walter Scott's managing editor was
      bookbinder David Gordon, and Ernest Rhys—one of Whitman's major promoters
      in England—worked with the firm. Rhys included a volume of Whitman's poems
      in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's prose in the Camelot
      series for Walter Scott publishers. Walter Scott also published Whitman's 1886
      English edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and the English
      editions of <em>Specimen Days in America</em> (1887) and <em>Democratic Vistas, and Other Papers</em> (1888).<a href="#r3">[back]
