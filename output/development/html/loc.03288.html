   <p>All right my dear J R<sup><a href="#loc.03288_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—$60 for the Booth article will do, in full<sup><a href="#loc.03288_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—(I
      reserve the right of printing it in future collections of my writings—this is
      indispensable.) I have been &amp; am lingering under the miserable inertia following
      my sunstroke—otherwise should have sent you one or two articles—have
      them on the stocks—
   </p>
   
   <p>Am very slowly gaining the tally of my previous strength—had none to spare
      before—
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you, dear friend, for your services &amp; affectionate good will.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03288_n2">1. This draft letter is on the
      back of an envelope from <em>The North American Review</em>
      postmarked NEW YORK | AUG 11 | 730 PM and CAMDEN, N.J. | AUG | 12 | 7 A.M. |
      1885 | REC'D, which presumably contained the letter from James Redpath to
      Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03288_n1">2. On  Redpath, at this time managing editor of
      <em>The North American Review</em>, asked Whitman to send to
      C. Allen Thorndike Rice, the proprietor of the magazine, his reminiscences of
      Abraham Lincoln and also requested an article on "hospital life" during the
      Civil War for Rice's newspaper syndicate, which printed popular articles in the
      Sunday editions of such papers as the New York <em>Tribune</em>
      and the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>. Rice wrote on  to Whitman soliciting contributions for the
      syndicate. Apparently Whitman accepted both proposals in his (lost) letter which
      Redpath received before he wrote on . On
       Redpath informed Whitman that he was
      enclosing "a check for sixty dollars, which is payment for the article according
      to your own estimate of three thousand words, at the rate of twenty dollars a
      thousand, which is the very highest rate they [the syndicate] pay." "Booth and
      'The Bowery'" appeared in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on August
      16. Redpath paid $50 for "Slang in America" on October 20, which appeared in <em>The North American Review</em> in November, 1885.<a href="#r2">[back]
