   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00551_n9">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      dated the letter "wensday," and the letter closes with the news that "grant is
      elected." Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the date November 4, 1868, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:66, n. 17; 2:366). Republican presidential candidate Ulysses S. Grant's strong
      showing in the election on Tuesday, November 3, 1868, assured him an electoral
      college victory, so this letter dates to the Wednesday immediately following the
      election, November 4, 1868.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00551_n4">2. Charles L. Heyde
      (1822–1892), a French-born landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa
      Whitman (1823–1908), Walt's sister, in 1852, and they lived in Burlington,
      Vermont. Hannah in late 1868 suffered from a thumb infection that led Doctor
      Samuel W. Thayer to lance her wrist in November 1868 and to amputate her thumb
      the following month (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; and see Charles L. Heyde's
      December 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.
      Silver, ed., <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of
         Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University
      Press, 1949], 225–226).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00551_n8">4. Mattie Whitman had arrived
      in Brooklyn for a visit and medical evaluation in mid-October. For a report on
      her medical condition, see Walt Whitman's  letter to Thomas Jefferson Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00470_n8">5. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge
      and later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the Washington
      years. William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">"The Good Gray Poet"</a> in 1866. Nelly O'Connor had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman, and the correspondence between Walt and Nelly is
      almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00551_n2">6. Helen "Ellen" Price was the
      daughter of Edmund and Abby Price, whom Walt Whitman and his mother had known
      since the Prices moved to Brooklyn in 1856. During the 1860s, Abby Price and her
      family, especially her daughter Helen, were friends with Walt and Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman. The Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's
      reminiscences of Whitman are included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she
      printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother ("Letters of
      Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's
         Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00551_n11">7. Edmund and Abby Price's
      boarder may have been John Arnold and family (see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955],
      199).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00515_n4">8. Margret Steers, her husband
      Thomas Steers (1826–1869), and their four children Thomas (b. 1853),
      Caroline (b. 1857), Louisa (b. 1862), and Margret (b. 1865) moved into the
      Atlantic Avenue building in November 1868. Thomas Steers operated a bakery, and
      his wife, who would become a close friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      continued the business when he died in January 1869. After Thomas Steers' sudden
      death, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman replied to an early 1869 letter from
      Louisa (not extant) with concern that "Mr. Steers' death had quite an effect on
      you." George Washington Whitman sold a property to Margaret Steers in January
      1871, and the property had title trouble with regard to unpaid assessments (see
      Mattie Whitman's February? 1869 letter to Louisa in Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 67; Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman; "Died,"
      <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, January 22, 1869, 3; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>. New York, Brooklyn Ward 7,
      Kings, District 1; and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00551_n3">9. The 1868 presidential
      election was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1868. By November 4 both the <em>New York Times</em> and the <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em> reported the expected and overwhelming electoral college victory
      of Republican candidate Ulysses S. Grant (1822–1885). Grant was the most
      successful and highest ranking Union general of the Civil War. As commander of
      the Army of the Potomac, he accepted the surrender of Robert E. Lee at
      Appomattox. Elected first in 1868, he was re-elected in 1872 and served two full
      terms as president.<a href="#r9">[back]
