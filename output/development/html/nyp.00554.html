   </p>
   
   <p>I have been quite unwell, or I should have ans'd you sooner. Yours of Nov. 26th, with
      check for Twenty Dollars, ($20) (herewith returned) was duly rec'd—Thank you
      most fervently, my friend—But I don't feel at all like writing a notice or
      biography of Halleck<sup><a href="#nyp.00554_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—(nor indeed capacitated for
      it)—I met H. once in Park Place, N. Y. &amp; remember his looks &amp;
      talk—but I dont think I can write ab't him—Thank you &amp; the Messrs:
      Appleton—Please send me word of the rec't of this—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>General James Grant
      Wilson (see the letter from Whitman to Wilson of ) was the author of <em>Bryant and His Friends</em>
      (1886). In 1888 Whitman said: "I knew Wilson very well—he was a cordial
      and convincing character. . . . Wilson belongs to the conventional literary old
      guard in New York" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.30.html">Monday, August 13, 1888</a>). On , Wilson invited the poet to stay with him during his New York
      visit.

      Halleck (1815–1872) was Grant's chief of staff. This was apparently not
      the type of "pot-boiler" Whitman was willing to write.<a href="#r1">[back]
