      <br></br><br></br>Friend Whitting, Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We received your kind and welcome letter inquiring for my boy Billy and in reply will
      say that Billy is or was getting along first rate when we heard from him last he is
      in Washington employed in hospital as night watch. I write to him to day and send
      him your letter doubtless he will write to you forthwith
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel very much indebted to you for your kindness and greatly honored to answer your
      letter or as many as you may write. Billy come home in July the first of the month
      and stayed till the 10th of November when he went back and got employment. He has
      so far recovered as to able to attend to the duties of night watch he has not got
      the use of his arm fully but will I hope in the course of time Billy is a right good
      boy I believe, you must write again and I will answer with pleasure
   </p>
