      <br></br><br></br>Dear Uncle Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Lew tells me he has just finished writing to you, and I take the opportunity of sending
      a few lines in his letter<sup><a href="#nyp.00170_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>, as a slight token of my affectionate regard for you. I am sorry to hear you have
      been ill; but hope that by this time you have fully recovered; and that we shall soon
      have the pleasure of seeing you in Washington, where you are so much missed by your
      intimate friends and the soldiers in hospitals.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am at present rather unwell;—with a billious attack—but hope to be up again in a day or two.</p>
   
   <p>There was a salute of 100 guns fired here at noon today, in honor of the news from
      Atlanta, which creates quite a Jubilee.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is now quite a shower of rain falling, and Lew and Bartlett are having quite
      a time down stairs<sup><a href="#nyp.00170_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>, while I am up here in our room, alternately throwing up bile, and writing to you.
      Very interesting, is it not? (I mean the <em>bile</em> - ing affair.)
   </p>
   
   <p>If you have time, please write me sometimes, as I will always be very happy even to
      receive a few lines from you.
   </p>

      Very respectfully yours

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00170_n2">1. Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00170_n3">2. Adrian Bartlett was a friend
      of Joseph Harris and Lewis Brown; all three met Whitman while they were being
      treated at Armory Square Hospital. On , Brown reported that he had not seen Bartlett and Harris since
      they returned from a spree to Baltimore on July 4, 1864. According to Brown's
      letter of , the three young men
      were living in a Washington boardinghouse; Harris was not in good health, and
      Bartlett worked in the Treasury Department.<a href="#r2">[back]
