      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have to thank you for many mementoes in the shape of newspapers. One which lately
      reached me, of Dec 27 1888, contains the welcome news that you are recovering from
      your last severe &amp; tedious attack of illness.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> has been my companion during the last week. I have read it
      with the deepest interest, finding the autobiographical passages regarding your early life &amp; the
      development of your great scheme particularly valuable. Rejoicing also in the
      delightful rigour of your critical notes.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now I am eager to get the 900 page volume of your Complete Works,<sup><a href="#n4192" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; do not know
      where it is published. I shall try to obtain it through my London bookseller.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have long wished to write about your views regarding the literature of the future.
      Each time I have attempted to do so, I have quailed before my own inadequacy to
      grapple with the theme. But I have in preparation a collection of essays on
      speculative &amp; critical problems, one of which will be called "Democratic
      Art"<sup><a href="#loc.05127_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; will be based upon your "Democratic
      Vistas"<sup><a href="#n4122" id="r4">4</a></sup> &amp; "Leaves of Grass." This I have been working
      at during the last
      month; &amp; however imperfect it may be, I have contrived to state in it a portion
      of what I think the world owes to you both for your suggestions &amp; for the
      illustrations you have given in your poems—not only by asserting the necessity
      of a new literature adequate to the people &amp; pregnant with the modern scientific
      spirit, but also by projecting &amp; to a large extent realizing that literature in
      your own work.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Meanwhile I am able to echo the words of your friend Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      in his "impromptu criticism,"<sup><a href="#loc.07537_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &amp; to congratulate you now in the autumn of your
      life upon the achievement of a monument "more enduring than brass or marble."
   </p>
   
   <p>Believe me, dear master, to be, though a silent &amp; uncommunicative friend, your
      true respectful &amp; loving disciple
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3999">1. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4192">2. Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> was published in December 1888. With the
      help of Horace Traubel, Whitman made the presswork and binding decisions, and
      Frederick Oldach bound the volume, which included a profile photo of the poet on
      the title page. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r2">[back]

      book, <em>Essays Speculative and Suggestive</em>, Volume 2
      (London: Chapman and Hall, 1890), 30–77.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4122">4. Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> was first published in 1871 in New York by J.S.
      Redfield. The volume was an eighty-four-page pamphlet that consisted of three
      essays titled "Democracy," "Personalism," and "Orbic Literature," all of which
      Whitman intended to publish in the <em>Galaxy</em> magazine. Only
      "Democracy" and "Personalism" appeared in the magazine. For more information on
      <em>Democratic Vistas</em>, see Arthur Wrobel, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_4.html"><em>Democratic Vistas</em> [1871]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07537_n6">6. Bucke had written to Whitman
      on December 20, 1888, registering at length his enthusiasm for Whitman's
      just-published <em>Complete Poems and Prose</em>. Whitman decided
      to have Bucke's letter printed for distribution among his friends and disciples,
      and he titled it "An impromptu criticism on the 900 page Volume, 'The Complete
      Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman,' first issued December, 1888." The first
      printing had several typos, including the addition of an acute accent over the
      first "e" of "Goethe," so Whitman had the errors corrected in a second printing
      that was completed by January 2, 1889. See Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>.<a href="#r6">[back]
