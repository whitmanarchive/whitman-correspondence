   <p>It is more than a week since I heard last from you—I hope you are keeping well.
      I have got a big blank book properly ruled and with printed headings for each page,
      all planned with great pains for a Walt Whitman <u>Bibliography</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.07354_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Commenced working at it
      today—it will take months to complete it (working at it odd times)—I am
      entering in it in proper place and order all writing by or about a certain Walt
      Whitman. I find that what I am shortest in is first editions of poems and prose
      pieces by the said W.W.—I mean as there came out in newspapers and
      magazines—if you have any of these (especially early ones)
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>that you do not especially want to keep I wish you would let me have them. I expect
      the new inspector (Mr Christie)<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup> up here tomorrow or next day.
      He will likely remain a couple of days.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mrs Bucke<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r4">4</a></sup> went to Sarnia yesterday for a short visit. We are all
      well. Are having perfect weather—neither hot nor cold—just right.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How does the O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r5">5</a></sup> "Preface" get on?<sup><a href="#loc.07354_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> I fear it is too hot down your way to do much—had
      a note from Mrs O'C.<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r7">7</a></sup> a few days ago—she seemed to be
      feeling the heat very much.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r8">8</a></sup> here yet. I hope (but scarcely dare expect) to see
      him this week.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Been dipping into Ruskin lately—like him better than I ever did
      before—but he is too hard to please—ordinary modern folk are not to his
      taste—too bad!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07354_n2">2. Bucke's bibliography of
      Whitman was never published, and the manuscript does not appear to be extant.
      Whitman agreed to send Bucke the items he requested. In his letter of , Whitman write that he "will send you
      anything I find or think of in that line."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4273">4. Jessie Maria Gurd (1839–1926)
      grew up in Mooretown, Upper Canada. She was the daughter of William Gurd, an 
      army officer from Ireland. Jessie married Richard Maurice Bucke in 1865. The couple
      had eight children.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n2002">5. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4137">7. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

   <p id="n4284">8. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
