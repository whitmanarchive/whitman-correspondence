      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was much obliged to you for the kind thought of sending me your fine verses on the
      Parisian catastrophes. My own sympathy (far unlike that of most
      Englishmen) was very strongly with the Commune—i.e. with extreme, democratic,
      &amp; progressive republicanism, against a semi–republicanism 
      wh.
      
       may at any moment (&amp; <u>will</u>, if the ultras don't make
      the attempt too dangerous) degenerate into some form of monarchy exhibiting more or
      less the accustomed cretinism.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I fancy that, unless 
      some one
      
       sends it you from here, you may probably not see an article on your
      position as a poet lately published in the Westminster Review. I therefore take the
      liberty of posting this article to you. I don't know who has written it: but incline
      to think the writer must be Edward Dowden, Professor of English
      Literature in Trinity College,  Dublin—a young man no doubt has a good literary career
      before him. He is at any rate, I know, one of your most earnest admirers. Lately he
      delivered at the College a lecture on your poems, with much applause I am told:
      &amp; the same week some one else in Dublin delivered another like lecture. There
      are various highly respectful references also to your poetry in a work of some
      repute recently published here, "Our Living Poets," by
      Forman (dealing directly with <u>English</u> poets only).
   </p>
   
   <p>You may perhaps be aware  that the Westminster Review is a quarterly, forwarded by Jeremy Bentham, &amp; to this day continuing to be the most advanced of the
      English reviews as regards liberal politics &amp; speculation.
   </p>
   
   <p>I trust Mr. O'Connor is well: 
      wd.
      
       you please to remember me to him if opportunity offers.
   </p>
   
   <p>Believe me with reverence &amp; gratitude.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
