      <br></br><br></br>[Dear Brother Walt,]
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As I was abt putting these in the envelope my eye caught this blank place and I thought that 'twas
      a pity to let such an opportunity go. It looked like waste.<sup><a href="#loc.00408_n10" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Walt, how I should like to see you, do you look the same as ever or has the immense
      number of unfortunate and heartworking cases given you an sobre and melancholy look.<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I sometimes think, when I get thinking abt you, that it must have that effect upon you. But then the cases that you releive and those dear lives that you save must bring back the old look again. Do you suppose
      that you will long continue where you are? Do you think Anything will come of your
      trying to get office?<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> I suppose it is merely a question of time and patience as regards the office. I am
      in hopes to be able to have a small some of money sent you every week hereafter in
      this way &nbsp;I will ask Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> to see how many names of those around in and abt. the W. W.<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> will consent to give $1 per month regularly to be sent to you for Hospital purposes.
      I have no doubt but that some 25 or 30 names could be had and if we could send you
      $6 or $7 weekly twould be quite a big thing. We think then that we shall call you "The B. Water Works soldiers
      Aid society" with power. Seriously, I think twould be a good thing and that I can come [by] it. I sent you $5 last week, did you get
      it. Twas from Mr Lane.
   </p>
   
   <p>Twould make you laugh to see little Hattie brush her hair and teeth. I am almost afraid
      she will clean them to death. She is tremendious proud of her things that Uncle Walt sent her. Twould please you to see how finely she is growing. Every day I give her a little exercise
      in singing two or three notes only. I think she could be made a fine musician and
      am going to try it.<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup> She often asks when you are coming home to take her out on Fort Greene.<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n7" id="r8">8</a></sup> She often gets one of you[r] pictures and calls it her dear Uncle Walt. She knew
      Georges picture at once, which I think proves it to be pretty good. Mattie is as well
      as usual, she has no work and has not had hardly since you went away, and I am glad
      she has not<sup><a href="#loc.00406_n8" id="r9">9</a></sup> &nbsp;Mother is first rate except she works to hard &nbsp;I wish she wouldnt &nbsp;she is foolish to clean house so much. Walt do write me a good long letter

      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="loc.00406_n2">3. On , Walt Whitman assured Jeff that he
      was "as much of a beauty as ever…well, not only as much, but more so—I believe I
      weigh about 200 and as to my face, (so scarlet,) and my beard and neck, they are
      terrible to behold…like a great wild buffalo, with much hair."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.00406_n4">5. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.00406_n6">7. On , in a letter which also provided
      Andrew with detailed advice on how he should care for his throat, Walt Whitman
      instructed Jeff as well: "Jeff must not make his lessons to her in music any
      ways strong or frequent on any account—two lessons a week, of ten minutes each,
      is enough—But then I dare say Jeff will think of all these thigs, just the same
      as I am saying."<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.00406_n7">8. Fort Greene stood
      opposite the Whitman's Portland Avenue home. Whitman believed that one of his
      two finest achievements as a journalist was "the securing to public use of
      Washington Park (Old Fort Greene,)…against heavy odds, during an editorship of
      the Brooklyn Eagle" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      3:386). For one of Walt Whitman's editorials on the subject, see <em>The Gathering of the Forces</em>, ed. Cleveland Rogers and

   <p id="loc.00406_n9">10. Isaac Van Anden was the
      publisher and proprietor of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>.
      Walt Whitman edited this paper (March 1846–January 1848) until he
      quarreled with Van Anden over political issues. For more on Van Anden see
