      <br></br><br></br>My Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Are you never coming?<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r1">1</a></sup> I do long &amp; long to see you. I am beginning to like New York better than I did and
      to have pleasant times. Had some friendly chats with Kate Hillard<sup><a href="#n0302" id="r2">2</a></sup> last week, &amp; went with her to call on Mrs. Putman Jacobi,<sup><a href="#n1508" id="r3">3</a></sup> who has a little baby 3 weeks old &amp; is still in her room, but has got through very
      nicely—She talks well, doesn't she? &amp; has a face with plenty of individuality in it.
      Also we went together on Saturday again to one of Miss Booth's<sup><a href="#n3017" id="r4">4</a></sup> receptions, &amp; there met Mrs. Croly,<sup><a href="#n1507" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; had the best talk about you I have had this long while. I like her cordiality—we
      are going to her reception on Sunday &amp; to one at Mrs. Bigelow's<sup><a href="#n1509" id="r6">6</a></sup> Wednesday. It is true there is not much that can be called social enjoyment at these
      crowded receptions, but they enable you to start many acquaintanceships, some of which
      turn out lasting good. We had some fine harp playing &amp; a witty recital at Miss Booth's.
      Miss Selous is back in America. I should not wonder if she comes on here soon. Bee<sup><a href="#n1512" id="r7">7</a></sup> is living at the Dispensary now, instead of in the Hospital, &amp; finds the comparatively
      outdoor life—&amp; the freedom from being "whistled" for all hours of the day and night
      as she was there—a wonderful refreshment. That coloured lady, Mrs. Wiley, whom you
      met once at our house, is her fellow labourer &amp; room mate at the Dispensary. Bee likes
      her much. I am not sure whether you know the Gilders?<sup><a href="#n1034" id="r8">8</a></sup> We spent a couple of hours delightfully with them yesterday afternoon. She has a
      very attractive face, a musical voice, &amp; such a sweet smile. They are going to Europe
      for a four months' holiday this spring. I admire the simple, unconventional way in
      which they live. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r9">9</a></sup> is working away in the best spirits. He is going to paint that bowling alley subject
      on a large scale. Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r10">10</a></sup> is sitting by me with her nose in the French Dictionary, working away at a novel
      of Balzac's. I have had scarcely any letters from England lately!—and the papers bring
      none but dismal tidings; nevertheless I don't believe our sun is going down yet awhile—we
      shall emerge from this dark crisis the better, not the worse, because compelled to
      grapple with the evils that have caused it, instead of passively enduring them. Please
      give friendly remembrance from me to your brothers &amp; sister. Have you been at Kirkwood
      lately, I wonder? I suppose Timber Creek is frozen over. Good-bye, dear Friend. Write
      soon, or better still Come!
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0302">2. Katharine Hillard (1839?–1915) was the translator of
      Dante's <em>Banquet</em> (1889) and the editor of <em>An Abridgment by Katharine Hillard of the Secret Doctrine: A
         Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy by Helena Petrovna
         Blavatsky</em> (1907). A Brooklyn resident, she was a friend of Abby Price
      (see Whitman's , letter to
      Price); in fact, according to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Helen Price
      on November 26, 1872, the Prices expected that Arthur Price and Katharine
      Hillard would marry (Pierpont Morgan Library). Whitman had known Hillard's
      writings since 1871 and mentioned her in his , letter to Charles Eldridge. He sent her a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> on July 27, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book). Writing to Whitman on ,
      Moncure D. Conway quoted from a letter sent to him by Katharine Hillard: "I have
      made a discovery since I have been here [in the Adirondacks], and that is, that
      I never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I
      enjoyed it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only
      one who can reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and
      continue beyond" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914], 3:112). The first meeting of the poetess with Whitman took
      place on February 28, 1876.<a href="#r2">[back]

      Medical College of Philadelphia in March 1878, Beatrice Gilchrist became an
      intern at the New England Hospital for Women and Children in Boston. Her
      twelve-month internship required her to spend three months at the outpatient
      dispensary. See <em>Walt Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne
         Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.: Associated University Presses, 1991),
