      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Although I know Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00412_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> intends to write you to-day and send you a little money yet I thought I would jot
      you a note. My main object is to ask you if you can possibly hear anything of Lane's
      nephew (or boy as he calls him) as he has always been with him and Lane loves him
      like a son) &nbsp;He belongs to the 20th Conn. and was in the 12th Army Corps under Gen
      Birney<sup><a href="#loc.00412_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;The letter of his Company I forget but think it was K. Lane is quite cast down about
      him, mostly from not hearing from him at all. The boys name is "Horace G. Tarr."<sup><a href="#loc.00412_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Walt, if you should by any chance or inquiry come across him or any news from
      him wont you please write Lane for I feel real sorry to see him so cast down. I see
      by some of the papers that quite a number of the 20th Conn. are at Washington in hospital
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel thankful indeed that George did not have to go through the dangers of this
      battle although we know not what is in store for him where he is.<sup><a href="#loc.00412_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I do so hope he will be spared to us and that he will come home without ever being
      injired.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Everything is moving the same as usual at home &nbsp;of course we all feel pretty well
      down-hearted at the news but then we try to look on it in the most favorable light.
      God only knows what will be the next. I had certainly made up my mind that we should
      meet with partial success certainly, but it seems otherwise<sup><a href="#loc.00412_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you are overcrowded with work just now &nbsp;I cannot see Walt how you can stand
      it. I am sure that I could never get used to all the scenes of pain and horror that
      you have to witness &nbsp;Tis well though that you can do so, for I know that you are doing
      a great deal of good.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you do not have much time to write home &nbsp;We do not hear from you but seldom
      now. I suppose however that as long as we dont hear, everything is going as usual with you. We have not heard from either Han or
      George since I last wrote you &nbsp;I am getting along first rate just now, make quite
      a little money and every thing goes well &nbsp;Mother and Mat and Sis and all are well
      and send love. Write me Walt

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00412_n1">1. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff, he collected money from his employees and
      friends to give to Walt's hospital efforts during the Civil War. In his letter
      of , Lane pledged $5 each month.
      Similarly, Lane sent dollar contributions from six individuals on . In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Berg Collection, Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed
      quite a large sum of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in
      Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works
      there.)" Lane also assisted Whitman in other ways. He was so solicitous of
      Whitman's personal welfare that on ,
      he sent through Jeff $5 "for your own especial benefit."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00412_n2">2. Jeff seems to be in
      error here. Major General David Bell Birney (1825-64) commanded divisions at
      Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, both places where the Twentieth Connecticut
      Volunteers fought, but he never commanded in the Twelfth Army Corps. At this
      time he commanded the First Division, Third Army Corps, Army of the Potomac,
      while the Twentieth Connecticut Volunteers was in the Twelfth Army Corps, Second
      Brigade, First Division, under the command of Colonel Samuel Ross
      (1820?-80).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00412_n3">3. Horace G. H. Tarr
      (1844-?) had just been promoted from private to sergeant major of Company K. His
      regiment fought at Chancellorsville, Virginia, May 1-5, 1863, but he was not
      injured. Evidently Tarr became a lifelong friend of Jeff and Walt Whitman (see
      Jeff's letter to Walt dated ).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00412_n4">4. George was encamped
      near Lexington, Kentucky (Jerome M. Loving, ed., <em>Civil War
         Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University
      Press, 1975], pp. 91-93).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00412_n5">5. Jeff is depressed by
      the results of the Battle of Chancellorsville, where a Union army of 130,000 men
      led by General Joseph Hooker was defeated by General Robert E. Lee's 60,000
      Confederates. For Notherners, the only encouraging news was that Lee sacrificed
      11,000 men—about as many as Hooker lost—and Stonewall Jackson, Lee's superb
      general, was killed.<a href="#r5">[back]
