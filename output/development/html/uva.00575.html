      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>The last time I called on you we had a delightful conversation about books. And
      I would like to repeat this visit, but I know your time is taken up with callers of
      all kinds—and beside conversation while it may be retained in the memory years
      afterward is not like a written letter from an author that we can keep and
      cherish. I have your autograph in both your works but I want you to write me
      your views on the books a young man should be most familiar with, tell me the
      authors that have most delighted and instructed you. I have a few books and in
      them I have a few autograph letters that I preserve by putting carefully in the
      front, that gives them to my eyes an increased value. Now there are some authors
      that I cannot get a scrap of, <u>they are dead</u> I know you
      receive and have received correspondence from Emerson,<sup><a href="#n1044" id="r2">2</a></sup> Carlyle<sup><a href="#n4301" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      &amp; Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r4">4</a></sup>—havent you a bit you would spare me from some
      of these men if it is only a line—as Mark Twain<sup><a href="#uva.00162_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      says—was writ [
      <span class="unclear">wis?</span>]
       his
      own hand. I don't mean those letters you cherish and mean to till you
      die, but I would value them doubly as coming from you—
   </p>

      Yours Respectfully—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Very little is known about
      John R. Witcraft (1858–1936). He lived in Philadelphia and Camden, and he
      compiled and published several family genealogies.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00162_n4">1. The verso of this
      manuscript contains a draft of a poem first published in the <em>New York Herald</em>, March 12, 1888, entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00114.html">The First Dandelion</a>." A note on the bottom of the page states "sent
      to Herald March 11" indicating the draft was likely composed around the time of
      publication.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n1044">2. Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.
      For more on Emerson, see Jerome Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4301">3. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881)
      was a Scottish essayist, historian, lecturer, and philosopher. For more on
      Carlyle, see John D. Rosenberg, <em>Carlyle and the Burden of
         History</em> (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1985).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n0625">4. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00162_n3">5. Samuel Clemens
      (1835–1910), better know by his pen name, Mark Twain, had attended
      Whitman's New York lecture in April of 1887. He also contributed to Thomas
      Donaldson's fund for the purchase of a horse and buggy for Whitman (see
      Whitman's  letter [note 4]), as
      well as to the fund to build Whitman a private cottage (see Whitman's  letter to Sylvester Baxter). Twain
      was reported in the Boston <em>Herald</em> of May 24, 1887, to
      have said: "What we want to do is to make the splendid old soul comfortable"
      (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades</em> [1931],
      268).<a href="#r5">[back]
