   <p>Am surviving yet &amp; in good spirits (sort) after the past nearly four
      months—Am still imprison'd here in my sick room, unable to move around or get
      out at all—but have my brain power as before &amp; right arm
      volition—(now reduced to them what great blessings they are!)—<u>November Boughs</u><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> is all done printed
      &amp; press'd &amp; waits the binding—will send you one as soon as I get
      it—then I am to have a <u>Complete</u> W W in one large 900
      Vol. ($6) L of G, Spec. Days, &amp; Nov. B—all &amp; several condensed in
      one<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup>—this is now going through the presses—your
      bust of me still holds out fully in my estimation.—I consider it (to me at any
      rate) the best &amp; most characteristic really artistic &amp; satisfactory
      rendering of any—so tho't by me.—the bust of Elias Hicks<sup><a href="#n4265" id="r3">3</a></sup> pleases &amp; satisfies me first rate—goes to the right
      spot—the little arm chair statuette is here (as when you left it) &amp; must
      not be forgotten<sup><a href="#loc.03185_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup>—it is valuable
      exceedingly—Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> is invaluable to me—I
      couldn't have done anything with the printing without him—Whether I shall get
      out of this <u>slough</u> remains uncertain—I am
      comfortable—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3999">1. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4265">3. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a
      traveling Quaker preacher and anti-slavery activist from Long Island, New York.
      For more on Hicks, see Henry Watson Wilbur, <em>The Life and
         Labors of Elias Hicks</em> (Philadelphia: Friends' General Conference
      Advancement Committee, 1910).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.03185_n1">4. A photograph of the
      plaster model of this work serves as <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/whole.html">the frontispiece of Horace Traubel's third volume</a> of <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (New York: Mitchell
      Kennerley, 1914).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
