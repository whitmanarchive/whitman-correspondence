   <p>I have your letter of 5.30 P.M. wednesday (5th) and am
      greatly releived at the result of the consultation as far as I understand it at
      present. I had a letter, also by this mornings mail, from Osler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r2">2</a></sup> written 5th but <u>before</u> the consultation
      it is however very cheering—<sup><a href="#loc.07278_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>I want to impress upon
      you however that you certainly should be seen (for the present) <u>every day</u> by some good doctor who would call in Osler from time to time as
      necessary. Osler agrees with me that this would be the proper
      thing to do. You had better take some clever <u>young</u> (at
      least not old) <u>Camden</u> man for the regular daily attendant.
      Thank you very much for "Shakespeare-Bacon's Cipher" It is too bad that it was missed out of "Sands" for it
      is a good piece.<sup><a href="#loc.07278_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am confident that your present painful symptoms can be greatly alleviated (if not
      removed) by careful management but you <u>must</u> be seen at
      least once a day in order that you may be closely watched and the proper steps taken
      at once from day to day—
   </p>
   
   <p>I want you to show this letter to Traubel to save me repeating it to him</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4302">2. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on
      Osler, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitman-dev.unl.edu/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_202.html">Osler, Dr. William (1849–1919)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on the relationship of Osler and

   <p id="loc.07278_n2">3. The letters from Osler
      to Bucke, written both before and after the consultation, appear to be lost.
      Bucke does, however, quote from the one written <em>after</em>
      consultation. On December 8, 1888, he wrote Traubel: "It [Osler's letter]
      contains this passage 'His general condition is good and do not let them alarm
      you unnecessarily, it is only an old mans bladder and though troublesome need
      not be dangerous unless of course his kidneys should give up work'" (The Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]

      1887) and later included <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em> (1891).<a href="#r4">[back]
