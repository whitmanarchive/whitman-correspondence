   <p>Your letter came all right last Monday, &amp; the papers. Send me the <u>Herald</u> to-morrow, (with one blue stamp on) you needn't
      mind the other Sunday papers—I send you Harper's magazine for
      September—I am still holding my own—gain a little strength, &amp; am
      certainly improving though very slowly—both head &amp; leg are bad enough, but
      <u>general</u>
      <u>feeling</u> is much better, most of the time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have sent Philadelphia papers once or twice &amp; may again—there is nothing
      in them, but I thought you would know I was still around—The weather here is
      pleasant, &amp; cool enough, favorable to me—I get out a little every
      day—am going out when I finish this—Cannot write much
      to-day—am having a bad head ache all day—still I feel in good heart. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01659_n1">1. Though, admittedly, there
      is little concrete information in this letter to aid in establishing the year,
      the executors' assignment of this letter to 1875 seems questionable for the
      following reasons: in a letter to Doyle of , Whitman also asked for a copy of the Sunday <em>Herald</em>; he expected this letter to arrive in Washington on Saturday,
      August 30—"Send me the <em>Herald</em> to-morrow"; and in
      1875 he invariably gave his Camden street address in the headings of his
      letters.<a href="#r1">[back]
