   <p>I do not know but Ben told you that I was in the Lunatic
      Asylum
      during the time that himself [
      <span class="unclear">John?</span>]
       &amp; Charley were 
      recieving
      
       hard knocks for Uncle Sam &amp; his [
      <span class="unclear">dimes?</span>]
      . Well, I do not regret the 15 months
      that I spent there in two installments.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>[
      <span class="unclear">And?</span>]
      
      what a sad lesson I learned there of young America.
   </p>
   
   <p>A line in Leaves of Grass led me to think that you was the very man to get him out
      of
      the Scrape, or at least to show him his danger, of which he seemed quite ignorant.
      In the Asylum I saw "living bodys" that had been so badly defiled by forcing 
      semon
      
      
      
      thro
      
       the hand as to retain but little of the human.

   <p>More than half the 
      pacients
      
       in the institutions, [
      <span class="unclear">are?</span>]
       there from this cause, And half of the other half from dodging
      the 
      noblist
      
       work of man, because of the expense of raising children, and other
      imaginary 
      troblis
      
      , or as I once heard a young Baptist deacon say—"I won't have my
      pretty wife all tore to pieces having young-ones. Mad as they are in the Asylum,
      this is greater madness. Could not the coming young American be induced to do this
      noblest work manfully &amp; womanly if benevolent liberals were to form themselves
      unto a Society for the purpose of taking naked infants from their mothers bring them
      up naked, and marry them at the age of about eight years bringing all Sciënce
      [

       all human
      power to their <u>right</u> mating or [
      <span class="unclear">pairing?</span>]
      . Walt my dear
      friend, there is no investment that will pay like this. Do you See it? If not there
      is only God &amp; I that sees it.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you do I know what 
      youd
      
       do. I will not ask you to reply to this, tho' nothing could afford me more
      pleasure. But I have no right to take what, but for me, would fall to the Soldier
      boys

   <p>P.S. In looking over if find I have rather neglected female young America in my

       I do not
      mean to say that all our young who practice it, they are of all ages in the Asylum up 
      too
      
       eighty years; But I think the habit must have been formed in
