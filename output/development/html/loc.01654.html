      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing special to write you, about myself, or any thing else, this week. Your letter
      &amp; the Herald came last Monday. 
      The time goes very tedious with me—&amp; yet I think I am getting better, (but don't know
      for sure.)—Still have frequent bad spells.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I stopt at the W. Philadelphia depot, Market street, two or three evenings ago, in the general
      passengers' room, 
      to rest, about 10 minutes. Then took the car for Market st. ferry, (a mile and a half,
      or three quarters) 
      &amp; over to Camden, home.—I get desperate at staying in,—not a <u>human</u> soul for cheer, or sociability or fun—&amp; this continued week after week &amp; month after
      month—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So you met Johnny Saunders, in Baltimore, &amp; he is flourishing. If you see him again,
      
      tell him to write to me,—he is a young man I always loved.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>½ past 2</u>—I have just had a nice oyster stew for my dinner—it is blustering weather, partly
      clear, 
      partly cloudy, &amp; one or two little flirts of snow to-day. I send you a paper or two,
      but nothing in them. 
      I will try to stop in Philadelphia &amp; find that little dictionary I promised you—
   </p>
   <p>So long, my loving son,</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01654_n1">1. The only clue to the date
      is the reference to the dictionary, which Whitman mentioned in his letter to
      Doyle of . April 3, 1874, is a
      possibility since it is the only Friday in the early part of the year for which
      there is no extant letter or card. There is an envelope in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C., with the following postmarks: Camden | Apr | 3 |
      N.J.; Carrier | 4 | Ap(?) | 8 AM.<a href="#r1">[back]
