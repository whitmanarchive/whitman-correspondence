      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>[Nothing] particular new with me. I am well &amp; hearty—think a good deal about home.
      Mother, I so much want to see you, even if only for a couple of weeks—for I feel I
      must return here &amp; continue my hospital operations. They are so much needed, although
      one can do only such a little in comparison, amid these thousands. Then I desire much
      to see Andrew.<sup><a href="#loc.00798_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I wonder if I could cheer him up any—does he get any good from that treatment with
      the baths, &amp;c. Mother, I suppose you have your hands full with Nancy's poor little
      children, &amp; one worry &amp; another (when one gets old little things bother a great deal).
      Mother, I go down every day looking for a letter from you or Jeff—I had two from Jeff latter part of
      the week.<sup><a href="#loc.00798_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I want to see Jeff much. I wonder why he didn't send me the Union with my letter
      in.<sup><a href="#loc.00798_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am disappointed at not getting it. I sent Han [a] N Y Times with my last letter,
      &amp; one to George too. Have you heard any thing from George or Han?
   </p> 
   
   <p>There is a new lot of wounded now again.<sup><a href="#loc.00798_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> They have been arriving, sick &amp; wounded, for three days—First long strings of ambulances
      with the sick. But yesterday many with bad &amp; bloody wounds, poor fellows. I thought
      I was cooler &amp; more used to it, but the sight of some of them brought tears into my eyes—Mother, I had the good luck yesterday to do quite a great
      deal of good—I had provided a lot of nourishing things for the men, but for another
      quarter—but I had them where I could use them immediately for these new wounded as
      they came in faint &amp; hungry, &amp; fagged out with a long rough journey, all dirty &amp; torn,
      &amp; many pale as ashes, &amp; all bloody—I distributed all my stores, gave partly to the
      nurses I knew that were just taking charge of them—&amp; as many as I could I fed myself—Then
      besides I found a lot of oyster soup handy, &amp; I procured it all at once—Mother, it
      is the most pitiful sight I think when first the men are brought in—I have to bustle round, to keep from crying—they are such rugged young
      men—all these just arrived are cavalry men—Our troops got the worst of it, but fought
      like devils. Our men engaged were Kilpatrick's<sup><a href="#loc.00798_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> cavalry. They were in the rear as part of Meade's retreat—&amp; the reb cavalry cut in
      between &amp; cut them off &amp; [attacked] them &amp; shelled them terribly. But Kilpatrick brought
      them out mostly—this was last Sunday.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I will try to come home before long, if only for six or eight days. I wish
      to see you, &amp; Andrew—I wish to see the young ones &amp; Mat. You must write. I am about
      moving,<sup><a href="#loc.00798_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I have been hunting for a room to-day—I shall write next how I succeed. Good by for
      present, dear mother.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00798_n1">1. While Walt Whitman
      remained in Washington, tension was increasing among the Whitmans in Brooklyn.
      Jeff was incensed by his mother's frugality. On , he commented to Walt: "I certainly think Mother
      is following a mistaken notion of economy. I think the only decent meals that
      any of them have had for three months is what they have eaten with Mat and I";
      and again on : "There is no doubt,
      Walt, in my mind but that mother is doing injury both to herself and Jess by her
      economy, they do not have enough good things to eat…I have spoken of it till I
      have tired and it dont accomplish anything." See also notes to Whitman's letter
      from . Meanwhile, Andrew refused
      the advice of Dr. Ruggles and of Jeff, and he accepted the expensive
      ministrations of a quack who, Jeff said on , "told Andrew yesterday that he must not come there again till he
      brought him $45 more. Only think of it. The infernal son of a bitch. I would
      like to hang him for a thousand years, ten times a second." Dr. Ruggles,
      according to Jeff's letter of ,
      "thinks that it is more than wicked to take his [Andrew's] money and make
      believe to cure him, for in his opinion that is almost impossible…his lungs are
      much diseased." Repeatedly, and with some hostility, Jeff urged Walt to return
      home. Writing on , he pleaded:
      "Dear Walt, do come home if only for a short time. And unless you come quite
      soon you certainly will never see Andrew alive." Though there was little excuse
      for delay, Whitman remained in Washington until November 2.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00798_n4">4. This paragraph was later
      printed in <em>November Boughs</em> (Richard Maurice Bucke, ed.,
      <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.
      P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 6:225–226) with alterations that reduced the
      original effectiveness of the material.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.00798_n5">5. Hugh Judson Kilpatrick
      (1836–1881) distinguished himself as a commander of cavalry. He was with
      Meade at Gettysburg and in the campaigns in Virginia from August to November,
      1863. In his "Hospital Book 12" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Whitman, after
      " 'chinning' with some soldier in hospital," elaborated on Kilpatrick's conduct.
      His cavalry cut off and outnumbered, the general ordered his two bands to play:
      "They joined, &amp; played Yankee Doodle, it went through the men like
      lightning, every man seemed a giant. They charged &amp; cut their way out with
      the loss of 20 men." See also <em>November Boughs</em>,
