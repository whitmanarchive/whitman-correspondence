      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you for your kind &amp; warm invitation to write a Blaine poem—but I
      shall not be able to accept it<sup><a href="#med.00713_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you heartily too for the pay (more than I asked &amp; more than it is worth)
      for the little <em>Red Jacket</em> bit<sup><a href="#med.00713_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—but it has not yet come to hand—most likely will come soon—I am
      about as usual—only very lame.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      the amount he received from Williams in his Commonplace Book. Since he was paid
      $10 for his next contribution to the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>,
      probably he received the same amount for "Red Jacket (from Aloft)."<a href="#r2">[back]
