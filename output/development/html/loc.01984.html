      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I regret very much that I am obliged to write to you again, but as I am very much
      in need of some money just as soon as possible I thought perhaps you would be willing
      to settle up your bill if you do you will greatly oblige me we have nearly two hundred
      &amp; fifty dollars besides the regular expenses to pay within the next twenty days so
      you will see that we will need all that
      
      
      
      
      we can make or get that is due us. Your bill was up to the first of August thirty
      eight dollars ($38.00) I am willing to give you ten dollars ($10.00) for the things
      which I took from you that is nearly as much as they would cost if new and as much
      as they are worth to me. Then you will still owe twenty eight ($28.00) which if you
      could let me have this week will be a great favorâ€”
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course I will not charge you for keeping your things since, but I would be glad
      if you would have them removed soon
   </p>

      Yours Respectfully
      <br></br>Mrs Isabella A White

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Walt Whitman stayed with Dr. George
      A. White, a chiropodist, and his wife Isabella A. White from March 1, 1871,
      until Whitman left Washington. Whitman had paid $236 in rent through June
      10, 1873 (The Library of Congress #73). On November 28, 1873, Dr. acknowledged
      for his wife receipt of $28 "on account . . . for rent of room etc from May
      1st/73" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection). Walt Whitman gave up one room at the
      Whites' on June 10, 1873: "Kept the other at $2.50 a month" (The Library of
      Congress #68). According to a letter dated , Isabella White had written, evidently early in July, about the
      rent due for his room; Whitman's reply is not extant. On the 29th, White offered
      to purchase Walt Whitman's bedstead and certain other effects. Walt Whitman had
      not settled his account when White wrote again on , and offered him a credit of $10 for his
      furnishings against a balance of $38. These letters are in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection.(See also Walt Whitman's , letter to Peter Doyle, in which Whitman left instructions for
      the delivery of his boxes from the Whites.)
