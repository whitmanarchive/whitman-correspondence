      <br></br><br></br>Dear John
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I keep on fairly in health &amp; strength—have been out here a few days the
      guest of Mr &amp; Mrs F B Sanborn—&amp; everything most affectionate &amp; hospitable from
      them both—&amp; from others—Have had a curiously full and satisfactory
      time with Emerson—he came to see me Saturday evening early, Mrs E also, &amp; 
      staid
      
       two hours—Yesterday I went there (by pressing invitation) to dinner,
      &amp; 
      staid
      
       two hours—a wonderfully good two hours—the whole family were
      very cordial, including Mrs. E. &amp; the son, Edward, a doctor, a fine, handsome,
      'cute, glowing young man, with a beautiful wife and child—I took to them
      all—I cannot tell you how sweet and good (and all as it should be) Emerson 
      look'd
      
       and behaved—he did not talk, in the way of joining in any animated
      conversation, but pleasantly and hesitatingly &amp; sparsely—fully
      enough—to me it seemed just as it should be—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The book is about through—will appear last of October—every thing
      satisfactory—I go from here in about a week to Johnston's, 
      cor:
      
       Mott avenue &amp; 149th 
      St.
      
      
      
      N.Y.—then to Camden—shall go to Canada this winter—
