      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had a call a week or two ago<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup> from a Cambridge fellow lecturer <u>R. D. Roberts</u>—a Welshman. He is starting for America the 20th of this month—going to Iowa to spend some time
      on a farm there, then returning to England. Wants very much to see you en route. He has
      asked me to write and find out where you will be the first week of August. I suppose
      you won't mind seeing him if anywhere within call. He seems a very genuine fellow
      (I never saw
      him before) but is rather diffident about bothering you. Says you mention Wales or
      the Welsh <u>twice</u> in your book! Could you send a postcard
      Robert D. Roberts Post Office, New York—saying where you will be early in August?
      Anyhow I will tell him to call at your address in Camden.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received a letter from Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup>—which I shall answer presently. I like
      his address to the Teachers Association very much. Thanks for several papers you
      have sent lately. I do enjoy this outdoor life and digging potatoes—and never
      mean to abandon either again! I am living with a man—the best
      friend I ever had or could think to have—an iron worker, scythe riveter, and
      his little family. He often says 'I wish Walt Whitman would come over here'. Below
      my window here there is a wooded bank running down to some water, and beyond again
      about 2 miles off the hilly undulating line of the Derbyshire moors—from which
      there comes a broad fresh breeze—like being near the sea.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
