   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw the RR. smash the first thing in the paper in the morning, &amp; run my eyes over
      the account with fear 
      &amp; trembling—&amp; only on reading it over a second time, was I satisfied that you were
      not in it—poor souls! 
      for I suppose every one that <u>was</u> in it, had some who heard or read the news with pain &amp; terror—some parent, 
      wife, friend, or child—poor Buchanan—but I hope, from accounts, that he will get up
      again, before long, 
      without serious damage—The papers here publish full, &amp; I guess very good accounts
      of the whole affair—I liked what the <u>Star</u> said so plainly—that <u>the cause below all others</u>, of such accidents, is because 
      they run such a route, <u>over a single track</u>—you may remember my warning on the same point three years ago, 
      in a talk with you
   </p> 
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Pete, this spring finds me pretty much in the same tedious &amp; half-way condition I
      have been lingering in now 
      over two years—up &amp; around every day, look not much different, &amp; eat pretty well—but
      not a day passes without 
      some bad spells, sometimes <u>very bad</u>—&amp; never a real good night's sleep—yet still I have a sort of feeling not 
      to give it up yet—keep real good spirits—don't get blue, even at my worst spells—I
      am sitting here to-day as usual alone in the front room, by the window—feel pretty
      comfortable—the weather 
      is bright &amp; pleasant here to-day, but cool for the season, &amp; the most backward I have
      ever known—My sister 
      is going away for some 10 days to-morrow or next day, &amp; I shall be quite alone in
      the house—wish you could come 
      on &amp; pay me a visit—Would you like to have me direct any letters or papers to the
      American Hotel, Balt. 
      or shall I just direct to you at Wash. as usual?
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
