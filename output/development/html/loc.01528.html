      <br></br>Brooklyn, <br xmlns="" class="opener">Saturday afternoon, July 30.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01528_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01528_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well here I am home again with my mother, writing to you from Brooklyn once more.
      We parted
      there, you know, at the corner of 7th st. Tuesday night. Pete, there was something
      in that
      hour from 10 to 11 oclock (parting though it was) that has left me pleasure &amp; comfort
      for good—I never dreamed that you made so much of having me with you, nor that you
      could feel so downcast at losing me. I foolishly thought it was all on the other side.
      But
      all I will say further on the subject is, I now see clearly, that was all wrong. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I started from the depot in the 7:25 train the next morning—it was pretty warm, yet
      I
      had a very pleasant journey, &amp; we got in New York by 5 o'clock, afternoon. About half
      an
      hour before we arrived, I noticed a very agreeable change in the weather—the heat
      had
      moderated—&amp; in fact it has been pleasant enough every day since. I found mother
      &amp; all as well as usual. It is now Saturday between 4 &amp; 5 in the afternoon—I
      will write more on the other side—but, Pete, I must now hang up for the present, as
      there is a young lady down stairs whom I have promised to go with to the ferry, &amp;
      across
      to the cars. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sunday—6 p. m. </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, dear boy, I will write you a line to-day before I go. I am going over to New
      York to
      visit the lady I went down to the ferry with—so you see I am quite a lady's man again
      in my old days—There is nothing special to write about—I am feeling in
      first-rate spirits, &amp; eat my rations every time. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Monday, Aug 1 </p>
   
   
   <p>The carrier brought quite a bunch this forenoon for the Whitman family, but no letter
      from
      you. I keep real busy with one thing &amp; another, the whole day is occupied—I am
      feeling well quite all the time, &amp; go out a great deal, knocking around one place
      &amp;
      another. The evenings here are delightful and I am always out in them, sometimes on
      the
      river, sometimes in New York—There is a cool breeze &amp; the moon shining. I think
      every time of you, &amp; wish if we could only be together these evenings at any rate.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tuesday—Aug 2. </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, Pete, you will have quite a diary at this rate. Your letter came this
      morning—&amp; I was glad enough to get word from you. I have been over to New York
      to-day on business—it is a pleasure even to cross the ferry—the river is
      splendid to-day—a stiff breeze blowing &amp; the smell of the salt sea blowing up,
      (sweeter than any perfume to <em>my</em> nose)—It is now 2
      o'clock—I have had my dinner &amp; am sitting here alone writing this—Love to
      you, dear Pete—&amp; I wont be so long again writing to my darling boy.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

      During this extended leave, from July 27 to October 15, 1870, Walt Whitman
      was to see through the presses three works, the fifth edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, <em>Passage to
         India</em>, and the much-delayed <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>. The electroplates for these works were made by Smith &amp;
      McDougal, and J. S. Redfield was the publisher, though his name did not
      appear on the title pages; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955), 583–584.<br><br>
      A few days before Walt Whitman left Washington, he made one of his most
      enigmatic entries in a notebook on July 15, 1870: "TO GIVE UP ABSOLUTELY
      &amp; for good, from this present hour, this FEVERISH, FLUCTUATING, useless
      undignified pursuit of 164—too long, (much too long) persevered
      in,—so humiliating—It must come at last &amp; had better come
      now—(It cannot possibly be a success) LET THERE FROM THIS HOUR BE NO
      FALTERING, NO GETTING [<em>erasure</em>] at all henceforth,
      (NOT ONCE, under any circumstances)—avoid seeing her, or meeting her,
      or any talk or explanations—or ANY MEETING WHATEVER, FROM THIS HOUR
      FORTH, FOR LIFE" (Library of Congress; <em>The Uncollected
         Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Emory Holloway [Garden City,
      New York: Doubleday, Page, and Company, 1921], 2:96). For interpretations,
      see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (1955),
      421–425, and Roger Asselineau, <em>L'évolution de
         Walt Whitman</em> (1955), 192–193, who concludes that feminine
      pronouns were substituted for masculine. "164" was undoubtedly intended to
      conceal Doyle's initials, P (16) D (4).
