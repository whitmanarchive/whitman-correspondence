   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00668_n1">1. Richard Maurice Bucke
      assigned the date 1891, confirmed by Whitman's letter to Hannah dated Sept. 14,
      1891 (<em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New
      York: New York University Press, 1969], 5:242), in which he mentions troubles
      with his eyesight: "one of my greatest botherations is the dimming of eye sight
      — incipient blindness." Hannah probably started writing this letter in the
      morning and finished it later in the afternoon, as she notes. Throughout the
      letter, at times it appears that many of the periods function as commas.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n2">2. The exact nature of this
      injury to Hannah's left hand is not clear. The thumb on Hannah's left hand was
      amputated in December 1868.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n3">3. Horace Traubel's article,
      "Walt Whitman at Date," was published in the May 1891 edition of the <em>New England Magazine</em> (Vol. IV, no. 3),
      275–292.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n4">4. Frederick Warren Fritzinger
      (1866–1899), known as "Warry," served as Whitman's nurse beginning in
      October 1889. Mrs. Mary Davis, Whitman's housekeeper, had taken care of Warry's
      father, an aged seaman. When he died she inherited half of his property; the
      other half was left to Warry and his brother Harry, who had run off to sea at
      the ages of seventeen and fourteen. A picture of Warry is displayed in the May
      1891 <em>New England Magazine</em> (278). "Of all the nurses
      Whitman had, Warry was his favorite," Gay Wilson Allen notes (see <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1985], 519,
      535).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n5">5. Richard Maurice Bucke
      (1837–1901), Medical Doctor and Head of the Asylum for the Insane in
      Ontario Canada, a friend of Whitman's, had been visiting Whitman in Camden the
      first week of September. Bucke returned to Canada on September 10. See Walt's
      letter to Hannah Heyde, Sept. 8 1891, in Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York UP,
      1969), 5:240.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n6">6. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman
      (1842–1892), known as Lou, married George Whitman on April 14, 1871. They
      moved to Camden in 1872, and Walt Whitman lived with them from 1873–84.
      See Karen Wolfe, "Whitman, Louisa Orr Haslam (Mrs. George) (1842–1892),"
      <em> Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland, 1998), 781.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n7">7. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the seventh child of Walter and Louisa Whitman. George
      learned to read and write as a pupil under his older brother Walt (who briefly
      served as a schoolteacher) in Long Island, and worked as a carpenter prior to
      his military service during the Civil War. When the war ended, he became a pipe
      inspector for the City of Camden and the New York Metropolitan Water Board. See
      Martin G. Murray, "Whitman, George Washington," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland, 1998), 777–78.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n8">8. Hannah is referring to
      Charles Heyde.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n9">9. Jessie Louisa Whitman
      (1863–1957), also known as California, and, later, as Sis, the youngest
      daughter of Thomas Jefferson Whitman and Martha Emma Whitman. Jessie may not
      have been named the moment she was born; Whitman refers to her as the "little
      girl" and as "little black head" in his letters to Mother Whitman dated June 22,
      1863 and July 15, 1863, respectively (<em>Walt Whitman
         Archive</em>).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00668_n10">10. Thomas Jefferson Whitman,
      (1833–1890), Jeff, was the eighth child of Walter and Louisa Whitman.
      Walt's favorite brother, Jeff played the piano and had a lively sense of humor.
      He married Mattie Emma Mitchell on February 23, 1859. Jeff and Mattie moved in
      with Mother Whitman shortly after their marriage. In 1867, Jeff accepted a
      position as chief engineer and superintendent of waterworks in St. Louis,
      Missouri. Jeff died on November 25, 1890, from typhoid pneumonia. See <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em>, ed. Dennis Berthold and Kenneth Price (Kent, Ohio: Kent State
      UP, 1984), xxxiv.<a href="#r10">[back]
