      Isabella Ford | Adel Grange | Leeds | England. It is postmarked: Camden N.J. |

   <p id="nyp.00504_n2">2. Elizabeth (Bessie) and
      Isabella Ford, English friends of Edward Carpenter, ordered books on . On June 27, Whitman noted sending "L
      of G &amp; S.D. (two vols) to Bessie Ford" (<em>Daybooks and
         Notebooks</em>, ed. William White [New York: New York University Press,
      1977], 2:325). Six months later Isabella ordered the same books for herself.
      Though no letter of receipt is currently known, Whitman marked the order "paid"
      (<em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, 2:325).<a href="#r2">[back]
