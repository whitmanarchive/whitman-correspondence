      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Allow me with the deepest reverence &amp; true affection to thank you for the copy of
      your complete poems I have just received from you 
      thro
      
       our excellent friend Mr. Conway<sup><a href="#n0170" id="r1">1</a></sup>—&amp; still more for
      the accompanying letter to him, in which you authorize me to make, in the
      forthcoming London 
      issue
      
       of your poems, such verbal changes as may appear to me indispensable  to meet the
      requirements of publicity in this country &amp; time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I feel greatly 
      honoured
      
       by your tolerance extended to me in this respect, &amp; 
      assure
      
       you that, if such a 
      permission
      
       can in the nature of things be used rightly it shall not be abused by
      me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My selection was settled more than a month ago, &amp; is now going 
      thro'
      
       the 
      press
      
      . The only writing of yours from 
      wh.
      
       I thought it at all 
      admissible
      
       (with your consent applied for 
      thro
      
       Mr. Conway) to cut anything out was the prose preface to the first Leaves
      of 
      Grass
      
      . As for the <u>poems</u>, I felt bound not to tamper
      with their  integrity
      in any the slighted degree, &amp; therefore any of them which appeared to contain
      matter startling to the length of British ears have been entirely excluded. But now,
      after your letter it seems to me that all or most of these poems, with some minimum
      of verbal modification or excision, may very properly be included: &amp; indeed that
      there is nothing to prevent a reprint of the revised copy of your complete poems (
      wh.
      
       you sent to Mr. Conway) coming out at once, <u>instead</u> of the mere selection—subject only to modification or excision
      here &amp; there as above named.  Of course I 
      wd.
      
       explain in print that the responsibility of this shabby job belongs to
      me—fortified only by your abstaining from prohibiting it; for such a prohibition 
      wd.
      
       be sacred to me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just written in this sense to the publisher Mr. Hotten.<sup><a href="#n0311" id="r2">2</a></sup> I
      cannot clearly anticipate whether or not he will be disposed thus to sacrifice his
      outlay hitherto on the selection, &amp; embark at once on the complete edition. If
      he does, it will please me all the better. I shall always hold it one of the truest
      &amp; most prized distinctions of my writing career to be 
      associated
      
      , in however modest  a capacity, with the works of so great a poet &amp; noble-hearted
      a man as you. The time is fast coming, here as elsewhere, when to be one of your
      enthusiastic admirers will only be to be one of the many. I shall remember with a
      degree of self-congratulation that in 1855 I was one of the few.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0170">1. Moncure Daniel Conway (1832–1907) was an
      American abolitionist and frequent correspondent with Walt Whitman. Conway often
      acted as Whitman's agent and occasional public relations man in England. For
      more on Conway, see Philip W. Leon, ""<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_182.html">Conway Moncure Daniel (1832–1907)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 148.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0311">2. John Camden Hotten (1832–1873) re-issued
      Algernon Charles Swinburne's first <em>Poems and Ballads</em> in
      1866 after the public outcry caused Swinburne's previous publisher to withdraw.
      Perhaps because he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten
      introduced such writers as Robert Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
      and Bret Harte to an English audience. After his death, his business was
      purchased by Chatto &amp; Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866,
      O'Connor had suggested Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems
      to me the courage that prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale). Walt Whitman
      was dissatisfied with Hotten's work, referring to the publisher as "the English
      pirate-publisher" in a , letter to
      Rudolf Schmidt. For Whitman's relationship with Hotten and the "bad &amp;
      defective" edition, see Whitman's , letter to Moncure D. Conway.<a href="#r2">[back]
