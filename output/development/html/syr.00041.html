   <p>Monday night, tuesday night and wednesday night on account of traveling and one
      botheration or another I had short allowance of sleep so last night I went to bed
      early and slept 9 1/2 hours without waking or I believe moving and today I feel
      better. [—] We are having quite spring like weather here, warm &amp; bright.
      This evening it looks a little like rain, by all appearance we shall have an early
      spring—our grounds are already full of robins—in the early morning they
      sing as if it was the middle of april.
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you today a piece I wrote for an uncle more than thirty years ago about my
      old
      wanderings in the States 53–58 [/]<sup><a href="#syr.00041_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I do not know whether
      you ever saw it [/] if not it may amuse you for a few minutes. I promised Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r3">3</a></sup> to send him a copy of my Saguenay poem<sup><a href="#syr.00041_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> but please tell him I cannot find one and fear they are
      all gone.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am hard at work getting into the run of things after by absence [/] in another day
      or two it will be just as if I had been here all the time.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all well, the health of the institution is first class. My Annual Report is
      out—I have written for some copies and shall send you one as soon as I get
      them
   </p>
   
   <p>I am reading nothing, far too busy, feeling first rate</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="syr.00041_n1">1. Horace Traubel's note,
      "see | notes | March 24 | 1889," appears in the upper left-hand corner of the
      recto. The reference is to Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.63.html">Sunday, March 24, 1889</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="syr.00041_n2">2. Bucke's own accounts of
      his wanderings were published as "Twenty-Five Years Ago," <em>Overland Monthly</em>, 1, second series (June 1883), 553–60 and "On
      the Humboldt," London <em>Advertiser</em>, (28 June 1888); see
      also Coyne, pp. 16–29.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">3. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="syr.00041_n3">4. Whitman incorporated
      Bucke's poem in his article "Letter from Walt Whitman [on St. Lawrence River
      Trip]," which was published 26 August 1880 in the London (Ontario) <em>Advertiser</em>, the <em>Camden Daily Post</em>,
      and the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>. The article contained ten
      paragraphs, and according to Whitman paragraphs 7–8 were by Bucke (<em>PW</em>, I, 346).<a href="#r4">[back]
