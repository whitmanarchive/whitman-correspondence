   <p>Have just read the piece of our little spectacled brother Symond<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      on W W. As before his plain utterance seemed to you, so now to me. This seems
      somehow comic—so inadequate is it + "off." Yet there is some good weft in the
      shoddy—a little. S. lacks healthy contact with the live world. Did you ever
      hear that the Booths<sup><a href="#n3017" id="r2">2</a></sup><sup><a href="#loc.05827_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> were of
      Dutch origin? Mrs K. is sure she read it. I have searched all the books in vain,
      tho' I find a little Welsh blood in their family. What curious blood—[

       broad-[
      <span class="unclear">vanned?</span>]
       South windy! Have
      been dipping into Boccaccio. He is a healthy fellow, but his stories are too much
      for <u>any</u> flesh. My imagination is too vivid. I have to
      throw him aside.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0615">1. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

      translated around 40 works of French literature and wrote a history of New York.
