      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter, &amp; the papers you so kindly sent me, both very
      welcome. The sight of the
      Washington papers forthwith induces a fit of homesickness in poor
      'Suly' who seems to pine for the place and our old home
      there more than I do. I have got somewhat wonted here, &amp; then I am busy &amp;
      have many things to interest me, &amp; she has little or nothing. Then the home in 
      W.
      
       was of course more to her than to me; her time was all passed there &amp;
      only a part of mine. Still at times my thoughts will go
      back
      &amp; hover &amp; nestle about the little home &amp; the many familiar places. I
      expect it will be a good while before either of us are weaned from 
      W.
      
       I am about to sell the place. The bargain can be closed whenever I come on
      which will be by Sunday I think. Then we will be quite homeless again &amp; I expect
      the wife will be unhappy enough. I hope to be in 
      W.
      
       on Sunday evening, or Monday morning. I was grieved dear Walt that you was
      still confined to 
      W.
      
       &amp; not able to go home; but your faith in your ultimate entire recovery
      is cheering. I hope it may be more speedy. I look forward to many delightful days
      with you yet, after I have built me another nest up here by the Hudson You will come
      and spend weeks &amp; months with us &amp; we will all be happy
      again.
      The spring is backward here; no lilacs yet &amp; no signs of any. But the grass, the
      good green grass, is wonderful. It seems as if I never saw it so perfect before.
      This you know is a great grazing &amp; butter country, &amp; the fields &amp; the spread of
      farms around are delightful to behold. They have something of the smooth, mellow,
      well kept look of the English fields, while their freshness &amp; tenderness are
      marvelous. I graze in them with my eyes
      daily.
      Grass like this is never seen so far south on the Potomac. Yesterday I made a trip
      to Sugar Loaf Mountain 15 miles below here &amp; could see over
      nearly the whole country from its summit, &amp; could see the Catskills 50 miles to
      the North, &amp; peaks that I recognized as visible from my 
      parents
      
       home in Delaware 
      Co.
      
      . But the rolling succession of green fields was the most wonderful.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have plenty of time on my hands now but do not seem able to turn it to any account
      in a literary way. I am like a cow that has lost her "cud." I can't get back my
      ruminating habit.
      If I could only begin once more I think there are several pieces I could write. I
      have seen my father
      make an artificial cud for a cow, but I know of no receipt by which I can compound
      an intellectual one for
      myself.
      The first of my bird pieces with Scribner will not be out till
      July; when "The Birds of the Poets" will be out I have not
      heard.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I take the "Tribune" so had seen the letter about Emerson. I am glad
      the old fellow is having a good time. Conway is no doubt
      happy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wife sends much love. Hoping to see you in a few days I am</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
