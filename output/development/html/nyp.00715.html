   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00715_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street | Washington D C. It is postmarked:
      Camden, N.J. | Jun 14 | 6 PM | 88. It is endorsed: "Answ'd June 15/88."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00715_n2">2. Troubled by newspaper
      reports of the poet's illness, O'Connor wrote for information on  (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.75.html">Friday, April 5, 1889</a>). The almost fatal illness during the early
      part of June is fully recorded in Traubel's entry of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.68.html"> Monday, June 4, 1888</a>. Fortunately Bucke had come to Camden on June
      3, 1888 (see Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.67.html">Sunday, June 3, 1888</a>), and Nathan M. Baker became the poet's nurse on
      June 10 (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html"> Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). At first Whitman resisted, but for the rest
      of his life he was not without male nurses. On August 10 Traubel noted: "I have
      started a Whitman fund—am trying to get a small monthly guarantee each
      from a group of people to pay for the nurse and the extras required by Whitman's
      persistent illness" (see Traubel's entry of <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.27.html">Friday, August 10, 1888</a>). Among the contributors were Stedman (see
      Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.31.html">Tuesday, August 14, 1888</a>), Richard Watson Gilder (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>), Josephine Lazarus (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.72.html">Tuesday, April 2, 1889</a>), and Andrew Carnegie (see Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.66.html">Wednesday, March 27, 1889</a>). When Whitman learned of the fund on March
      20, 1889, "he was greatly touched: the tears came into his eyes" (Traubel, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.59.html">Wednesday, March 20, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">4. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">5. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
