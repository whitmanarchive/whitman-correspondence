      <br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I <u>fear</u> you
      do not
      fully appreciate my relations to the Springfield Repub-people <u>anent</u> the W.
      W article.<sup><a href="#loc.05890_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>There has been a good deal of writing about it, between them &amp; me—and
      about two weeks ago I sent on
       a <u>red-hot</u> interview of my own with H W Beecher.<sup><a href="#n0066" id="r3">3</a></sup> Well: they didn't "bite" at the HWB-MSS—it was a trifle
      too <u>warm</u> &amp; cut both ways Blaine-&amp;anti-Blaine<sup><a href="#loc.03721_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>                <u>but</u> the managing editor quietly says "We are still
      waiting for that long-promised article on Walt Whitman"—
   </p>
   
   <p>I <u>thereupon promised</u> it again within a week, &amp; <u>now</u>
       they (the Spr.
      Repub folks) have a <u>right</u> to think I am a d—d,
      colossal &amp; continental liar<sup><a href="#loc.03721_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> (<u>which</u>, en passant, I am
      <u>not</u>.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Now to the point—I <u>feel</u> bound to get up that article PDQ.
   </p>
   
   <p>And I want you to go at it or let me have my <u>MSS</u>. so I can get it off by next <u>Saturday</u> night. This is fair—&amp; I don't want to keep bothering you about it.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am hard at work at the Law—We all enjoyed your Sunday visit—</p>
   
   <p>I 
      wd
      
       feel much encouraged if I 
      cd
      
       hear your gray goose quill was pointing toward Massachussetts

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03721_n2">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | # 328# Mickle St | Camden. It is postmarked: CAMDEN | M[illegible] | 12 | 10[illegible] AM | 1885 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05890_n1">2. James Matlack Scovel's "Walt
      Whitman" finally appeared in the <em>Springfield Republican</em>
      on June 16, 1885—partially authored by Whitman himself and after months of
      negotiating between Scovel and the poet.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0066">3. Henry Ward Beecher (1813–1887), Congregational
      clergyman and brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, accepted the pastorate of the
      Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Whitman described him briefly in the
      Brooklyn <em>Daily Advertiser</em> of May 25, 1850, reprinted in
      <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt Whitman</em>, 2
      vols., ed. by Emory Holloway, I, 234–235; see also <em>I Sit
         and Look Out</em>, 84–85, and Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 1:137–138. His father,
      Lyman Beecher (1775–1863), was also a clergyman, who upon his retirement
      lived with his son in Brooklyn.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03721_n3">4. In the 1884 U.S.
      presidential election, Henry Ward Beecher campaigned for Democrat Grover
      Cleveland and spoke out harshly against Cleveland's opponent, Republican James
      G. Blaine, calling him "the prince of liars."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03721_n4">5. Scovel is alluding here to
      the best known campaign rallying cry against Republican presidential nominee
      James G. Blaine: "Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, continental liar from the
      state of Maine!"<a href="#r5">[back]
