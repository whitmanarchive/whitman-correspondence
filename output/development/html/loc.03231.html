   <p>Will you kindly sign your name well up on the enclosed document,
      close under the print?
   </p>
   
   <p>We already have about 120 authors in this League,<sup><a href="#loc.03231_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> many of
      the best standing &amp; authority. It is meant to take in the whole mass of writers,
      of every worthy kind, &amp; when we have got these we shall enroll the outside
      sympathizers, numbering, I hope, thousands. Ultimately, I believe we shall
      accomplish something.
   </p>

      <br></br>Faithfully yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Parsons Lathrop
      (1851–1898) was an American poet and novelist. For more on him, see <em>The Twentieth Century Biographical Dictionary of Notable
         Americans</em>, ed. Rossiter Johnson and John Howard Brown (Boston:
      Biographical Society, 1904) 360.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03231_n1">1. Lathrop is likely referring
      to the American Copyright League, which he had founded in 1883. The secretary of
      the organization was Robert Underwood Johnson. Aparently, Whitman chose to
      support the cause, as <em>The Publisher's Weekly</em> of January
      26th that year lists him as a "working member" alongside T. W. Higginson,
      William L. Alden, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and John G. Whittier. On this topic,
      see also Martin T. Buinicki, "Walt Whitman and the Question of Copyright," <em>American Literary History</em> 15 (Summer 2003):
      248–275.<a href="#r1">[back]
