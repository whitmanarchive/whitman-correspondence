      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I am always proud to receive any scrap of your handwriting, &amp; pleased as well: 
      tho'
      
       the pleasure was a somewhat melancholy one yesterday, owing to the far
      from favourable account 
      wh.
      
       you give of yourself. It seems a singularly perverse arrangement of nature
      (but <u>you</u> are not the man to complain of her) that you,
      with your exceptionally vigorous mould, &amp; still hardly beginning to be an 
      
      
      
      elderly man, 
      sh.d
      
       be subject to so lingering as well as severe an attack. Believe that you
      have in this country some most sincere sympathizers, to whom news of your complete
      recovery 
      wd
      
       be among the very best news that they 
      cd
      
      hear.
   </p>
   
   <p>I look forward with great interest to your proposed volume of prose &amp; verse. The
      last thing I saw of yours was that temperate &amp; discriminating but yet hearty (or
      it 
      wd
      
       not be yours) estimate of Burns. I put something about it into a literary
      weekly review I write in, The Academy. This was
      copied
      
      
      
      into some (I dare say
      numerous) English papers; and one Editor wrote asking what was the American paper
      in 
      wh.
      
       your remarks had been printed, as he wished to look them up, &amp; reprint
      them in full—
      wh.
      
      has probably been done 
      ere
      
       now. I shall now put into the Academy the substance of your last note,
      &amp; the article in the New Republic. Symonds therein mentioned (at least I suppose
      it is the <u>same</u> Symonds) entered years ago into a
      correspondence with me, on the sole basis of his great admiration of your poems.
      Clifford is regarded as a shining light among our younger
      
      
      
      men of science, very bold in his tone of thought.
   </p>
   
   <p>I forget what the date may have been when I last wrote to you: more shame to me
      perhaps, as showing that it must at any rate have been a long while ago. Perhaps it
      may even have been before May 1873. In that
      month I went to Italy on a short trip with some friends, one of them being the
      daughter, whom I had known from childhood, of one of my oldest intimates Ford Madox
      Brown (a distinguished historical painter—she herself being also a painter of
      no small attainment). Before we came back from 
      
      
      
      the trip, we had resolved that we had
      better part no more, &amp; in March 1874 we married. My wife is greatly interested
      in you &amp; what concerns you, and bids me not fail to say that she "admires you as
      much as I do". I remember that her sister, then perhaps barely 17 years of age,
      seemed more fascinated with your poems, when my selection of them came out towards
      1868, than with any other poetical work she had ever seen. She also is an able
      painter—now married to Dr. Hueffer, a German learned
      in musical &amp; other matters, who has of late contributed some musical articles to
      the N.Y. Tribune. There was also a brother, Oliver Madox Brown, who
      
      
      
      showed a singular extent of genius, both as painter &amp; as writer: a romance of his,
      Gabriel Denver, was published in 1873, &amp; his other remaining writings will probably
      soon be issued. Unfortunately he died in Nov. last of pyaemia, aged less than 20.
      Many a time have I heard him refer to your writings in an enthusiastic spirit.
   </p>
   
   <p> Last month I for the first time in my life faced a public audience (in Birmingham)
      to deliver a lecture—on Shelley: &amp; I found myself less unfitted for the
      task than I had apprehended. It was a <u>written</u> lecture.
      There must be a great 
      
      
      
      satisfaction in addressing a large audience, for one who can speak wholly or almost
      extempore, &amp; who feels the magnetic personal thrill between his hearers &amp;
      himself. You, I think, have on various occasions experienced this pleasure.
   </p>
   
   <p> This afternoon I shall be seeing one of the interesting old men surviving from a
      past generation—Trelawny, the friend of Shelley &amp;
      Byron. He has always been a wonderfully strong man, in all senses of the word: &amp;
      now, well past so, he wears no under-clothing &amp; no great coat, bathes constantly
      in cold water &amp; in the sea, prefers to dispense with stockings as he sits at
      home 
      
      
      slippered—&amp;c. He has been in
      all parts of the world — N. &amp; S. America included: always markedly
      temperate—even in his youth, when the contrary habit was universally
      prevalent here.
   </p>
   
   <p> I hope I have not wearied you with this talk. At all events believe me to be always
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours with affection,
      <br></br>W. M. Rossetti
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Have you wholly relinquished the idea of visiting Europe?</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
