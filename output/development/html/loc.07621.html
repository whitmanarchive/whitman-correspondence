   <p>No word to-day from O'C[onnor]<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> leaving me to gloomy apprehensions—Sunny &amp; warm here &amp; I am expecting an <em>out-door
         chair</em><sup><a href="#loc.03012_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> to get forth in, under Ed's<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> convoy. If the weather keeps good &amp; no
      hitch in my condition, I shouldn't wonder if I got out that way, before you receive
      this—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
