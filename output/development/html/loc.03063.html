      <br xmlns="" class="opener">August 19, 1882.                    
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your card of the 6th, and duly the new edition of the book arrived, for which
      I am much obliged. I have now all the editions, except the second, which I hope to
      possess some day.
   </p> 
   
   <p>The weather has been until yesterday so fearfully oppressive that I have unwittingly
      delayed acknowledging
      
      the book, having been almost sick with the heat. I sent a blast against Comstock,
      to the <u>Tribune</u> on Friday, apropos of his threats in that paper of the 6th, which I suppose you saw.
      They may not print it, or they may tomorrow. Whitelaw Reid being away, is against
      me. We shall see. The article is brief, but a scorcher. I debated before sending it,
      holding your interests in consideration, but 
      
      concluded that Comstock means mischief, and thought prudent to make him feel the talon
      as a warning. If he meddles with your book in New York, I will do my utmost in all
      directions to have him removed from his Post Office Agency, and I think I can raise
      a tempest that will darken him forever, if I try.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is splendid, the way the Rees Welch edition sells. I am delighted.</p>
   
   <p>Much obliged for 
      
      your interest about the Florio Montaigne. I only asked because I saw Welsh dealt in
      old books. There has been a boom in Montaigne of late years, and it is not so easy
      to get hold of the earlier editions now. I have been re-reading him lately. It is
      immense. I can hardly doubt that Bacon is the true authorâ€”the book so fits into his
      scheme. That chapter, "On Some Verses in Virgil", is tremendous, and backs you greatly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thought Gilder of the <u>Critic</u> was a friend of yours. His taking up for that miserable Chadwick against me, misrepresenting
      and falsifying my argumentation, was anything but friendly.
   </p> 
   
   <p>The Unitarian <u>Index</u> did a rascally thing lately in reprinting Chadwick's letter verbatim, without my
      reply. Dr. Channing went up to Boston and saw Underwood, the editor, and 
      
      gave him a piece of his mind (the Dr. thinks it "a crushing reply."). Underwood excused
      himself for not printing my answer on the ground that it was too "personal"!!!!! When
      you remember how Chad. assailed me as a liar, you will appreciate this delicious reason!
      Upon hearing of it, I wrote Underwood a note in which I gave him cantharides, or as
      the Long 
      
      Island boys say, "hell under the shirt". To which he rejoined in a whining letter,
      saying he meant to do me no injustice, and would print a reply from me to Chadwick
      if I would write him one, and make it short! In conclusion, he begged me to remember
      that his paper was "small". To which I had a mind to answer, "Very." But I have not
      again written him, being quite satisfied with letting him know what I thought 
      
      of his fair-play.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dr. Bucke has written me about his book. Can anything be done to make Rees Welsh publish
      it? I wish it could be done. Now is the time, when public interest has been awakened,
      and persecution is yet possible.
   </p>
   
   <p>That is a sick article of Gordon's you sent me. But we'll have something to say on
      that point yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>Goodbye. I hope to hear that the third edition is already called for!</p>

   <p>P.S. I have a card from John Burroughs on his return.</p>
   
   <p>I was sorry to see the item in the Tribune of the 15th, saying that your book had
      been proscribed by Trinity College, Dublin, through the efforts of one Galbraith,
      described as a Fellow of the College, and a damned low fellow too, I should say. The
      news 
      
      made me fear the possible effect here. Strange that I cannot find the alleged letter
      to Marston in any of the Boston papers. It was in Dublin, either at this College or
      the University, that Tyrrell lectured on you, glorifying the book they now proscribe.
      "So runs the world away."
