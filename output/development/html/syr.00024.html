      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> I got your letter of April 12, and since, your postal cards of April 19 and 26
      respectively.<sup><a href="#syr.00024_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Also the envelope containing
      Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup> admirable review of the Longfellow memoir. I have
      been proposing to write to you every day, but it is not easy, I am so poorly. My
      lameness is very bad, and I am very exhausted before many hours pass each day. I
      have piles of unanswered letters. My special trouble now is what they call <u>schlerosis</u>—an induration of the lower part of the
      spinal  cord, a bequest
      of the inflammation caused by the nervous prostration. This it is which makes me so
      lame and strengthless, and unless the doctor can break it up (he is using
      electricity) the result, he tells me, will be paralysis. However, this is some way
      off, and I'm not dead yet! 
   </p> 
   
   <p> John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r4">4</a></sup> has been here, and gives me an account of your
      health, which makes me feel very badly.<sup><a href="#syr.00024_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> He told me
      especially of the trouble I share with you—constipation; and this you <u>must</u> not, Walt, allow to continue. The very worst aperient
      you could use will do you  less harm than constipation. But there are aperients which are harmless, or
      almost nearly so, and I send you a packet of one which answers this description. It
      is known as Liquorice Powder, and is excellent. The dose is one teaspoonful in, say,
      a half goblet of water, when going to bed, to be taken when necessary. You will find
      it
      easy and excellent. It is composed only of powdered liquorice and sulpher, and is
      really without bad effect. Please try it. I have never been troubled with
      costiveness in all my life, but now, like yourself, I have a  partial paralysis of the bowels, and
      must, under medical orders, resort to artificial means, and this is my remedy.
      Anything is better than constipation. The physical feelings it induces are dreadful,
      to say nothing of the constant danger to life. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I was delighted beyond measure at the success of your lecture. I wish I could have
      been there. The account in the <u>Press</u> was splendid. Great are Talcott Williams<sup><a href="#nyp.00459_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> and Thomas Donaldson,<sup><a href="#syr.00024_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup> and
      blessed be their names. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I had a letter from Dr. Bucke at London. He seems to be having a good time. </p>
   
   
   
   <p> I am glad you liked the little book. If I could only have written it over, I would
      have made it fuller and better. But when the time came for publishing, I was too ill
      to write.—I am obliged to you for the notice in the <u>North
         American</u> (G.E.M.). It lets out the delicious fact that White had seen the
      article—probably some magazine that had it, broke faith, and showed it to
      him—and so he got a full excoriation before crossing Styx, for after he died, I
      took out the severest parts from the <u>MS</u>. Big rascal! He
      well  knew the baseness
      of his attack on the <u>Promus</u> book<sup><a href="#n4112" id="r8">8</a></sup>. I have the best of reasons for believing that he
      was secretly a Baconian, but with his editions of Shakespeare, etc., at stake, the
      balance was on the other side of the ledger for him. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am much grieved to learn that Mrs. Pott<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n6" id="r9">9</a></sup> is seriously ill. Nervous prostration.
      Between her tremendous labors on the Bacon subject, her large household duties, and
      her ministrations among the London poor, she has broken down. I feel very anxious
      about her. 
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p> Donnelly's<sup><a href="#n4108" id="r10">10</a></sup> boom increases. There is an article in the 19th Century Magazine on his
      cipher, which will make an excitement and greatly raise his credit. He writes me
      that he expects to be ready to publish by June. 
   </p>
   
   <p> We have had strange weather here. Cold and hot by turns, and rain without stint.
      Did
      you see the electric storm on Saturday night? I never witnessed such magnificent
      lightning. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I hope this will find you in good time. </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0129">4. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="nyp.00459_n4">6.  Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928), a journalist, worked for the New York <em>Sun</em> and <em>World</em>, and became an editorial writer
      on the Springfield <em>Republican</em> in 1879. He joined the
      staff of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1881. In 1912 he
      became director of the School of Journalism at Columbia University. See also
      Elizabeth Dunbar's <em>Talcott Williams: Gentleman of the Fourth
         Estate</em> (1936) and Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906), 1:202. The Philadelphia <em>Press</em> vigorously supported the poet against the Boston
      censorship both in its news columns and in its editorials. A front-page story on
      July 15 quoted at length the defense of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      offered by the Reverend James Morrow, "a prominent Methodist."For more
      information on Talcott Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="syr.00024_n3">7. Thomas Donaldson
      (1843–1898) was a lawyer from Philadelphia and a friend of Whitman. He
      introduced Whitman to Bram Stoker and later accompanied Stoker when he visited
      the poet; he also organized a fund-raising drive to buy Whitman a horse and
      carriage. He authored a biography of Whitman titled <em>Walt
         Whitman, the Man</em> (1896). For more information about Donaldson, see
      Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_111.html">Donaldson, Thomas (1843–1898)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <p id="n4112">8. Francis Bacon's notebook, the <em>Promus of Formularies and Elegancies</em>, was the text that
      was often cited by Baconians as evidence that Bacon was the author of the plays
      attributed to Shakespeare.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03298_n6">9. Constance Mary Fearon Pott
      (1833–1914) started the Francis Bacon Society and, after comparing figures
      of speech in Bacon to Shakespeare, argued for Bacon as the author behind
      Shakespeare's famous plays. O'Connor would later publish <em>Hamlet's Note-Book</em>, subtitled "A defense of Mrs. Henry Pott" (Boston:
      Houghton, Mifflin [1886]).<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="n4108">10. Ignatius Loyola Donnelly
      (1831–1901) was a politician and writer, well known for his notions of
      Atlantis as an antediluvian civilization and for his belief that Shakespeare's
      plays had been written by Francis Bacon, an idea he argued in his book <em>The Great Cryptogram: Francis Bacon's Cipher in Shakespeare's
         Plays</em>, published in 1888.<a href="#r10">[back]
