      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs. O'Connor<sup><a href="#duk.00436_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> writes Mrs. Channing<sup><a href="#loc.01257_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> that you are in New York—I write you, on a forlorn
      hope, to offer you our best welcome if any thing should induce you to turn Eastward.
      We have to offer entertainment, not 
      brillieant
      
      , but quiet &amp; unconstrained. You would find some  few persons here whom I think you would
      like to meet. To balance this on the other side is all New York! All for which I can
      really answer is the sincere desire to see you here in a home-like way– I think we
      have a home that is worth something, &amp; that we gladly open to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>Will you not visit us? </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00436_n3">1. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      was the wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Walt Whitman's
      staunchest defenders. Walt may have mentioned a potential visit by Nelly and her
      daughter during his May visit to Brooklyn, though whether a visit came near this
      time is not known from his or Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters. Walt Whitman
      dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington years, and he spoke
      often in his letters of their daughter Jean (called "Jenny" or "Jeannie").
      Though Whitman and William O'Connor would break off their friendship in late
      1872 over a disagreement about Reconstruction policies and the role of
      emancipated slaves, Nelly would remain friendly with Whitman. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01257_n1">2. Ellen M. O'Connor's sister,
      Mary Jane "Jeannie" (Tarr) Channing (1828–1897). Walt Whitman visited
      often with Mary Jane and her husband Dr. William Ellery Channing during his
      October 1868 visit to Providence, Rhode Island.<a href="#r2">[back]
