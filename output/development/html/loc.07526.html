   <p>I sit here to-day ab't the same—close by fire in my stove, as it is pretty
      cool, though pleasant and sunny—now here laid by in the fifth month—all
      my strength, all <em>bodily-ab't-going-ability</em> quite
      gone—Spend most of the time here in the big ratan-chair—yet good heart
      though (in emotionality &amp; mental action)—no sign either of any change or
      improvement of strength recuperation—But we will see—"(Are we to be
      beaten down this way in our old age"?)

   <p>J B, I hope it is all going well with you—your little visit did me
      good—hope you will write me when you can—W O'C, have been thinking of
      that eye trouble—hope it has gone down or entirely over—Hope this letter
      from Mary Costelloe<sup><a href="#n6109" id="r1">1</a></sup> will interest you<sup><a href="#loc.07526_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Show it to Nelly<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r3">3</a></sup>—in some respects it is a
      woman's letter, but I like it much—Doctor, the photo came this
      forenoon—it is one of the best I ever saw—Can you send one to J B and to
      W O'C?—Some of those photo places off one side appear to make the best
      pictures in the world—My printing matters (or rather <em>binding</em> ones)<sup><a href="#loc.07526_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> go 
      on all right but slowly—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This letter is addressed to
      three close acquaintances of Whitman: the New York naturalist John Burroughs
      (1837–1921), the poet's staunch public defender William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889), and the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke
      (1837–1902). For more on these figures, see these entries from <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n6109">1. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." For more information
      about Costelloe, see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">3. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

      discussions with his publisher David McKay about the preferred binding for <em>November Boughs </em>(1888)<a href="#r4">[back]
