      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend J H J—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>have just heard by Horace traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> that (thro' you) Col.
      Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r3">3</a></sup> favors the idea of a public meeting &amp; address
      ab't me—(get the notion that he has been <em>solicited</em> or
      even <em>persuaded</em>—<em>wh' I don't like at
         all</em>—not warranted or authorized by me, at any rate—but let that
      pass)<sup><a href="#yal.00482_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—If this is so ab't Col. I's design I
      myself think the best place would be New York City, tho' I believe Horace &amp; some
      other friends believe Phila: best—Of course I don't know what Col I's drift
      and vein may be, but I know it w'd be grand, &amp; something I sh'd be proud
      of—On the impulse of the moment I have gather'd these items enclosed &amp;
      send to you, to give all the note (with scraps enclosed all as it is) to Col. I with
      my respects, thanks, &amp; love<sup><a href="#yal.00482_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I shall give the
      whole proposed meeting, address &amp;c: into his and y'r &amp; the friends'
      hands—without any meddling by me—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0839">3. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r3">[back]
