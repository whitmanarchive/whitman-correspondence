      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of yesterday 11th has just this minute come, &amp; I wish to write a few lines so
      that you may get them before Sunday. I have not time to write much, as it is now about
      5 p.
      m. Dear son, I hope you will not feel discouraged at the situation, even if it comes
      to the
      worst. It is now thought that business generally throughout the country is ready to
      revive
      as soon as the hot season is done, &amp; that every thing will be brisker this fall than
      any
      time since the war. Dear Pete, whatever happens, in such ups &amp; downs, you must try
      to
      meet it with a stout heart. As long as the Almighty vouchsafes you health, strength,
      &amp; a
      clear conscience, let other things do their worst—&amp; let Riker<sup><a href="#loc.01526_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> go to hell. You are better off to-day to be what you are, than to
      be him, with his $10,000 a year—poor thin-livered cuss that he is—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My darling son, I will send you $5 every Saturday, should you be idle—as I can easily
      spare that, &amp; you can depend upon it—it wont go far, but it may take the edge off.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many, many loving kisses to you, dear son—for I must close, or I shall lose
      to-night's mail. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
