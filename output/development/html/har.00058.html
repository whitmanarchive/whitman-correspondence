      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still here, &amp; still very much the same as when I last wrote you—have not
      retrograded any, nor had any more of the very bad spells like those in the early part
      of
      October—bodily strength is certainly better—
      dont
      
       so easily tire, &amp; give out—locomotion still very bad—&amp;
      head not <em>out of the woods</em> yet—but spirits &amp; feelings
      pretty good—I have sent you the Graphic, with piece by me, about the Capitol,
      which I suppose you rec'd—also same paper with my portrait &amp; criticism by
      "Matador"<sup><a href="#har.00058_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I have rec'd a letter lately from
      Eldridge—nothing new at Washington, in my affairs—Mrs. O'Connor was to
      return last Tuesday—I have written a couple of new poems, which I have sold to a
      magazine &amp; got the money for—I think one will appear in January number—I
      will leave you to guess the magazine—How are you getting along? How is
      'Sula?—Love to both of you—I am writing this up in my room—it is
      growing dark—I am going out to tea, to an acquaintance here—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="har.00058_n1">1. The review of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> by "Matador," claiming that "it takes
      seven years to learn to appreciate Walt Whitman's poetry," appeared with a
      portrait of Whitman in the New York <em>Daily Graphic</em> on
      November 25, 1873, the day after Whitman's "Halls of Gold and Lilac" appeared in
      the same newspaper.<a href="#r1">[back]
