   <p>Give my regards to Mr. Forman and tell him that I have nothing definite to say at
      the present about an English ed. of my poems, but I will keep it in mind and will keep him in mind in connection with
      it. Perhaps next summer I shall have something definite to say about it. Just now
      I do not think anything can be done. Tell him also that [what] I have to say about
      the English Ed. will be first presented to him. I have many friends in England but he will be the
      first consulted.
