   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00605_n5">1. This letter dates to October
      7, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter September 30, 1871, and Edwin
      Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:369). Bucke's and Miller's date is incorrect because the letter states that
      the "green porters has left early this morning." The "green porters" are the
      family of Mary (Whitman) Van Nostrand, who lived in Greenport, Long Island. In
      late September 1871, Louisa's daughter Mary, Mary's husband Ansel, and their two
      daughters Louisa and Mary Isadore "Minnie" came to Brooklyn and shopped in
      preparation for Minnie's marriage. This letter must follow Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman, in which
      she reported that her "company is here yet and i dont know how long they will
      remain." Since Louisa did not mention the Van Nostrands in her  letter to Walt, this letter dates
      to the Saturday between the October 5 and the October 10 letters, October 7,
      1871.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n16">2. Walt Whitman was an
      enthusiastic reader of the novelist George Sand. He favorably reviewed <em>Le Compagnon du Tour de France</em> (1840) in Francis George
      Shaw's English translation, <em>The Journeyman Joiner: or the
         Companion of the Tour of France</em> (1847). Walt counted both Sand's <em>Consuelo</em> (1845) and her <em>La Comtesse de
         Rudolstadt</em> (1845) among his favorite novels (see K. H. Francis, "Walt
      Whitman's French," <em>Modern Language Review</em> 51:4 [1956],
      504). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman shared her son's enthusiasm for Sand. Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman had sent this request to his brother Walt a decade
      earlier: "Mother wants me to be sure and tell you that you must bring her one of
      those books by the authoress of 'Consuelo'" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt). The Sand title that Walt forwarded in
      October 1871 is not known.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n4">3. The "green porters" are
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's elder daughter Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van Nostrand
      (1821–1899), Mary's husband Ansel Van Nostrand, and two of their
      daughters, Louisa and Mary Isadore "Minnie" (1851–1938). Louisa announced
      their arrival with "bag and baggage" in her  letter to Walt Whitman. The shopping trip, which relied on
      Louisa's Brooklyn residence as a home base, was in preparation for Minnie's
      marriage to Leander Jay Young (1846–1937) on October 18, 1871 (see
      Gertrude A. Barber, compiler, "Marriages of Suffolk County, N. Y. Taken from the
      'Republican Watchman': A Newspaper Published at Greenport, N. Y. Years 1871,
      1872, 1873, 1874, 1875, 1876." [1950], 1:3). For Louisa's anxiety regarding the
      impending visit and the extended stay, see her  letter to Walt. For more on the Van Nostrand family,
      see Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n11">5. The American Institute was
      a long-running Brooklyn fair that displayed flowers, plants, fruits, and
      products of American industry and manufacture. The fair buildings, which
      occupied 100,000 square feet, were located on the block enclosed by Second and
      Third Avenue and Sixty-third and Sixty-fourth Street (<em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, September 14, 1871, 1). Walt Whitman opened the American
      Institute on September 7, 1871, with a recitation of "After All, Not to Create
      Only." The poem was widely reprinted (see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/index.html">"Poems in Periodicals"</a> and Whitman's  draft letter to the American Institute Committee on
      Invitations).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n12">7. The man accompanying Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman has not been identified. He may be a member of the St. Louis
      Water Works Board of Water Commissioners (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">8. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n1">9. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      letter from Julia Hine, widow of Charles Hine, is not extant. Charles Hine was
      an artist, and he had died on July 31, 1871, only days after a visit by Walt
      Whitman. Hine's painting of the poet was the model for the engraving that became
      the frontispiece for <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1860 (see Walt
      Whitman's July 14, 1871 letter to Charles Hine, <em>The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Ted Genoways [Iowa City: University of Iowa Press,
      2004], 7:31; and see <em>Connecticut, Deaths and Burials Index,
         1650–1934</em> [Salt Lake City: FamilySearch, 2009]). Julia Hine
      indicated her plan to visit Walt's mother in Brooklyn in an  letter to Walt. After Julia Hine's
      earlier visit, Louisa wished she had been able to give her money (see Louisa's
       letter to Walt).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n13">10. The poem that Walt Whitman
      sent is not known. Julia Hine in her  letter to Walt Whitman explained that she would have difficulty
      caring for three children because her financial means have been exhausted by her
      husband's illness and death. She asked Whitman if he could assist her to find
      copying work. She also wrote, "Mr. Townsend, a dear friend of Charley's, has
      sent you a paper with a pleasant article written by himself." The review of
      Whitman's work by a Townsend in a Providence, Rhode Island, newspaper has not
      been identified.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n4">11. Tom Rome (b. 1836) was a
      printer with A. H. Rome and Brothers, later Rome Brothers. His brother Andrew
      Rome, a friend of Walt Whitman, printed the first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1855. See Ed Folsom, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html"><em>Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</em></a> (University of Iowa: Obermann Center for Advanced
      Studies, 2005).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00605_n8">12. The final four words of
      the letter are written in the right margin.<br><br>
      Tom Rome married Agnes Rogerson (b. 1848) in 1871 (see <em>United States Census, 1900</em>). According to a genealogy prepared by
      John Malcom MacDonald, Agnes Rogerson, born in Annan, Dumfriesshire,
      Scotland, married Tom Rome on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn, on September 11,
      1871 (MacDonald/Rome/Reardon/Coleman/Smith/Stevens/Lanning/Novak,
