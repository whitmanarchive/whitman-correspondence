      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In answer to your note I send enclosed a copy of my poem for Tuft's College on the
      17th—which you are at liberty to publish on the 18th.<sup><a href="#prc.00094_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      I am not well enough to journey to College Hill, but have sent the piece &amp; requested
      that it be read in its place on the programme, 17th, exactly the same as though I
      were
      present—which doubtless will be done.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward P. Clark was the
      managing editor of the Springfield <em>Republican</em>. He appears
      to have written, in a letter now lost, to Whitman to request permission to
      publish the poem, "Song of the Universal," which Whitman was originally
      scheduled to deliver before the Mathematician Society of Tufts College on June
      17. See the letter from Whitman to J. C. Mann of .
