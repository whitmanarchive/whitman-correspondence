      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent my article on you to Walsh<sup><a href="#n4283" id="r1">1</a></sup> some weeks ago—have not heard from him but assume he will use it
      soon. I will write him again if I do not hear this week. I thought it but fair that
      he should print an authentic report he has printed so many that were not true.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very busy lecturing and writing now. I want to get out a volume of stories this
      fall—stories illustrative of the west and of social injustice. I am now
      bargaining with Roberts bros. thereto.<sup><a href="#loc.02137_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am also writing dramas—my fourth and last is praised highly by practical
      managers and by literary critics.<sup><a href="#loc.02137_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I<sup><a href="#loc.02137_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
      shall try to bring that out next spring—
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you my photo—it may be of interest to you—I had just been
      lecturing upon your prose and the book in my hand is "Specimen Days."<sup><a href="#n4121" id="r5">5</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hamlin Garland
      (1860–1940) was an American novelist and autobiographer, known especially
      for his works about the hardships of farm life in the American Midwest. For his
      relationship to Whitman, see Thomas K. Dean, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_190.html">Garland, Hamlin</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4283">1. William S. Walsh (1854–1919)
      was an American author and editor of <em>Lippincott's Monthly
         Magazine</em>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02137_n2">2. Garland's <em>Main-Travelled Roads: Six Mississippi Valley Stories</em> was published in
      1891 by the Arena Publishing Company, Boston.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02137_n3">3. Garland's fourth drama is
      not extant. Fragments of three plays are held in the Hamlin Garland Collection
      at the University of Southern California. He published only one play, entitled
      "Under the Wheel: A Modern Play in Six Scenes." It appeared in Benjamin Orange
      Flower's magazine <em>Arena</em> 2 (July 1890), 182–228. It
      was also published as a book: <em>Under the Wheel</em> (Boston:
      Barta Press, 1890).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02137_n4">4. Garland concludes his letter by writing
      the rest at an angle on the verso of the first page.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4121">5. The first issue of Whitman's <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> was published by the
      Philadelphia firm of Rees Welsh and Company in 1882. The second issue was
      published by David McKay. Many of the autobiographical notes, sketches, and
      essays that focus on the poet's life during and beyond the Civil War had been
      previously published in periodicals or in <em>Memoranda During the
         War</em> (1875–1876).
