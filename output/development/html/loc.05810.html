      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I wrote to you some time ago, but receiving no answer fear my letter must have
      miscarried. The subject of it was to request permission to use a selection from
      your poems in a collection of choice [
      <span class="unclear">extracts?</span>]
       from American Literature which I am
      preparing. 
   </p>
   
   <p> The title of my work will be, "Half Hours with the Best American Authors," and
      it will be confined to the writings of those who have or are likely to have a
      just claim to be included in this category. 
   </p>
   
   <p> In such a work a selection form your writings is highly desirable, and the one
      which I desire to use is the poem entitled "The Song of the Redwood Tree." 
   </p>
   
   <p> I should be glad to have your permission to use this selection, and of course
      will make the usual acknowledgement of its source. 
   </p>
   
   <p> An early answer will much oblige.<sup><a href="#loc.05810_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <p>I had a conversation yesterday with your publisher D McKay, who freely gave
      me permission to extract from another work on his list. My work will be in 4
      volumes, and published in creditable style.

   A hielan' lad my lo' was born
   <br>The lowland laws he held in scorn
   <br>But he still was faithful to his clan
   <br>My gallant, braw John Hie'landman
   <br>
   
   
   
   <br>Wi his philabeg an' tartan plain
   <br>And guid claymore down at his side
   <br>The ladies' hearts he did trepan
   <br>My gallant braw John Hielandman
   <br>
   
   
   
   <br>Sing hey, my braw John Hie'lan'man
   <br>Sing ho, my braw John Hie'lan'man
   <br>There's not a lad in all the lan'
   <br>Can match with my John Hie'lan'man
