   <p>I have your fine long welcome letter of 24th I am glad the
      big book<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r2">2</a></sup> keeps moving—I hope you will hit on a good picturesque,
      characteristic cover for it—this will be <u>the</u> book of
      the future and should not be too commonplace in any way. The cover of the '60–1 ed.
      might be taken as a point to start from—with some modification, perhaps toning
      down, that cover (the style of it) would not do badly. I have written a line to
      Garland<sup><a href="#loc.02128_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—his column in the Transcript<sup><a href="#loc.07273_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> was
      admirable. Nothing new from Wm Gurd,<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      expect him here very soon, then as soon as we can get Canadian and European patents
      secured we shall go East.  I am uneasy about O'Connor,<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> if you hear from him let me know
      how he is—I am afraid he is not doing well—wish I could see him.
   </p>
   
   <p>Remember me to Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r7">7</a></sup> tell him that every thing goes
      quietly along here since he left us
   </p>
   
   <p>The weather is stupid this morning (dull &amp; heavy) and I think I am a little
      stupid myself—nothing very wonderful if I am
   </p>
   
   <p>Shall soon write again</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4151">2. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

   <p id="n4284">5. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
