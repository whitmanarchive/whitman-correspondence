      <br></br>Providence, R.I.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">April 1, 1883.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I got your letter of the 29th, and in the afternoon of the same day (March 30) the
      package of books came. It was very kind in you to send
      them. As Dr. Channing's family are ardent friends of you
      and your book, and have no recent issues, I turned over to them one copy of the
      poems and the copy of "Specimen Days"—you know I have both myself ("Specimen
      Days," I regret to say, I have never found time to read, but shall, from the copy
      you
      sent me, when I return to Washington, 
      
      as I shall have more leisure this spring and
      summer than I had in the dreadful months of labor when the book came.) The other
      copy of the poems, I shall reserve for some one who shall prove to be worthy: and
      I
      hope this disposition of your kind gift will please you.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Channing family are staunch adherents, and the girls (Mary and Grace—Mary
      was recently married and is living in Cambridge—) both gave their cousin, Col.
      Higginson, (whom I have gone for so savagely in the
      Introductory) a round talking-to on your account, apropos of his article in <u>The
         Woman's Journal</u>. But Higginson is incorrigible. 
      
      I imagine, however, that the
      rhinosceros spear I have planted and turned by steam in his hide (in the
      Introductory) will startle his supercilious composure, especially what I say about
      his Port Royal experience, and I guess he will be mad as a wet hen. All right:
      people that live in porcelain towers or crystal palaces, shouldn't throw stones at
      the "lower <u>h</u>orders," such as we are,—we whose armorial legend is "'eave 'arf
      a brick at 'im!"
   </p>
   
   <p>It was very kind to send Karl Elze's book, which I have read
      (you know I am a very rapid reader) and will return 
      
      to you by express. I knew him
      already by his life of Byron, which I own, and the best thing
      in which is his perfectly exterminating analysis of Mrs Stowe's (or rather Lady Byron's) ridiculous slander. Otherwise in this Byron book, as in
      the one on Shakespeare, he is a perfect Bismarck phillistine,
      with a head of wood just larded with brains. The lack of political freedom, inducing
      proclivity to aristocratic ideas, and utter lack of sympathy with democratic or
      republican thought, makes all the Germans, even the great ones, (and Elze is not
      great), perfectly worthless whenever they approach topics connected with 
      
      the
      questions of liberty and humanity; and Shakespeare cannot be successfully approached
      in criticism except in connection with the mighty human movement which made the life
      of his age—"the world-bettering age," as one of the great Elizabethan men
      calls it. Hence this supper of sawdust, such as 
      Carl
      
       Elze and others like him, sets for us. A dull fellow, moreover, which
      only partly accounts for his slurring notice of Hugo's magnificent book on
      Shakespeare—Bismarckism being accountable for the rest of it. However, what
      paralyzes all Shakespearean criticism, Elze's, as well as the rest, is the
      
      obstinate
      consideration of the work with that Stratford chucklehead and his chucklehead
      biography. If we had no notion whatever of the author, we should fare better in
      understanding the work than we do with William Shakespeare on our brains like an
      incubus. To know a man is to know his book. To be dead sure in advance that Barnum
      wrote <u>Hamlet</u> and <u>The Tempest</u>, is to be dead sure of knowing little or nothing of
      those works forever.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have heard nothing yet about the Heywood trial. You and
      McKay
      <u>did perfectly right</u> in keeping aloof and not contributing
      
      to
      the defence. Your connection could not help him and might hurt you. "Against
      stupidity the gods themselves are powerless," says Euripides, and Heywood is
      certainly a champion jackass. I am sorry for him, but his bed is his own making, and
      he should have known what Comstock could do to him if he advertised war on the
      ovaries. I only hope we shall escape the consequences of his folly.
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose the correction has been made, but I noticed in Bucke's
      Latin motto the error of the diphthong œ (in the fourth line) in the word
      præclarius. It should be æ (AE), not œ. Munro spells it <u>praeclarius</u>, not
      using 
      
      the diphthong character at all, which is sensible.—It is a glorious
      epigraph.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just been down to the Post Office, and got your letter of yesterday, but not the revise, which will not come until tomorrow
      morning. I am rejoiced at what you say of my contribution, but feel <u>dreadfully</u> at the prospect your letter opens, of my
      paragraphing being changed. I could bear with equanimity anything but
      that—especially the breaking up of my running account of the great books into
      paragraphs. <u>That</u> I never can like. The effect will be
      horrible. Besides, you told me I was to have my way.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will write you again after 
      
      I get the revise. <u>I expect to leave here tomorrow
         evening and arrive in Washington on Tuesday afternoon:</u> so unless you hear to the
      contrary, address me at the Office of the Life Saving Service, as usual.
   </p>
   
   <p>I leave heavy-hearted, for Jeannie is very feeble, and I fear the worst. Yet I must go on to Washington, even if I have to return
      again. I can only hope that she will revive as the days go on (illness has its ebbs
      and flows) and be able to journey home. At present, she is too ill and 
      
      weak to leave
      her bed.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall probably return you the revise from Washington, though I may be able to look
      over it before I leave, if I get it tomorrow morning. Thanks to Protestantism,
      Sunday knocks post office usages endways. The post office can only be open for an
      hour on God's day, so that I get your letter, but not the proof, there not being time
      for the officials to overhaul postal matter of the second or third or fourth class
      until Monday!
   </p>
