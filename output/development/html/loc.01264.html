      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Child
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your kind letter of June 25th—you say:</p>
   
   
   <p>"I hope you rec'd the a/c of your doings &amp; saying at Alfred Tennyson's son's wedding, which I sent
      you some time ago."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No, I did not receive any such acc't, &amp; I cannot tell what you mean, or what occurr'd—If convenient tell me—</p>
   
   
   <p>Ab't the <u>London Times</u>' comments on Mr Bryant's death (American poetry, with something about me, as I understand)
      I wish you had sent it me—as I have not seen or heard of it<sup><a href="#loc.01264_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I live very quietly here—am at present pretty well, considering, go about daily.
      Keep cheery, but remain a partial paralytic—I have now an edition of my works in Two
      Volumes (see Circular herewith) which I have got out here &amp; job &amp; sell <u>myself</u>—(as the publishers positively wont publish me &amp; my agents here in New York during
      1873 '4 &amp; '5 regularly embezzled the proceeds)<sup><a href="#loc.01264_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I only print small editions, &amp; the price is very high, $5 a Vol::—but they sell moderately well—it all gives me something to do—&amp; 
      
      
      then the income supports me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If Trübner &amp; Co: should wish any, the price would be $3.50 a Vol:<sup><a href="#loc.01264_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I send you a copy of <u>Two Rivulets</u>, as a little present, with my best regards—Any thing you meet alluding to me, or
      criticizing, or that you think will interest me, send me, my friend, when convenient
      (any <u>real</u> thing—of course don't bother about the flippant &amp; pointless)—Address as at the top
      of this letter—I find the P O here entirely reliable—
