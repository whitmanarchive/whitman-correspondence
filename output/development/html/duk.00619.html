   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00619_n12">1. This letter dates to March
      24, 1873. Edwin Haviland Miller dated this letter March 23?, 1873 (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:370). However, the word "monday" is in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's hand, and March 23, 1873 fell on a Sunday. Louisa wrote that
      she had received a letter (not extant) from "one of mattees dear freends."
      Louisa also wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman on March
      22–24?, 1873 (not extant) upon receipt of the letter from Mattie's friend,
      and Jeff with his March 26, 1873 reply acknowledged Louisa's letter and included
      a cryptic note about Mattie's friend, who was named "Mrs. O'Rielly [<em>sic</em>]" (see Jeff Whitman's March 26, 1873 letter to Louisa
      Whitman in Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear
         Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
      State University Press, 1984], 164; 164, n. 2). Because Louisa dated the letter
      "monday" and March 24 was the only Monday that fell between the letter from Mrs.
      O'Reilly to Louisa and Jeff's March 26 reply to Louisa's letter, this letter
      must date to March 24, 1873.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n9">2. Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman,
      George Washington Whitman's wife, had made a trip to Philadelphia, and George
      had traveled to Brooklyn to seek a job inspecting pipe (see Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n13">3. The letter that Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman has received from Walt Whitman is not his  letter, to which Louisa responded directly in her  letter to Walt. Therefore, Walt
      Whitman's March 22 or 23?, 1873 letter to Louisa is not extant but was not noted
      by Miller (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:363).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n11">4. Walt Whitman in January
      1873 suffered a paralytic stroke that initially confined him to bed: it took
      weeks before he could resume walking. He first reported the stroke to his mother
      in his  letter and continued
      regularly to report his condition in subsequent letters. Helen Price inquired
      anxiously about Walt's health and wrote that his illness had been reported in
      the papers (see her January 31, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Trent
      Collection, Duke University). Anna Van Wyck's  letter to Louisa also noted that Walt's stroke was reported
      in the <em>New York Herald</em> (Library of Congress, Feinberg
      Collection). Anna Van Wycke had boarded with the Whitmans in Brooklyn, and the
      Van Wyck family farm was near Colyer farm, which had belonged to Jesse Whitman,
      Walt Whitman's paternal grandfather. See Bertha H. Funnel, <em>Whitman on Long Island</em> (Port Washington, New York: Kennikat Press,
      1971), 78.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00616_n4">5. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) died on February 19, 1873 from complications
      associated with a throat ailment that had first been noted by her husband Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in February 1863. Mattie and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. The letters after Mattie's death show that
      emotional acceptance of the fact was difficult for Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.
      For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26. Waldron reports that a physician identified the cause
      of death as cancer (3). Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's accompanying
      bronchial symptoms may have been associated with tuberculosis (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008], 78–79).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n7">6. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's effort to explain the letter that Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
      received from a "stranger" caused him considerable unease. In his reply to this
      letter, Jeff referred to the "stranger" as "Mrs. O'Rielly [<em>sic</em>]" and explained who she was—or, rather, explained not
      explaining who she was in his letter—with a cryptic remark: "in regard to
      this I must say to you that though I cannot tell you in a letter in regard to
      why the letters are silent in regard to her I can and will explain the matter."
      Jeff's odd repetition of "regard" led editors Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M.
      Price to conjecture that he "clearly intends to hide something" (see Jeff's
      March 26, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in Berthold and Price, ed.,
      <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 164; 164, n.
      2). For more on Mrs. O'Reilly and for additional insistence that Louisa keep the
      matter of her letter quiet, see Jeff Whitman's April 24, 1873 letter to Louisa
      (Berthold and Price, 166–167; 167, n. 3).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n14">7. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. He married wife Martha Mitchell
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," in 1859, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had
      shared their Brooklyn residence until Jeff departed for St. Louis. Mattie and
      her two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa, joined Jeff in St. Louis in
      early 1868. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n3">8. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00619_n6">9. Jessie Louisa "Sis" Whitman
      (1863–1957) was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman,
      Walt Whitman's brother, and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Jessie
      Louisa inherited the nickname "Sis" after older sister Manahatta became "Hattie"
      and was sometimes called "Duty," but Walt often called her by the nickname
      "California." <a href="#r9">[back]
