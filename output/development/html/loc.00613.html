      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman
      <br></br>My Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your kind favor of the 11th inst came duly to hand, and was followed next day by your
      copy of "Drum Taps." Accept of my thanks for both it was more certainly than I could
      expect from a comparative stranger to me.â€”and yet not a stranger, for I am hailed
      as a <em>soldier</em> and <em>comrade</em> there is the link
      that binds me to you in a bond of unity and good feeling. May it never be severed
      by an 
      unloyal
      
       act of mine, let our password be "Goodwill," and when called upon to sunder
      all earthly ties, when the last "long roll" is called in which there will be no
      "missing" may we be found in the ranks of the Captain of our Salvation, ready to enter
      upon an eternity of bliss and where parting is no more.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall be pleased to see you when in our city, and in anything that I can contribute
      to
      your happiness in all things command me.
   </p>

      With Many Regards, Respectfully Yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thompson was perhaps H. B. Thompson, who also
      signs his name "Thomson." He wrote to Walt Whitman on : "You will not remember the writer of this letter. ...
      I wont forget Walt Whitman. I have just read that you have completed your half
      century. May you live to a ripe old age, loving and beloved. I was reading 'Drum
      Taps' last night, no man can depict Army life so vividly that had not spent his
      time amongst the boys." A Sergeant Hugh B. Thomson was enlisted the Third
      Company of the Seventh Regiment of New York during the Civil War.
