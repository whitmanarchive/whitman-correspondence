      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Have time &amp; its influences at least helped to calm the terrible loss &amp; shock
      &amp; dislocation? Have you got so that letters and all outside news are <em>not</em>
      altogether painful intrusions? Hoping so I send just a line. (For a while I thought
      it must be some false report—I was in Boston at the time—&amp; waited
      &amp; waited until confirmed.)<sup><a href="#pml.00051_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I am as well as any of late years—or perhaps better. My brother &amp; sister
      are well. The Staffords the same. I am writing this in the sunshine up in my old 3d
      story room—Best best love to you &amp; to Herby &amp; Grace—
   </p>

   <p>I send a <em>Ledger</em> with Arthur Peterson's<sup><a href="#pml.00051_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> letter—

   <p id="pml.00051_n1">1. This letter bears the
      address: Mrs Anne Gilchrist | Keats Corner 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London |
      England. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Nov | 28 | Pa.; London | CM | De 10 |

   <p id="pml.00051_n2">2. Whitman was referring to
      the suicide of Beatrice Gilchrist. On 
      Anne Gilchrist replied to Whitman: "Your welcome letter to hand. I have longed
      for a word from you—could not write myself—was stricken
      dumb—nay, there is nothing but silence for me still." The intensity of her
      grief is visible in the lines of an undated and unsigned letter: "My dear
      Children, you would not wish me to live if you knew how I suffered. Not grief
      alone—that I could learn to bear, to be resigned—but
      remorse—that I should have left her; that is like an envenomed wound
      poisoning all my life. 'Weighed &amp; found wanting' am I. And there where I
      thought myself surest. O the love for her shut up in my heart" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). Probably Anne had encouraged Beatrice to abandon
      medicine (see the letter from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of ). Whitman apparently did not reply
      to Anne Gilchrist's letter of June 17, in which she apologized for not
      remembering his birthday: "it was past &amp; I had not written one
      word—not just put my hand in yours as I would fain always do on that day."
      In the same letter she invited the poet to visit her: "a snug bed-room ready
      &amp; waiting for you—as long as ever you will stay with us" (Walt Whitman
      Collection, 1842–1957, Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, University of
      Pennsylvania).<a href="#r2">[back]
