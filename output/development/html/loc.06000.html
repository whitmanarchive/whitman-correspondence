   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.06000_n1">1. To Horace Traubel, Whitman
      would say about this rejection: "There's a kick: don't you call that a kick? . .
      . I suppose I'm thin-skinned too, sometimes: I never get it quite clear in my
      old head that I am not popular and if editors have any use for me at all it can
      only be among the minor figures of interest. I do not rank high in market
      valuations—at the best I am only received on sufferance: I have not yet
      really got beyond the trial stage" (<em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.47.html">Thursday, August 30, 1888</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
