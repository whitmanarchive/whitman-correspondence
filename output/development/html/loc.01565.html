      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend Hiram,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter of 27th May<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup> has come safe to hand, &amp; I was truly glad to hear from you. 
      Hiram, you must not think I have forgotten you, for I have thought of you too 
      many times since the days we used to see each other there in the Hospital. 
      Lewis Brown is well. I see him often. He has a place here as Clerk, at $1200 a year.
      
      He is in the 4th Auditor's Office, Treasury Department, &amp; that is his address. 
      Did you know Adrian Bartlett—in Ward K? He is also a clerk in 4th Auditor's. 
      Thompson,<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> the one so low with diarrhea, went home to New Jersey, 
      &amp; I have never heard from him since. Taber was killed in one of the Battles of the
      Wilderness. 
      Shot in the head &amp; fell instantly. Tom Sawyer, (Lewy Brown's friend), 
      passed safe through the war—but we have not heard from him now for two years. 
      Dr. Bliss is practising here in Washington. Dr Bowen<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> also. Old Armory Square 
      is now used as an Army Clothing depot. Of course all the big hospitals are 
      long broken up—there now remain only the Post Hospital, U. S. A. on K st. 
      &amp; two or three small regimental hospitals in &amp; around the city.<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n6" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As to me &amp; my fortunes I am in pretty good health, thank God—&amp; I am working in the
      Attorney General's office (as the heading of this letter.)
      It is an easy kind of place—the other clerks are all young men, friendly 
      &amp; jovial—So I have things pleasant enough. The pay is 1000 a year.<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n7" id="r5">5</a></sup></p> 
   
   
   <p>Miss Lowell<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n8" id="r6">6</a></sup> is still around—is interested in the African schools. 
      Lewy Brown has just been in to see me—he says he wrote two letters 
      &amp; wrote to your mother—Joe Harris often asks for you &amp; is doing well—is in the State
      Office—Mrs &amp; Miss Martins are well.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Curly, at last accounts, was home in Ohio. Cate is home in New Hampshire—he has been
      committing matrimony—&amp; is now supposed to be suffering 
      the consequences—poor reckless young man—Mrs. Wright<sup><a href="#loc.01565_n9" id="r7">7</a></sup> is at Flushing, L. I., New York. She is in the Soldiers' orphan home.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Hiram, you ought to have put in your letter how you got along with your leg since,
      
      &amp; how you are now in health, &amp; how you are situated. 
      I want to hear all about you generally—all the particulars.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well I believe that is all this time. I send you my love, dear friend 
      &amp; soldier, &amp; I hope this will find you well in health &amp; in good spirits. 
      So God bless you, boy, &amp; for the present I must bid you Farewell—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Hiram Sholes lay next to Brown
      in Armory Square Hospital, according to Sholes's letter to Walt Whitman on May
      24, 1867 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection); see also "Letter from Walt Whitman to
      Hiram Sholes, May 30, 1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      1:331–332). Charles I. Glicksberg, ed., (<em>Walt Whitman
         and the Civil War</em> [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,
      1933], 155) records: "Hiram Scholis—bed 3—Ward E.—26th N. York—wants some
      pickles—a bottle of pickles.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01565_n3">1. Walt Whitman was in
      error: Sholes's letter was dated May 24.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01565_n4">2. Perhaps H. B. Thompson,
      who wrote to Walt Whitman on : "You
      will not remember the writer of this letter.…I wont forget Walt Whitman. I
      have just read that you have completed your half century. May you live to a ripe
      old age, loving and beloved. I was reading 'Drum Taps' last night, no man can
      depict Army life so vividly that had not spent his time amongst the
      boys."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01565_n5">3. Dr. Charles H. Bowen was
      a Washington physician.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01565_n6">4. This sentence was lined
      through.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01565_n7">5. This is an error.
      According to his  letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Walt Whitman's salary was $1,600, and he later
      received a "20 percent addition" (see Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). Perhaps Walt Whitman sensed
      that Sholes was about to ask for a loan due to his poor economic lot.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01565_n8">6. In his  letter to Walt Whitman, Alonzo S.
      Bush, a soldier, referred to Anna Lowell, a nurse during the war in Armory
      Square Hospital: "Tell Miss Lowell that her Kindness to the Solders 
      undr
      
       her charge While I was there I never Shall forget."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01565_n9">7. Mrs. H. J. Wright was a
      nurse during the Civil War at the Mansion House Hospital in Alexandria, Virginia
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #104). In  published in
      the <em>New-York Times</em> on March 6, 1865, Walt Whitman wrote:
      "I have known her for over two years in her labors of love." The passage
      referring to her did not appear with the rest of the article in <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html">Specimen Days</a></em>.<a href="#r7">[back]
