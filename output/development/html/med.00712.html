   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00712_n1">1. In an undated entry but
      written about December 28, Whitman recorded the receipt of $50 from Johnston
      "for portrait—now paid in full, $200" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). During
      the year Hannah Heyde had been seriously ill, emotionally more than physically.
      Heyde wrote on , , , and  to inform Whitman of his wife's
      breakdown, to complain of the additional burdens he had to assume, and to ask
      for money. Whitman sent $20 to Hannah on October 17, $20 to Heyde on November
      13, and $10 to his sister on December 23 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On
      December 19–20, he wrote in his Commonplace Book: "gloomy news from dear
      sister Hannah—letter worse than ever from the wretched cur, C L H[eyde]."
      On , Heyde informed Whitman that
      Hannah's "disorder is mental, beyond medical aid." Heyde continued to complain
      of medical bills and to pity himself; obviously he expected more financial aid
      than he received from Whitman or from George.<a href="#r1">[back]
