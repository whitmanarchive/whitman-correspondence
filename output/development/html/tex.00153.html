      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wrote you yesterday, (Monday,) which I suppose you rec'd, with the money. I have
      just heard from Han, &amp; I write to-day because I knew it would be a comfort to you
      to know right away. Heyde has just sent me a letter—he seems to be in a very good
      humor—writes a lot of stuff—but <em>not</em> about domestic affairs this time—on "poetry" &amp; "criticism" &amp;c. &amp;c—of no interest
      at all to me—then at the close of the letter he says:
   </p>
   
   <p>"Han is much better than usual, &amp; is constantly promising to write to her mother."<sup><a href="#tex.00153_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I send you the part of the N. Y. Times, containing a good long piece about
      me. It is the N. Y. Daily Times, of Sunday, Dec 2—but perhaps George or Jeff brought
      it to you last Sunday.
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel pretty well generally—with now &amp; then a poorish spell—</p>
   
   <p>I am going to hear the great actress Ristori<sup><a href="#tex.00153_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to-morrow night. One of my fellow clerks has taken a seat for me, &amp; made me a present
      of it—the play is "Queen Elisabeth"—I wish you &amp; Mat could go with me—
   </p>
   
   <p>The piece in the <em>Times</em> is by O'Connor.<sup><a href="#tex.00153_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> He grows stronger &amp; stronger, &amp; fiercer &amp; fiercer in his championship of "Leaves
      of Grass"—no one can ever say a word against it in his presence, without a storm.
      Did you get the "Galaxy" of Dec 1—?
   </p>
   
   <p>William Swinton<sup><a href="#tex.00153_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here in Washington, temporarily. He is interested in speculating in gold. It is
      very fine weather here to-day. I am writing this by my big window, where I can look
      out on the water—the sun is shining bright as silver.

         Times</em>. His hostility to Union generals and his unscrupulous tactics led

      opinion of William's journalism; see his letter from . He was professor of English at the University of
      California from 1869 to 1874. Thereafter he compiled extremely successful
      textbooks, and established the magazine <em>Story-Teller</em>, in
      1883. He was the brother of John Swinton, managing editor of the <em>New York Times</em>; see the letter of  from Walt Whitman to John Swinton.
