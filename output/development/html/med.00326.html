      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>The books are duly delivered. The publishers and printers deserve high praise for
      the superb manner in which they have done their work. For the poet, he shall hear
      from me next week. Meanwhile I am up to my eyes—and over my eyes even to blindness—in
      the slough of a fearful road to that great castle "success" which looms up in the
      dim religious distance, and from which white-winged angels, peopling every turret,
      beckon me with many colored banners. In plainer English I am fighting like a thousand
      Humans to establish the Saturday Press, and have for my almost only encouragement
      the cheering words of warm and appreciating friends who alas (as in such cases made
      and provided) have nothing but words to give, and also the printer will not be paid
      in words though they are "like apples of gold in pictures of silver." As for you,
      success is certain. It is written all over the book. There is an aroma about it that
      goes right to the soul.
   </p>  
   
   <p>What I can do for it, in the way of bringing it before the public, over and over again,
      I shall do, and do thoroughly—if the S.P. is kept alive another month. We have more
      literary influence than any other paper in the land, and as your poems are not new
      to me, I can say it will all be used for the book—in the interest of poetry.
   </p>
   
   <p>My brother George will deliver this. He is of the right stamp.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Henry Clapp, Jr. (1814–1875)
      was a journalist, editor and reformer. Whitman and Clapp most likely met in
      Charles Pfaff's beer cellar, located in lower Manhattan. Clapp, who founded the
      literary weekly the <em>Saturday Press</em> in 1858, was
      instrumental in promoting Whitman's poetry and celebrity: over twenty items on
      Whitman appeared in the <em>Press</em> before the periodical
      folded (for the first time) in 1860. Of Clapp Whitman told Horace Traubel, "You
      will have to know something about Henry Clapp if you want to know all about me."
      For more about Whitman's thoughts on Clapp, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, (1906–1996), 9 vols.,
