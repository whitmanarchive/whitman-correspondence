   </p>
   
   <p>I have seen the "Confession of Faith" &amp; read it over more than once<sup><a href="#loc.02156_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it bears my great test of going deeper &amp;
      better the second reading than the first, &amp; deeper still the third—To have
      my poetry received by the emotional &amp; the scientific spirit, each emulating the
      other &amp; warmly endorsing—need I say how it comes to me?
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still here in my nook in Mickle Street—a little change in the domestic
      overseeing arrangements—Mrs Davis has now been here four months, (instead of
      the former folk,) &amp; <em>the change is immensely in my
         favor</em>—I doubt if I could be better provided—
   </p>
   
   <p>Summer is upon us—I shall probably remain <em>here</em>—I
      am lamed (I fear permanently) by my fall &amp; turned ankle of two months since, of
      which I told you in my last<sup><a href="#loc.02156_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; it is best for
      me to not get too far off my own chair &amp; bed—Otherwise I am about in usual
      health—full-bodied &amp; redfaced—Love to you &amp; Herb &amp;
      Grace—tell Herb I rec'd the <em>Standard</em>—if not
      already sent, send me a few numbers of the June <em>To-Day</em>—I suppose you get a paper from me occasionally with piece—a
      fine bright summer forenoon as I write—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02156_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs: Anne Gilchrist | 12 Well Road | Hampstead | London | England. It is
      postmarked: Camden | [illegible] | 1885 | N.J.; Philadelphia | Jun
      | 10 | 1885 | Paid; London, N.W. | ZA | Ju 22 | 85.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

      issue of <u>To-Day</u>. Herbert included it in his biography
      of his mother (1887).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02156_n3">4. Whitman did not inform
      Anne Gilchrist of his sprained leg in his letter of , since the accident occurred on April 28. Perhaps one
      of his letters to her is missing.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02156_n4">5. Although this part (at
      the University of Pennsylvania) has been seperated from the main body of the
      letter, which is in the Pierpont Morgan Library (New York), Edwin Haviland
      Miller places the two together. On June 21-22, when Gilchrist received Whitman's
      communication, she referred to his request for copies for his three
      friends.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02156_n5">6. See the letter from
      Whitman to Richard Monckton Milnes of . On , Anne Gilchrist
      informed Whitman that she was "on the lookout for Miss Smith."<a href="#r6">[back]
