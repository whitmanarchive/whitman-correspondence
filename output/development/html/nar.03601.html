      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been badly pulled by the heat—am sick—(home here with my mother)—&amp; would respectfully
      apply for two weeks further leave—if it can be granted.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If so, I will try to make it up.
      
   </p>

      Yours, &amp;c.

      <br></br>Brooklyn, New York.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I am due at office on the 11th, and would ask <em>two weeks</em> extension from that date.<sup><a href="#nar.00007_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
