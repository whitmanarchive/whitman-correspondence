   <p>Yes I will give you the autograph name &amp; perhaps a sentiment<sup><a href="#nyp.00471_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but would like first to see the picture they would
      go under—Most of the pictures that have been put out of me, quite warrant the
      alarming estimation so many folks entertain—(If it is the drawing F Fowler
      took two years ago in Huntington L[ong] I[sland], <em>I 
         dont
         
          like it at all</em>.) I send you some samples—&amp; should be
      entirely satisfied with a good bold simple rendering of either of the three—If
      you do it at all why not try to do it <em>well</em>.
