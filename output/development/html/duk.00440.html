   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00440_n10">1. Richard Maurice Bucke
      assigned the date September 5, 1865. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's
      date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:377). In this letter, written "tuesday
      afternoon,"Louisa Van Velsor Whitman describes the trip that she completed
      "yesterday," from her home in Brooklyn, New York, to Burlington, Vermont, to
      visit her daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde. In his letter of , Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      reported that "Mother left last Monday," so this letter dates to September 5,
      1865.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n1">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908), the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., resided in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles L.
      Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles was infamous among the
      Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. According
      to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's 
      letter, the reason for Louisa's visit to Hannah in September 1865 was that she
      and her husband had quarreled about "some women that Heyde had in his room."
      Louisa had told Jeff that she intended to "bring Han home," a suggestion that
      Jeff ridiculed. Jeff insisted that Louisa's visit to Hannah be delayed until
      George Washington Whitman could accompany her, but Jeff eventually reconciled
      himself to Louisa's visit to Hannah in Burlington (see his  letter to Walt).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. George
      was available to accompany Louisa on her trip because he had just begun his
      post-war housebuilding business. According to Louisa's  letter, after being mustered out of the army George
      considered journey work (day labor) and starting his own business. Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman recommended the latter but may have encouraged his own
      supervisor Moses Lane to offer George a position with the Brooklyn Water Works
      (see Jeff's  letter to Walt).
      George in July began building houses on speculation, with a partner named Smith
      and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a position as
      inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. During the war, he was wounded in the
      First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken prisoner during the
      Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). For more information on George, see

   <p id="duk.00440_n3">5. Manahatta Whitman
      (1860–1886), known as "Hattie," was the daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother and
      sister-in-law. Hattie, who lived most of the first seven years of her life in
      the same home with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was especially close to her
      grandmother. Hattie and her younger sister Jessie Louisa (1863–1957) were
      both favorites of their uncle Walt.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n7">6. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. Eddy remained in Brooklyn during Louisa's visit to
      Burlington under the care of Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Jeff's wife, with
      whom Louisa and Eddy lived in the Portland Avenue home. George and his wife
      Louisa Orr Haslam cared for Eddy after Louisa's death, with financial support
      from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00440_n5">7. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized name. The letter in which Walt Whitman
      requested papers, possibly related to <em>Drum-Taps</em>, is not
      extant. Jeff Whitman reported that he "sent the bundle" in his  letter. For more on Jeff, see
