   <p>Yours of the 18th received,<sup><a href="#loc.07100_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and in response I enclose a
      check for $373. I hope to be able to send more in a few days by calling in the
      amounts already subscribed as speedily as the pressure of my journalistic work will
      permit. Had I more time it might progress somewhat faster, but I regard it a
      privilege to be able to do what I can, and I only wish more energetic hands and a
      more eloquent tongue might be in charge.

      find yourself domiciled amid surroundings after your own heart.<sup><a href="#prc.00121_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I have had a call from a bright young German-Japanese, your friend Hartmann,<sup><a href="#n4980" id="r3">3</a></sup> who is on his way back to Philadelphia from Europe. It is
      satisfying to see your friends numbered among such diverse races.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="prc.00121_n3">2. Boston friends were
      raising money to buy a summer cottage they hoped would improve Whitman's failing
      health. Whitman eventually used the money to build his extravagant mausoleum in
      Harleigh Cemetery—to the shock and dismay of those who had worked hardest
      to solicit money.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n4980">3. C. Sadakichi Hartmann (ca.
      1867–1944) was an art historian and early critic of photography as an art
      form. He visited Whitman in Camden in the 1880s and published his conversations
      with the poet in 1895. Generally unpopular with other supporters of the poet, he
      was known during his years in Greenwich Village as the "King of Bohemia." For
      more information about Hartmann, see John F. Roche, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_113.html">Hartmann, C. Sadakichi (ca. 1867–1944)</a>," <em>Walt
