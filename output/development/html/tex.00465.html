      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I tried to intercept 
      you on your return 
      from Boston in April.
      I was in N.Y. three or 
      four days from April 18, 
      but found you did not 
      stop. I was greatly pleased 
      over the success of the 
      Boston affair, &amp; over 
      your account of it in 
      the Critic. I am 
      
      
      thinking about running 
      down to see you, &amp; would 
      like to know if I will 
      find you at Camden 
      for the next week or two. 
      Ursula came home from 
      the Hospital early in April 
      in a very bad way—worse 
      than when she went there. 
      We went out to Roxbury
      &amp; stayed there 3 or 4 weeks
      We are now back home 
      for part of the summer 
      at least. She is much 
      better now—in fact seems 
      better than she has done 
      
      
      for a year or two. Julian 
      is well &amp; grows finely. It 
      has been my plan to have 
      you up here for the summer 
      if I could pursuade you 
      to come, But things do 
      not work right. I have 
      saved &amp; partly furnished a 
      large room for you in 
      the other house, but the 
      woman in the other part 
      whom I depended on to look 
      after you has been sick 
      for two months &amp; we begin 
      to fear she will not get 
      well. What are your  
      
               
      plans for the summer, &amp; 
      could you come if things 
      take a favorable turn? 
      I receive papers from you 
      frequently. I sent you a 
      copy of "Pepacton" which 
      no doubt you recd 
      R.H. Stoddard in the "Evening 
      Maid" (Myron Benton says 
      it is he) vents his speen 
      upon it—takes nearly a
      column to condemn it &amp; 
      all that kind of literature.
      But little do I care. I have 
      always had my opinion of 
      him.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see

      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
