   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3019">1. Herbert J. Bathgate was a British
      author and friend of the art critic John Ruskin. His essay "Ouida" was
      advertised in the 1881 Trübner &amp; Co. reprint of Whitman's preface to
      his first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman commented
      on Bathgate later in life: "Bathgate writes genuinely, considerately: he has no
      affectations" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.8.html">Monday, January 28, 1889</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">2. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01084_n1">3. The letter is cut off
      here but a transcription of the letter by William Douglas O'Connor shows that
      Bathgate went on to quote a recent communication from Ruskin: "The reason
      neither he (yourself) nor Emerson are read in England is first—that they
      are deadly true—in the sense of rifles—against all our deadliest
      sins. The second that this truth is asserted with an especial colour of American
      egotism which good English scholars cannot, and bad ones will not endure. This
      is the particular poison and tare by which the Devil has rendered their fruit
      ungatherable but by gleaning and loving hands, or the blessed ones of the poor"
      (Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection of English and American Literature, New
      York Public Library). For Ruskin's January 29 letter to Bathgate, see William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (London:
      Alexander Gardner, 1896), 84. See also the letter from Whitman to Riley of . On February 16, Whitman received
      from Ruskin £10 for five sets of books through Bathgate, to whom the books were
      sent on February 19 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
