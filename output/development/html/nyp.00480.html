   <p id="nyp.00480_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service | Treasury | Washington D C. It is
      postmarked: Camden | Mar | 11 | 6 PM | N.J.; Washington, Recd. | Mar | 12 | 7 AM
      | 188(?) | (?).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00480_n2">2. On  O'Connor informed Whitman that he was
      leaving Washington for Providence, R. I., because of the illness of his
      daughter. It is an interesting sidelight on the relations of O'Connor and
      Whitman that after the resumption of their correspondence in 1882 almost a year
      passed before O'Connor referred to his family or Whitman inquired about Mrs.
      O'Connor and Jeannie. Until the quarrel Whitman was on intimate terms with the
      family; in fact, Mrs. O'Connor continued to write to him for four years after
      the estrangement. Despite Jeannie's critical illness the poet referred to her
      only in this letter and in his letter to O'Connor of . O'Connor mentioned her death on May 23 (Oscar Lion
      Collection, New York Public Library). In 1888 Whitman observed: "Jeannie's death
      was the tragedy of their history—and a tragedy in my history, too. Too
      much must not be said of that or the like of that—it gets down in you
      where words do not go." Horace Traubel reported that Whitman's "eyes were full
      of tears" (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York:
      Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:261). Yet Whitman apparently did not write to
      O'Connor about her death or record it in his Commonplace Book (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
