      <br></br>Camden,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Oct. 13<br xmlns="" class="opener">½ past 1, p.m.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00322_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am having quite a good spell to-day, (if it only lasts)—I wish you, 
      in conjunction with Peter Doyle, would go over to my room at Dr. White's, 
      &amp; unlock the big trunk, (the one that is strapped) and take out
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>My gray suit</em>, coat, vest, &amp; I think there are two pairs of pants, both alike.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My <em>black overcoat</em>, quite heavy—it is the one in the trunk—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Black felt hat, (there are two black hats, this is the lightest, 
      most flexible one—not the big fellow.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The pair of <em>old buckskin gloves</em>, with sheepskin cuffs and do them up in a bundle—I think you can get three or four
      large sheets of <em>very strong brown paper</em> for wrapper, 
      <em>tied securely</em> with very strong cord—direct plainly to me, 431 Stevens st. cor. 
      West, here—put duplicate directions on—&amp; send by Adams express—I write to-day 
      to Peter Doyle, same request as this, and asking him to meet you at Milburn's<sup><a href="#nyp.00322_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> bet 3½ and 4, this afternoon—if not to-day, to-morrow, (or next day, or next still)
      
      will do just as well, as I am in no particular hurry. Pete put the things in the trunk
      for me, 
      &amp; will know about them. Then lock &amp; strap the trunk again, &amp; return key to me. 
      There are two locks, both of which this key unlocks.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your good letter yesterday. I will write promptly if there is any marked change 
      in my condition. I rec'd a letter from Walter Godey, Saturday, &amp; wrote to him yesterday.
      
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>After the bundle is dispatched to express office, write me a line—(As I have said,
      I am in no particular hurry—use your convenience)—
