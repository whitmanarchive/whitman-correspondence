   <p>Only a word to catch this evening's mail—the second letter in today's <em>Tribune</em> fully follows up the first—&amp; I should
      say settles the Chadwick points—Dear friend, I only wanted to say again how
      <em>entirely satisfied</em> I am with your championship, matter
      &amp; spirit—

   <p>The "savage" letter of "<em>Sigma</em>" following seems a very
      curious one.<sup><a href="#nyp.00454_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I am more than half inclined to think
      it some crafty friend who takes the mask of foe—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00454_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd June 19/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service Bureau
      | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Jun | 18 | 6 PM | N.J.;
      Washington, D.C. | Jun | 19 | 4 AM | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00454_n2">2. On  O'Connor notified Whitman of the appearance
      of his article in the New York <em>Tribune</em> and of what Reid
      termed "a savage article on the other side." On  O'Connor tentatively proposed that Spofford, the Librarian of
      Congress, was the author of the letter signed "Sigma" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard,
      1906], 1:314), but on  he decided upon
      Richard H. Stoddard (Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914], 3:49).<a href="#r2">[back]
