   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07519_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: (?) | Apr
      1(?) | 4 30 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.07490_n5">2. A New York lawyer, Thomas
      J. McKee, wrote to Whitman on : "I
      received your letter but had been looking into the matter for some days
      previously, Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke and Mr. Johnston having spoken to me about
      your claim against Worthington. The difficulty I find is this that R.
      Worthington failed some time since and is now unable to do business in his own
      name, and the business is now run by a corporation named the Worthington Co. of
      which Worthington's wife or some female relative is the President. The time
      within which to claim a forfeiture of the plates and books (two years) has run
      out and we are therefore limited to our action for an injunction and damages, I
      am therefore quietly trying to get all the facts I can as to what the
      'Worthington Co.' has been doing with reference to your book. The Company is of
      some responsibility and undoubtedly have possession of the plates. As soon as I
      have facts sufficient to base a sure claim I will get the injunction and money.
      See also Whitman to Richard Watson Gilder, , for an account of Whitman's dealings with Worthington.<a href="#r2">[back]

      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r4">[back]
