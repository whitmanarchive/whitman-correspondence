   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07363_n1">1. This postal card is
      addressed: J H Johnston | Jeweler | 150 Bowery Cor: Broome | New York City. It
      is postmarked: Camden | Feb | (?) | (?); (?) | 2-14-87 | 5-(?).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07363_n2">2. This postcard poses
      problems in dating: there is an ink smudge where Whitman apparently changed 12
      to 14; one legible postmark is clearly "2-14-87." In 1887, however, February 14
      fell on Monday, not on Sunday. The Johnstons had visited Whitman on February 6
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), a fact
      (if correct) which makes some of the comments in the note superfluous. Since the
      poet was "half sick (or more than half) most of the month," he could have erred
      in dating the card either as to the day of the week or the date, or have
      forgotten the recent visit (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
