      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n1027" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>  
   
   <p>I learn to day to my great surprise that the Philistines are down on you again about
      the Children of Adam.<sup><a href="#loc.05529_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> What purblind asses! But there's
      no use in irritating oneself with thinking about it—only somehow every new
      instance of human folly and cant strikes one as something unexpected and
      bewildering; as if one hadn't had plenty of occasion to get accustomed to anything
      or everything in that line. I am sure it will do you more good than harm in the end.
      I am, sometime soon, to read something on the Leaves of Grass before a German
      audience, a 'Literary Club,' in Dresden.<sup><a href="#loc.05529_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> This will
      perhaps lead to my
      finding a collaborateur for the translation—said translation owing to press of
      other business has not been very rigorously pursued lately, but after this month I
      shall take off my coat to it again. You
      received some M.S.? A great event has lately happened in our home. I have
      become the father of a vigorous boy—our first-born; now some ten days old.<sup><a href="#loc.05529_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> "Ay, madam—it is common" but nevertheless it seems
      particular to me, naturally; and is altogether an enlivening and wonderful fact to
      us.
   </p>
   
   <p>What fearful doings in Ireland lately!<sup><a href="#loc.05529_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> I have a
      recantation to make to you on that subject. I remember once writing to you that Home
      Rule, or Separation, was in my opinion a chimerical &amp; undesirable scheme for Ireland. Yet then,
      and always, that was the cause that had my affection &amp; interest—only I saw
      such obstacles in the way, &amp; foresaw such dangers to liberty if it were realized,
      that I could not go with it. Now all that has changed itself in my mind. I recognize
      now the deepseated expression of a national will in the movement. I see that the
      English can <u>never</u> govern us, &amp; do worst when they mean
      best. And I see that the conflicts and miseries which I still believe to be
      inevitable on the fulfilment of the idea, will only be the (necessary) preludes
      towards a grander liberty and nationality than is at all within our reach now. I
      always abominated the English, and it is a great relief to me to find that I
      can support, with the feeling that I am doing right, the cause that I always
      sympathized with in my heart.—One thing is certain—these wretched
      outrages will cease instantly when Ireland has a government of her own. And that she
      will surely have, and I believe before long. If we only had arms we'd have a try
      when England gets into difficulties about this Egyptian business. (So unspeakably
      shameful to her, and <u>more</u> so to France).<sup><a href="#loc.05529_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> But I expect it will be "constitutional" measures for
      some time yet. Nothing perhaps does us more harm than your dynamite party in
      America.<sup><a href="#loc.05529_n6" id="r7">7</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I hope you are well &amp; strong now, &amp; that you'll be well defended in your own
      country against this last outrage.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05529_n1">2. The 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> published in Boston was banned by the
      Society for the Supression of Vice. In May, 1882, Osgood ceased publication of
      the edition, and Rees Welsh and Company reprinted it in the same year. In
      addtion to <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, Rees Welsh and Company
      published <em>Specimen Days and Collect</em> (Philadelphia,
      1882–83). It is this latter book to which Rolleston refers here and the
      receipt of which he acknowledges in his letter to Whitman of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05529_n2">3. Rolleston read a lecture
      on Whitman before the Literarischer Verein of Dresden on September 25, 1883. The
      lecture was published in <em>Ueber Wordsworth und Walt
         Whitman</em>; Zwei Vorträge von H. B. Cotterill und T. W. Rolleston
      (Dresden, 1883). Rolleston has given a humorous account of the Dresden society
      in "The Literarischer Verein of Augustusstadt," <em>The Dublin
         University Review</em> 1 (April 1885), 50–52. The article, which is
      signed "T.W.R.," contains some interesting reflections on German poetry and
      criticism. Rolleston also comments on the lectures on Wordsworth and Whitman
      which he and Cotterill had given before the society and claims that "Walt
      Whitman got, on the whole, a rather more encouraging reception, perhaps because
      he was treated from a more exlusively philosophical point of view." After the
      joint publication in pamphlet form of <em>Ueber Wordsworth und
         Walt Whitman</em>, a good part of it was translated into English by Horace
      Traubel and appeared in the Camden <em>Post</em>, Feburary 13,
      1884.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05529_n3">4. Hugh Charles Rolleston
      died in 1921 after serving with the Australian Expeditionary Force during the
      first World War.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05529_n4">5. The agitation for Home
      Rule and disturbances over agrarian outrages resulted on May 6, 1882, in the
      Phoenix Park murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary of Ireland,
      and Thomas Burke, the permanent Under-Secretary.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05529_n5">6. When Egypt's hazardous
      financial situation required European intervention, England and France
      established dual control in 1876. An antiforeign uprising was crushed in May
      1882 by the British Forces.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05529_n6">7. Philip H. Bagenal in his
      book <em>The American Irish</em> (London, 1882), 220–221,
      discusses the schism among the various Irish leaders in America after the Irish
      agitation of 1879-1881. The schism produced three parties—one headed by
      the editor of the <em>Irish World</em>; another headed by the
      President of the Land League organization in America and the editor of the <em>Pilot</em>; and a third represented by the proprietor of the
      <em>Irish Nation</em> "Besides these, there is yet another
      party, which may be called the Dynamite faction, but even to name the leaders is
      to confer a distinction which they do not deserve. They have not politics at
      heart. They can find no one to trust them. Even the most serious revolutionists
      avoid them, and so they content themselves by making war upon society in
      general, and inciting dupes to commit crimes which they would never have thought
      of themselves!"<a href="#r7">[back]
