      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your letter of Sunday week, Jan. 26—Mother, I hope that lameness in
      the wrist is better by this time.<sup><a href="#nyp.00255_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> There is no news to write you this
      time—I have heard that old Mrs. Mix got through safe to Brooklyn the next
      day—<sup><a href="#nyp.00255_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I
      looked for Jeff, but he didn't come—<sup><a href="#nyp.00255_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> When you write, tell
      me how Jeff is—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you have had a great change in the weather in Brooklyn—we have
      here—for several days past, it has been thawing &amp; melting—Here in
      the office, it is the same old story—it is now about 12 o'clock—the
      Attorney Gen'l. &amp; Ashton<sup><a href="#nyp.00255_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> have gone to the Supreme Court—they go most
      every day now from 11 till 2—&amp; I have little or nothing to do a good deal
      of the time when they are away—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, write whether Jeff got the books, for himself &amp; Dr. Ruggles—<sup><a href="#nyp.00255_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>write how Hattie is—Well, the
      sun is shining, &amp; as I look out this morning on the Potomac, I see the ice is
      broke up, &amp; the river is all open—I hope we shall have but little more
      cold weather—I have not had a very agreeable winter—I have not had a
      satisfactory room &amp; arrangements—I think I shall look around &amp; get
      one more suitable—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, do you still have the office partly in your house—there in the long
      room?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sometimes I feel as though I want to come home for about a week—I think it
      quite likely I shall come before long—I should not be able to stay longer than
      a week—I will tell you though, in time—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mother dear, I believe that is all this time. Give my love to George, &amp;
      Jeff &amp; Mat.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00255_n1">1. In her letter of , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      described the lameness and told Walt Whitman that Jeff planned to visit him in
      Washington the following week.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00255_n2">2. Mary Mix lived with her
      daughter, Juliet Grayson, who operated the boardinghouse at 468 M North, where
      Walt Whitman lived between late January 1865 and February 1866. After her
      daughter's death on January 7, 1867 (which Walt Whitman reported to his mother
      on ), Mix left Washington to live
      with her granddaughter, which Walt Whitman mentioned in his  letter to his mother.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00255_n3">3. Walt Whitman wrote of
      Jeff's visit in his  letter to
      his mother.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00255_n4">4. J. Hubley Ashton was the
      assistant Attorney General from 1864 to 1869.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00255_n5">5. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems."
      Walt Whitman enclosed a copy of Ruggles' obituary with his  letter to his mother.<a href="#r5">[back]
