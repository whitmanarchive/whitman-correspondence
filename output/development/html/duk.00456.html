      Clearest sky I ever saw—norwest quite purple—snow white on roofs and posts—Lake steaming,
      seething, cold-compressed—
      freezing—unusual, not Known in years past—never—at so early a day—Christmass.

   <p>
      God bless you Walt, You are badly stricken—never to recover—to be as you once were—erect,
      vigorous—none of us can be, and yet
      you are blessed with and by a large heart, full of humanity—sympathies for all and
      everyone—for Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      particularly—She is much stricken, Walt—gray—thin, her
      hair blanched—whitened—her hands shrunken—the bones protruding as it were—yet she
      has staunchly kneaded bread and
      made a sweet loaf for herself, she has been crawing after, several days—The public
      have treated us well. 1 ton of coal now in use, sent by
      Isham J. Bliss, Episcopal clergyman, an old friend—50 lbs choice flour—3 fowls and
      a turkey, by other friends unknown—bread,
      sugars—teas, coffee—Lou<sup><a href="#n0368" id="r2">2</a></sup> sent 1 Ham—delcious—cake—jellies—coffee
       tea—delicious—and clothing for Han—also 2 dollars—nothing
      for me—I am unworthy, although I entreated but for 5 dollars, to help pay my interest
      of 15 at the Bank. Your donation of 5 came very
      timely—I had sold a small painting for 10—I send you the bank rect—very stupid and
      very mean I consider George and Lou<sup><a href="#n1046" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      to be—We might have been attacked—and compelled to raise the amt—so small—after so
      many years.

      One more claim for slagging side walk, $86. I have paid up nearly all. I think that
      I can settle balance for 10$—Have some
      expectations of selling a painting cheap—I am bad off for clothes—I bot
       a pair of stockings for self for 30 cents, all I have had this winter—
      any shoes are worn out—bot last winter̬hurting feet now̬God! What a country! People!
      world̬I rekindle at 5 O'clock and have a warm house̬first in the kitchen̬Han is not
