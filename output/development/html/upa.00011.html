      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,<sup xmlns=""><a href="#upa.00011_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been waiting quite a long while for time &amp; the right mood to answer your
      letter<sup><a href="#upa.00011_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in a spirit as serious as its own, &amp; in the
      same unmitigated trust &amp; affection. But more daily work than ever has fallen
      upon me to do the current season, &amp; though I am well &amp; contented, my best
      moods seem to shun me. I wished to give to it a day, a sort of Sabbath or holy day
      apart to itself, under serene &amp; propitious influences—confident that I
      could then write you a letter which would do you good, &amp; me too. But I must at
      least show, without further delay, that I am not insensible to your love. I too send
      you my love. And do you feel no disappointment because I now write but briefly. My
      book is my best letter, my response, my truest explanation of all. In it I have put
      my body &amp; spirit. You understand this better &amp; fuller &amp; clearer than any
      one else. And I too fully &amp; clearly understand the loving &amp; womanly letter
      it has evoked. Enough that there surely exists between us so beautiful &amp;
      delicate a relation, accepted by both of us with joy.<sup><a href="#upa.00011_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00011_n1">1. For forgeries of this
      letter, see <em>Walt Whitman Newsletter</em>, 4 (1958),
      92–93. This letter is Whitman's response to Anne Gilchrist's  letter to Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00011_n2">2. Walt Whitman had not as
      yet received Gilchrist's second letter, written on : "… but spare me the needless suffering of
      uncertainty on this point &amp; let me have one line, one word, of assurance
      that I am no longer hidden from you by a thick cloud—I from thee—not
      thou from me: for I that have never set eyes upon thee…love thee day &amp;
      night.…I am yet young enough to bear thee children, my darling, if God
      should so bless me. And would yield my life for this cause with serene joy if it
      were so appointed, if that were the price for thy having a 'perfect
      child'."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00011_n3">3. After Horace Traubel read
      this letter aloud in 1889, Walt Whitman spoke at some length of the "passionate
      love" of his friends which "offset the venomous hate" of his critics: "The
      substance of that letter—its feel: what it starts out to say to her: oh!
      with a few words taken out and put in—it would do for any of you!" (Horace
      Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.72.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      3:514).<a href="#r3">[back]
