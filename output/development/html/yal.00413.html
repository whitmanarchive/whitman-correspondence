      <br></br><br></br>Dear mother<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0705" id="r1">1</a></sup>,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have come over this afternoon to the office, &amp; am now writing this at my desk. I
      did
      not succeed in working any—was not well enough the past week—although I have not
      gone behindhand—but as I sit here this afternoon, it appears to me I shall be able
      to
      make a commencement next Monday—for, though feeble, I feel just now more like work
      than any time yet—We have had real blowy March weather here to–day, sudden &amp;
      fitful showers &amp; heavy clouds &amp; wind—&amp; now it is quite clear and
      pleasant—I cannot walk around yet but feel in good spirits—am pleased to feel as
      well as I do, &amp; get along as well as I do—Mother, I do not show my sickness in my
      looks, in flesh or face, except very little perhaps—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will finish to–morrow or next day—</p>
   
   
   <p><em>Sunday night—8 o'clock</em>—I still feel as well as
      yesterday, &amp; have been out twice to–day, riding in the cars, &amp; walking a
      little—I get in the cars right at my door, &amp; am brought back there again—It
      has been a beautiful day—I am now sitting in my room, by the stove, but there is
      hardly need of a fire—Peter Doyle is here for a couple of hours—he is
      reading—the doctor has been in to–day—he says I am getting along very
      well—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Monday afternoon 1 o'clock </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I am over at my desk in the office again, writing this. I have rec'd your
      letter
      that the money come safe. I have just written a letter to Jeff,<sup><a href="#yal.00413_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      &amp; enclosed Josephine's<sup><a href="#yal.00413_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; yours in it—I am feeling
      on the gain—but still very slowly. I am taking some medicine, to restore
      strength—yesterday was perhaps my best day—though I feel middling to-day—I
      have not sent the Graphics containing my pieces<sup><a href="#yal.00413_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> as I have not
      had but one copy, &amp; sometimes not that—I send papers to–day—Mother,
      you write me what envelopes you want directed to any of them, &amp; I will send
      them—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is gusty here but quite pleasant—I am feeling quite comfortable, &amp; shall soon
      be walking around I feel confident—I want to come on to Camden, but wish to get a
      little more able to move around first—Love to you &amp; all, Mother dear,
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00413_n1">2. Since Jeff wrote to Walt Whitman on , their letters obviously crossed.
      Walt Whitman's letter is not known.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00413_n2">3. Josephine Barkeloo, a young Brooklyn
      friend of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, was the daughter of Tunis S. Barkeloo, a
      clerk. Josephine Barkeloo wrote three affectionate letters to Louisa before she
      left for Europe in 1872 (Library of Congress). The letter which Walt read was
      sent from Belgium, according to Louisa's letter to Helen Price of March 31, 1873
      (Pierpont Morgan Library).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00413_n3">4. The New York <em>Daily
         Graphic</em> published a number of Walt Whitman's poems and prose pieces in
      1873 and 1874. In the former year the <em>Daily Graphic</em>
      printed the following works: "Nay, Tell Me Not To-day the Publish'd Shame" on
      ; "With All the Gifts, America"
      on ; "The Singing Thrush" (later
      titled "Wandering at Morn") on ;
      "Spain" on ; "Sea Captains, Young or
      Old" (later called "Song for All Seas, All Ships") on ; "Warble for Lilac-Time" on May 12, 1873; "Halls of
      Gold and Lilac" on November 24, 1873; and "Silver and Salmon-Tint" on November
      29, 1873. In 1874, the <em>Daily Graphic</em> printed "A Kiss to
      the Bride" on ; "Song of the
      Universal" on ; and "An Old Man's
      Thought of School" on .<a href="#r4">[back]
