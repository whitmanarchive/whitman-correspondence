   </p>
   
   <p>I send the within letter just rec'd from Harry—I am
      about as usual, &amp; nothing new in my affairs. Susan this will be a mean short
      letter this time—better luck next time—It is heavy and bad outside, the
      wind blowing a gale—(I should like to put on my overshoes &amp; old overcoat
      &amp; <u>go off in the woods</u> for an hour or two)—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I havn't heard from Deb<sup><a href="#loc.05713_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—I hope she is all
      right—Well, bad as the weather is, I must up &amp; go out &amp; across the
      river, or I shall have the horrors. The Lord A'mighty bress<sup><a href="#loc.05713_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> you all—good bye.

      <br></br><br></br>Dr Old Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Am quite well with the exception of the abcess on my neck, it has come again. Dr.
      B—<sup><a href="#loc.03917_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> lanced it few days ago but it dont appear to get much better.
      Recieved the papers and am glad to get them for it is the only way I can get posted.
      Most of my friends appear to have forgotten me or think me of too little importance
      to drop a line.
      Will leave here the first of next month and start for Detroit where I will put
      in a month or so if I can find bread and butter. Please send me a letter of
      introduction to someone there if you know any body it will make it much better for
      me
      and I will not feel entirely alone. I think perhaps Dr. B can give me a letter to
      some of his friends there as he is going to give a lecture there Wednesday evening.
      Don't get the blues worth a dam and dont expect to. Will close for the present.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Stafford was the father of
      Harry Stafford, a young man whom Whitman befriended in 1876 in Camden. Harry's
      parents, George and Susan Stafford, were tenant farmers at White Horse Farm near
      Kirkwood, New Jersey, where Whitman visited them on several occasions. For more
      on Whitman and the Staffords, see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>" <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, eds., (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998), 685.

   <p id="loc.05713_n3">2. Whitman employs a bit of
      the dialect Melville uses in <em>The Confidence Man</em>, where
      the confidence man in the guise of "a grotesque negro cripple" says "God bress
      'em."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03917_n1">3. Harry was at the time
      staying with Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician and
      psychiatrist. Bucke grew close to Whitman after reading (and later memorizing)
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 and meeting the poet in
      Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke claimed in 1872 that a
      reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him to experience "cosmic
      consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany. Bucke became the poet's
      first biographer with <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and he later served as one of his medical advisors and literary
      executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson,
