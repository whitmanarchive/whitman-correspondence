   <p>As I shall not get down to Glendale to-morrow I will write a few lines &amp; send Edward
      Carpenter's letter, rec'd this morning,<sup><a href="#loc.03921_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> which may interest you—As I look out, the ground is all cover'd with snow, a foot
      deep, &amp; the wind blowing quite a gale—&amp; freezing cold—But I have a good fire—Mrs.
      Davis has gone out to market, &amp; shopping—So I am alone in the house—One of my Quaker
      girls Alys Smith<sup><a href="#loc.03921_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> from Germantown has been over to see me to-day—I told her I considered it indeed
      a compliment to pay a visit to a fellow such weather—she said she liked the snow &amp;
      breeze—liked to whack around in it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Sunday Jan 10</em>—<em>noon</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p> Cold, cold, &amp; snow everywhere outside—bad luck all around—the fire goes out, the
      clock stops, &amp; the water-pipe bursts in the bath room—but the sun shines, the bird
      sings away, &amp; Mrs. Davis is in jovial humor—Susan, I wish I had something interesting
      to write you—but I havn't—the Lord be with you all<sup><a href="#loc.03921_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
