   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795â€“1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795â€“1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00433_n1">1. 
      This letter dates to December 25, 1863. Richard Maurice Bucke, on an
      accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent Collection (not reproduced
      here), dated the letter Christmas 1863. No other known letter from Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman dates to December 25, so this letter must be the one that
      Edwin Haviland Miller dated December 25, 1865 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961â€“77], 1:377). Miller's year, 1865, is incorrect, and
      Bucke's year, 1863, is correct.<br><br>
      In this letter, Louisa refers to a December 21â€“23, 1863 letter from
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman to Walt Whitman, mentions Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman's recent return to Brooklyn and his forthcoming surveying
      trip to Albany, and addresses Jeff's  letter to Walt on Jesse Whitman's vicious outburst after
      Andrew Jackson Whitman's death. The letter also provides detail about
      Andrew's funeral, in response to Walt's request.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836â€“1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1â€“26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n8">3. Mattie Whitman's letter was
      enclosed in the same envelope with Louisa's letter. This brief comment may
      reveal significant tension in the household because Mattie's letter followed
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman's report on Jesse Whitman's threatening outburst toward
      Mattie and daughter Manahatta after Andrew Jackson Whitman's December 3 death
      (see Jeff's  letter to Walt
      Whitman and Mattie's December 21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt (Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 32â€“36).
      Louisa knew that Walt had received Jeff's letter, but her awkwardly standoffish
      phrasing about Mattie's letter suggests that the contents of Mattie's December
      21â€“23 letter were kept from Louisa even though both letters were enclosed
      in the same envelope. For her original account of Jesse's outburst, see Louisa's
       letter to
      Walt.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833â€“1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833â€“1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n4">5. Jeff Whitman was in
      Springfield, Massachusetts, performing surveys for William Ezra Worthen (see
      Jeff's  letter to Walt Whitman).
      On his next trip to Copake, New York, Jeff would "make some surveys for an Iron
      Company," which he expected would take him a week to ten days (see his  letter to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n26">6. The word "conceited" is in
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, but she may have intended "congested."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n5">7. Manahatta "Hattie" Whitman
      (1860â€“1886) was the elder daughter of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Though Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was
      frustrated with child care and perhaps eager to defend Jesse Whitman's behavior
      by placing some of the blame for his outburst on her granddaughter Hattie's
      behavior, she would in time become especially close to Hattie, who lived most of
      the first seven years of her life in the same home with Louisa.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n6">8. Jesse Whitman
      (1818â€“1870) was the first-born son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr. He suffered from mental illness that included threats of violence
      for several years. For a short biography of Jesse, see Robert Roper, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.01011.pdf">"Jesse Whitman, Seafarer,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 26:1 (Summer 2008),
      35â€“41.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n27">9. After the family of John
      Brown moved into the Portland Avenue house, Jeff Whitman and family occupied one
      upper floor, the Browns occupied another, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman with
      sons Edward and (within a month or two) Jesse occupied the basement (see
      Louisa's  and  letters to Walt). Following Jesse's
      vicious threats toward Mattie and Hattie, Jeff and Mattie decided to keep Jesse
      out of the living quarters, away from Mattie and the children. See Jeff's  letter to Walt Whitman, and see
      Mattie's December 21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 33â€“34).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n7">10. Jessie Louisa Whitman
      (1863â€“1957), called "the baby" here and "California" later in the letter,
      was born the previous June. She was the younger daughter of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n9">11. Nancy McClure Whitman was
      the widowed wife of Walt's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827â€“1863).
      James "Jimmy" and George "Georgy" were Nancy and Andrew's sons, and Nancy was
      pregnant with Andrew, Jr., when her husband died in December 1863. It is
      believed that prostitution was her means of support, largely on the basis of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's statement in this letter that she "goes it [y?]et in
      the street." For the scholarly consensus on Nancy, see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt
         Whitman</em>, revised edition (New York: New York University Press, 1967), 294,
      398.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00439_n12">12. James "Jimmy" and George
      "Georgy" Whitman were the sons of Andrew Jackson Whitman (1827â€“1863) and
      Nancy McClure Whitman. Nancy was pregnant with Andrew, Jr., when her husband
      Andrew died in 1863. For Nancy and her children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 13â€“14.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n28">13. According to Mattie,
      Nancy McClure Whitman had "nothing but a crust of bread" at the time of
      Mattie's mid-December visit. Mattie gave Nancy a chicken, a dollar, and a
      "basket of Provisions" (see her December 21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt
      Whitman, Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1977], 35).<br><br>
      Like Whitman scholars who have followed, neither Jeff nor Louisa extended
      sympathy to Andrew's wife Nancy McClure Whitman, whom Louisa described as
      dirty and as being on the street (see her  and her  letters to Walt). Nancy was judged an inadequate housekeeper
      by the standards of Louisa and Mattie, but Louisa's and Jeff's letters
      provide hints that the combination of Andrew's drinking sprees, his
      expensive medical treatments (see Jeff Whitman's  letter to Walt), and Nancy's pregnancy rendered
      her and her children financially vulnerable. The financial strain that both
      Jeff and Louisa assumed for Andrew's illness and their fears for George
      Washington Whitman at war may have inured them both to Nancy's suffering.
      Mattie was a bit more sympathetic to Nancy's trials, but she comforted
      herself with religious consolation: "the Lord always provides for the Widow
      and I feel confident that he will provide for her" (see her December
      21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt, Waldron, 35).

   <p id="duk.00433_n11">14. George Washington Whitman's
      military pay may have been the source to pay for Nancy McClure Whitman's rent.
      After Andrew Jackson Whitman's death, George wrote, "dont be the least backward
      in useing [<em>sic</em>] the money for anything you want, and I
      know, you will do all, that is required for, Andrews family" (see George's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman).<a href="#r14">[back]

      (1827â€“1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son
      and Walt Whitman's brother. In the early 1860s, Andrew worked as a carpenter,
      and he enlisted briefly in the Union Army during the Civil War (see Martin G.
      Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 10 [Winter 1993],
      142â€“8). He developed a drinking problem that contributed to his early
      death, on December 3, 1863.<a href="#r15">[back]

   <p id="duk.00433_n21">16. Milgate, a friend of Andrew
      Jackson Whitman from his work at the U.S. Navy Yard, held a raffle for Andrew's
      tools and gave Andrew's wife Nancy $30 (see Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's
      December 21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman, Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 35).<a href="#r16">[back]

   <p id="duk.00433_n14">17. James H. Cornwell, a friend
      of Andrew Jackson Whitman from his work at the U.S. Navy Yard, intends to buy
      Nancy McClure a sewing machine. Thomas Jefferson Whitman, sent by his wife
      Martha to review the desperate condition in Nancy's house, decided against
      offering additional assistance after seeing that Nancy had received the money
      from the sale of Andrew's tools, the provisions that Mattie had provided, and
      Cornwell's plan to purchase her a sewing machine (see Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman's December 21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt, Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 35).<a href="#r17">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n22">18. See Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman's  letter to Walt. Walt
      sent a letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman about institutionalizing Jesse after
      he received Jeff's letter. The letter from Walt, which Louisa received on or
      about December 23, 1863, is not extant (see Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's
      December 21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt, Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1977], 36).<a href="#r18">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n15">19. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?â€“1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his wife. After
      consulting Ruggles, Jeff wrote to Walt Whitman the doctor's opinion of treatment
      for Jesse Whitman in an asylumâ€”that "there might be such a thing as it
      curing him.â€”helping him anyway" (see Jeff's  letter to Walt).<a href="#r19">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n16">20. Walt Whitman presumably
      agreed with Jeff Whitman's recommendation that Jesse Whitman should be
      institutionalized, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman resisted institutionalizing her
      son. Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman wrote to Walt, "untill mother get[s] worse
      I dont think you could pursuade her to send him" (see Mattie's December
      21â€“23, 1863 letter to Walt, Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1977], 36). Jesse was committed to Kings County Lunatic Asylum
      about a year later, in December 1864.<a href="#r20">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n24">21. This rationalization of
      Jesse Whitman's vicious outburst and threats toward Mattie Whitman and her
      daughter Hattie after Andrew Whitman's death is an abbreviated version. Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman again blames Jesse's behavior on his seeing Andrew's body
      (compare her  letter to
      Walt). For corresponding details, also see Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  letter to Walt. Mattie, in a
      letter enclosed with this one to Walt, notes that Louisa resisted
      institutionalizing Jesse (see Mattie's December 21, 1873 letter to Walt, Randall
      H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 33).<a href="#r21">[back]

   <p id="duk.00433_n23">22. George "Georgy" Whitman,
      the son of Nancy McClure Whitman and Andrew Jackson Whitman.<a href="#r22">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n25">23. The second "l" is on the
      next line. Louisa used four techniques to cram words into smaller spaces: she
      omitted ending letters, turned the end of a word downward to squinch it into the
      available space, continued the remainder of the word interlined above, or
      continued on the subsequent line. It was unusual for her to place a single
      letter on the subsequent line.<a href="#r23">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">24. Edward Whitman
      (1835â€“1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r24">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n19">25. Sarah Matilda Heyde Cobb
      (1823â€“) is the sister to Charles Louis Heyde (1822â€“1892), spouse of
      Hannah (Whitman) Heyde (1823â€“1908) and son-in-law to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. She lived in Brooklyn, New York, and was born in Pennsylvania.<a href="#r25">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00433_n20">26. "California" was a nickname
      for Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863â€“1957), the younger daughter of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman. Though Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman referred most often to her granddaughter as "Sis"â€”a
      nickname that Jessie Louisa inherited when her older sister Manahatta became
      "Hattie"â€”Walt Whitman apparently bestowed the private nickname
      "California" on Jessie Louisa shortly after her birth (see his  letter), and it was Walt's
      preferred nickname for his niece. Another source for the nickname's origin may
      be the adaptation of a slang term for moneyâ€”"california it is full of
      tents"â€”from an exclamation that Louisa made upon seeing soldiers gathered
      on Fort Greene in Brooklyn (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r26">[back]
