   <p>With this note I send you a [

       Berkshire almanack which if you look into it at all will
      g[
      <span class="unclear">ive?</span>]
       you some idea
      of the extent and variety of business which the energetic and enterprising lady at
      whose request I write is successfully conducting at Reading<sup><a href="#loc.03711_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Reading. This
      business established by my old and valued friend Mr. George Lovejoy—whose right hand
      Miss Langley<sup><a href="#n4198" id="r3">3</a></sup> became in business matters
      of late years [illegible] was purchased at
      his death by her and has since been even further developed. Few people in Berkshire
      are unacquainted with the name of
      'Lovejoy' as many are reminded by it of obligations incurred and help or advice
      received from him to whom it belonged.
   </p>
   
   <p>But what is all this to you?—Well, merely merely a little
      preamble to prepare your mind for a request Miss Langley desired me, when at
      Reading—(my native town—) for the New Year's day last week, to make to
      you that you might send her <u>a complete list</u> of all books
      &amp;c published by you, that she may obtain the same and add them to her General
      Circulating Library.
   </p>
   
   <p>I d[
      <span class="unclear">on'?</span>]
      t quite know why
      she did not write herself but she is a busy woman and she knows that I am am glad to promote
      your fame and to help, as far as I may, both her and you and, besides, she
      remembers, what I daresay you have long forgotten, that I had the honour of seeing
      you 'at home' in Mickle St in 1886 [
      <span class="unclear">(august)?</span>]
       and was very kindly received by <u>the</u> poet of democracy whose courtesy and truth encourages
      me to hope that this note will find favour or forgiveness with him:—and Miss
      Langley a reply!

   <p id="n4198">3. Eliza Langley (?–1897) was
      the proprietress of a well-known bookselling, library, and stationery
      establishment on London Street in Reading. After serving as a manageress to
      George Lovejoy, the former owner of the business, she purchased it from his
      trustees in 1884 and acted as proprietress until her death in December 1897. She
