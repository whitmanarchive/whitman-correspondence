   <p>Yours of 21<u>st</u><sup><a href="#syr.00043_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> just to hand with
      card from Mrs O'Connor.<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r3">3</a></sup> The latter is gloomy, indeed we must
      not expect much good news from that quarter, I had a note from O'C'<u>s</u> D<u>r</u>, D<u>r</u> Hood,<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r4">4</a></sup> which I enclose, it shows a bad state of things.<sup><a href="#syr.00043_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup> O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> may go on a long time but that
      is hardly to be expected or <u>desired</u>—we much make up
      our minds to his death or <u>worse</u>—for should he live
      much longer his life would necessarily become a burden to himself and others. I do
      not like to write this way but I think you ought to know my candid opinion. The case
      was bad enough before the development of the epeleptoid attacks [/] now it is simply
      desperate. That is as far as we can see—beyond and outside of that is another
      story and I have no doubt (as you have so well taught) that all is well provided for
      and is as it should be. We must have faith and keep cool whatever comes or goes.
   </p>
   
   <p>The weather here today is perfect, like Mary—warm, bright, lovely, and I am
      enjoying it. Yes, I have enough to do it that is a good thing (suppose it is) but
      I
      often wish (we are never content you see) for a little more freedom and
      leisure—but if I had them I guess I should not be a bit more satisfied.
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall be glad (very glad) to get a few copies of that McKay<sup><a href="#n4983" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      picture—I hope thay will make a good job of it. The 1864 picture you gave me
      the other day is setting up on the bookshelf at my right hand looking at me in the
      most friendly way

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4137">3. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae

      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
