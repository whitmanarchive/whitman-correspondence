   <p>Nothing very new or special with me—I am jogging along much the

      have ever had—at present am sitting here by the fire in my little front
      room—have had my late breakfast (I rise late these cold days) of chocolate
      &amp; buckwheat cakes with quince jelly—feel so-so fair—Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#n4152" id="r5">5</a></sup> is here—was 
      here last evn'g—his lecture, debate ab't, &amp; advocacy of, L of G. last Tuesday evn'g
      in N Y. seems to have been quite an
      affair—a success—the leaning of the full dress audience (many ladies)
      was palpably certainly on our side—quite remarkable—Tho' little Fawcett
      &amp; Rev. Lloyd had their say against L of G.<sup><a href="#nyp.00699_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> Rhys delivers lecture again here in

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This letter is addressed to two
      close acquaintances of Whitman: William Sloane Kennedy (1850–1929) and the
      naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921). For more on these figures, see
      these entries from <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed.
      J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998):

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00699_n1">1. In the top margin Whitman
      has written: "send to | John Burroughs | West Park | Ulster County | New
      York."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00699_n2">4. Whitman's letter was
      written on the verso of a ,
      letter from Richard Maurice Bucke, but the part pertaining to O'Connor is
      missing. O'Connor noted Bucke's "very pleasant" visit in a letter to Walt
      Whitman on April 14, 1888 (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.75.html">Friday, April 5, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4152">5. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00699_n3">6. According to the
      Philadelphia <em>Ledger</em> of February 9, Edgar Fawcett
      (1847-1904), a minor poet and novelist, "satirized Walt Whitman's poetry. Mr.
      Fawcett said he had heard it stated that there had been auctioneers' catalogues
      duller than Walt Whitman's poetry, but he attributed that to partisan bias. Rev.
      Mr. [William] Lloyd also condemned Whitman's poetry." For Fawcett's vitriolic
      rant, see Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em>
      (West Yarmouth, Mass.: Stonecroft, 1926), 83–84. Also see <em>The New-York Times</em> of February 9, 1888.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">7. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r7">[back]
