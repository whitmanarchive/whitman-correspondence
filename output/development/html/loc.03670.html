      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I desire to bring under your notice the Christian Kingdom Society in the hope that
      you will sympathise with it—It is formed for the purpose of banding together
      people of different creeds, parties and countries, on the broad lines of loyalty to
      the Christian spirit. We do not enter into theological or ecclesiastical
      discussions, and we discourage all foolish disputations. We aim at bringing about
      those feelings of sympathy and goodwill among all people, for which you are also
      striving. It would be such a great  pleasure to many of us to feel
      that although separated in many camps and living in many countries, we all belong
      to
      one great union—Should you feel that you can honestly accept our basis, it
      would be a great joy to some of us who have read your writings to have you also in
      our 
      assocn
      
       The idea of a great brotherhood—a kingdom, not confined by [
      <span class="unclear">rivers,?</span>]
       or mountains, or
      seas, but extending over all the earth, and embracing men of all nationalities,
      languages, &amp; colors, comes like an inspiration to many—I shall be thankful
      for a card from you if you are interested in the 
      Socy

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Rev. Alexander H. Smith was
      the founder of the "Christian Kingdom Society," a society that apparently strove
      to unite members of various Christian denominations and understood itself as
      undogmatic and hence held neither meetings nor services. In the late 1880s, it
      had around 730 members.
