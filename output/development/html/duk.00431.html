   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00431_n13">1. 
      This letter dates to December 4–5, 1863. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      began composing the letter on Friday evening, December 4, but she did not
      complete it until the following morning or afternoon. Richard M. Bucke dated
      this letter to December 5, 1863. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver dated
      the letter to December 4, 1863 (<em>Faint Clews &amp;
         Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1949], 187–190). Edwin Haviland
      Miller agreed (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:189, 374).<br><br>
      Walt Whitman had departed Brooklyn on December 3 (a Thursday) to return to
      Washington. Louisa began composing the first part of this letter (numbered
      "1") on December 4, 1863, and she conveyed to Walt a detailed account of the
      "particulars of Andrews death," from Walt's departure through his brother's
      decease. Andrew Jackson Whitman died on Thursday afternoon, his body was
      brought to the Portland Avenue home on Thursday evening, and part one of
      Louisa's letter—composed Friday evening and covering four
      pages—closes with Andrew's body lying in his coffin on Friday
      afternoon in the Portland Avenue house. Louisa proclaimed herself "composed
      and ca[lm?]." The second part of the letter (numbered "2") was written later
      that Friday evening or Saturday morning, and Louisa asked Walt to write to
      Hannah Whitman Heyde (Walt's sister in Vermont) and informed Walt of Mrs.
      Brown's kindness. Part two of the letter concludes. The fifth page is
      divided into two sections by a line across the page, but the section below
      the line does not follow immediately in reading order.<br><br>
      Louisa resumed writing on Saturday morning or early afternoon after she
      realized that Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman planned to inform Walt about
      an episode from the night before, which she did not intend to include in her
      letter. The night before, Jesse Whitman, Walt's brother, threatened to whip
      Manahatta, Jeff and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's three-year-old
      daughter. Mattie confronted Jesse, and Louisa eventually calmed Jesse down.
      Louisa resumed her letter on page six (numbered part "3") with the intent to
      offer her account for what she feared would be a more inflammatory account
      were Jeff to write. According to Louisa, Jesse had called Mattie "very bad
      names" and looked "very wild for a while." Louisa blamed Jesse's outburst on
      seeing his brother Andrew's corpse. Jeff may have been temporarily assuaged
      by having his mother inform Walt about Jesse's behavior, but both Jeff and
      Mattie later sent Walt alternate accounts of Jesse's behavior. After
      reaching the bottom of page six, Louisa turned the page and continued her
      letter on the bottom quarter of the previous page (page 5), adding a line to
      divide the page into two sections. Unable to complete the letter in the
      available space, she then selected another sheet of paper and brought the
      letter to a close on the seventh page. The part numbers are in Louisa's
      hand, and they clarify the intended reading order of the letter. The
      transcription is presented in order of composition and an implied order of
      reading.<br><br>
      The letter's opening tone seems deliberately measured to manage unspeakable
      sorrow and to elide Jesse's hellish outburst, from which Louisa would prefer
      to spare Walt. Faced with Jeff's anger, she did her best to manage the
      reshaping of the letter even as its physical layout begins to reveal her
      mental and emotional strain.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00423_n3">2. Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) was Walter Whitman, Sr., and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's son,
      and Walt Whitman's brother. Andrew developed a drinking problem that contributed
      to his early death, leaving behind his wife Nancy McClure Whitman, who was
      pregnant with son Andrew, Jr., and their two sons, George "Georgy" and James
      "Jimmy." For more on Andrew, see Martin G. Murray, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00658.pdf">"Bunkum Did Go Sogering,"</a>

      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George

      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]

      boarding in the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue, Brooklyn in April
      1860. The relationship between the Browns and Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's
      family was often strained, but the Browns remained in the Portland Avenue house
      for five years. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman maintained a cordial relationship with
      the Browns after Jeff and his wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman departed for
      St. Louis. Years later Louisa called on Mrs. Brown and remarked to Walt Whitman,
      "if Jeff and matt knew i had been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their
      books" (see her  letter).<a href="#r10">[back]

      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="duk.00423_n8">12. Cornell is James H.
      Cornwell, a friend of Andrew Whitman, who got him a job in North Carolina in
      1863 building fortifications. Cornwell served as a judge in the Brooklyn City
      Hall and is listed as a lawyer in the 1870 census, which also identifies his
      wife as Mary (b. 1822?) (<em>United States Census, 1870</em>,
      Brooklyn, Kings, New York). He is mentioned in Whitman's "Scenes in a Police
      Justices' Court Room" (<em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em>, September 9,
      1857). For more on the relationship between Andrew Jackson Whitman and Cornwell,

   <p id="duk.00431_n11">13. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. She resided in Burlington, Vermont, with her husband
      Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. The relationship
      between Hannah and Charles was difficult and marred with quarrels and disease.
      Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor
      treatment of Hannah. Walt Whitman said in his  letter to George Washington Whitman that he had "written to
      Han" to notify her of Andrew's death.<a href="#r13">[back]

   <p id="duk.00431_n17">14. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      identified the undertaker as "oaks" and reported paying him $52 in her  letter to Walt Whitman.
      Burdett S. Oakes, listed as an undertaker in the <em>Brooklyn
         Directory</em> (1863), was located at 268 Washington Street.<a href="#r14">[back]

   <p id="duk.00431_n14">15. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman waited almost two weeks to write Walt Whitman, but he gave his account
      of Jesse Whitman's violent outburst in his  letter to Walt. Jeff's letter has essentially the same order of
      events as Louisa's letter but provides harrowing detail. Manahatta, who was a
      bit over three years old, set off her uncle Jesse by "shoving a chair slowly
      toward the stove." Jesse threatened to "break her damn'd neck," and Jeff's wife
      Mattie confronted Jesse and told him "not to dare to lay his hand on her." Jesse
      then turned on Mattie: he threatened to "kill her," to "beat her brains out,"
      and called her a "damed old bitch." See also Mattie's December 21, 1863 letter
      to Walt for another account (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie:
         The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1971], 32–36).<a href="#r15">[back]

   <p id="duk.00431_n16">16. According to Jeff's  letter to Walt, Mattie's back
      pain was so debilitating that she took an hour to make it from the basement up
      two floors to her room. Robert Roper has speculated that Mattie's debilitating
      back pain could have been associated with a congenital weakness or a damaged
      disk (<em>Now the Drum of War</em> [New York: Walker, 2008],
      78).<a href="#r16">[back]

   <p id="duk.00431_n22">17. "Who is there in Brooklyn
      who doesn't know Walt. Whitman? Rough and ready, kind and considerate, generous
      and good, he was ever a friend in need, which is, after all, the only friend
      indeed. Walt is now in Washington, a volunteer nurse, going from hospital to
      hospital, and doing good every minute of his life. We hear of him at the bedside
      of the sick, the pallet of the wounded, the cot of the dying, and the
      pestilential ward. He writes letters home for disabled men, bathes the feverish
      brow of half-crazed soldiers, refreshes the parched lips of neglected sufferers,
      and attends with fidelity and tact to the thousand and one necessities of those
      who approach the gate of death. Surely such as he will find their reward here
      and hereafter" ("Personal," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      December 3, 1863, 3). Because Louisa Van Velsor Whitman just above refers to
      Jesse Whitman's having seen Andrew's body "last night," which was Friday, Louisa
      wrote this portion of her letter on Saturday, December 5. Therefore, "last
      night" in reference to the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> sketch of
      Walt Whitman is an error: the article appeared on December 3.<a href="#r17">[back]
