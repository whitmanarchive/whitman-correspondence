   <p id="nar.00001_n2">2. Charles W. LeGendre
      (1830–1899), born in France and educated at the University of Paris, was a
      soldier who helped to recruit the Fifty-first New York Volunteer Infantry.
      LeGendre was severely wounded at New Bern, North Carolina, on March 14, 1862, as
      George observed in his letter of March 16–18,1862, to his mother, Lousia
      Van Velsor Whitman (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). LeGendre was appointed lieutenant
      colonel on September 20, 1862, and later succeeded Edward Ferrero (see Walt
      Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ) and Robert B. Potter (see Walt Whitman's letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ) as
      commanding officer of the Fifty-first Regiment. During the second Battle of the
      Wilderness, May 6, 1864, he lost his left eye and the bridge of his nose, and
      was honorably discharged on October 4 of the same year. See Whitman's account of
      LeGendre's hospitalization in his letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, 
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
