   <p>Now abt 2 P M—have been out to Mrs: Harned's (Tom's<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      mother's) funeral at noon &amp; for quite a spin in wheel chair since—the sun
      came out finely, after a cloudy mn'g, &amp; the past two days' rain—a little
      cool—The grip (I suppose it is) bad enough on me, &amp; this persistent belly
      ache varied with dots (shoots) of spasms of pain (quite instantaneous) in
      abdomen—have the pain early morning, bed rising—my eating sufficiently
      careful I guess—drink tea the last week (no coffee)—Dr Thomas<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r3">3</a></sup> came over &amp; Fox<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r4">4</a></sup> subsequently with nice
      glasses wh' upon trial did <em>not</em> seem to agree with my
      eyes—strained them, &amp; less clear than my old ones, wh' I resumed &amp;
      since prefer to use—but something may come of it yet—Am specially unwell
      to-day, head ache, but shall probably soon be as usual—I sit here as
      usual—prospect of fine weather the rest of the day—The hatter (Phil<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r5">5</a></sup>) said the hat c'd not be well done over, &amp; sent it back to
      me—have sold one or two big books lately<sup><a href="#loc.07854_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
