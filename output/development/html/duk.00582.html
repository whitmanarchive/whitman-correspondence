   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00582_n11">1. This letter dates to June
      30, 1869. It is dated "June 30" in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, and Richard
      Maurice Bucke dated the letter to the year 1869. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed
      with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:367). Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman writes that she received a letter from Walt "to day wensday," and June
      30 fell on a Wednesday in 1869. The year is also consistent both with her recent
      move to the house that her son George Washington Whitman had provided at 71
      Portland Avenue opposite the Arsenal and with an expected visit by
      daughter-in-law Martha Mitchell Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]

      1869 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman is not extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 2:361).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="duk.00556_n3">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="duk.00573_n7">6. Martha Mitchell "Mattie"
      Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa.
      In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved
      there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie
      suffered a throat ailment that would lead to her death in February 1873. For
      more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University

      edition from 1867 to 1870. The twice-a-day format continued for the three-year
      period. The <em>Brooklyn Union</em> both succeeded and was
      succeeded by a <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> that was issued only
      once per day.<a href="#r8">[back]
