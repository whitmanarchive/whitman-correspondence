   <p id="sta.00006_n1">1. Whitman referred to
      Carpenter's letter of , in which he
      enclosed a letter from a friend named Sharp(?), who termed <em>Leaves of Grass</em> "a barbaric work" and Whitman "the poet of anarchy,
      confusion, lawlessness, disorder, 'anomia,' chaos," who was not even
      "cosmopolitan" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:252–253). Whitman was
      amused and impressed: "I kind o' take to the man: he tumbles me clear over as a
      matter of conscience—I respect him for it" (Traubel, 1:253).<a href="#r1">[back]
