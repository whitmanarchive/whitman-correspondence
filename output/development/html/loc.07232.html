   </p>
   
   <p>I have yours of 2d I do not consider that you owe me anything (the balance is the
      other way). As for Nettie<sup><a href="#n4172" id="r2">2</a></sup> I should like to have here and keep her for your sake as
      long as she lives but it is terribly bad business to send horses here. A horse worth
      $200. in Camden would only be worth $125 to $150. here, and there would be freight
      and
      a <u>heavy duty</u> to pay. I think you ought to have Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> or Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r4">4</a></sup> see to selling the horse
      &amp; wagon  there and
      use the money to hire an easy carriage whenever you are able to get out for a drive.
      The phaeton is not suitable for you now—not easy or solid enough. If you feel
      that you want to <u>give</u> me any thing (you <u>owe</u> me nothing), let it be in the form of
      books—autographed—"Centenial Ed."<sup><a href="#n4175" id="r5">5</a></sup> or "Complete Works"<sup><a href="#n4151" id="r6">6</a></sup> as you like, these
      I should look upon as being equal to greenbacks for solid value. The weather here
      keeps
      perfect—I am rejoiced that you are feeling some easier—you have a
      wonderful constitution and you may (I think <u>will</u>) make a
      good rally when the pleasant cool autumn days come.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07232_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: LOND[illegible] | AM | SP [illegible] | 8[illegible] | CA[illegible];

         </a></p>
   <p id="n4172">2. In September 1885, Whitman received
      a horse ("Nettie") and a phæton as a gift from a group of prominent
      friends, and he used the horse and carriage for three years. A photo is
      available <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image092.html">here</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03745_n1">3. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">4. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4175">5. Whitman published a special issue
      of his 1871 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1876 as a commemorative
      edition for the nation's centennial celebration. <em>Two
         Rivulets</em> was published at the same time to form a matching set.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">6. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
