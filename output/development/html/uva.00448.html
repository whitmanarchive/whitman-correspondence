   <p>Thanks for the copy German rendering "<em>Cradle Endlessly
         Rocking</em>" &amp; for all the other German renderings of my pieces which you have
      sent me, &amp; which I carefully keep, &amp; prize—Dr R M Bucke has just
      published a book about me &amp; my poems—&amp; having two or three advance
      copies (in paper) at my disposal I should like to send you one. Shall I send it as
      before (by mail) to cor: Morris av: and 155th Street? (See the N. Y. <em>Critic</em> June 16)—
   </p>
