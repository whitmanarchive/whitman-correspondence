      <br></br><br></br>Dear William O'Connor,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I arrived home yesterday I found my brother worse than I had anticipated.<sup><a href="#nyp.00263_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> It is a case of malignant erysipelas, with great swelling,
      sores, &amp; for a while complete blindness, now partially relieved. There are
      spells also of lethargy &amp; flightiness—all bad enough, yet, as far as the
      case stands at this present writing, <em>he will come out safe</em>, I
      somehow feel <em>certain</em>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother is well as usual—defers every thing else, &amp; does the nursing,
      &amp;c. for George. When I came, yesterday, I found her standing with a cup of warm
      tea, feeding slowly with a spoon, to some one wrapt in a great blanket, &amp; seated
      in an arm chair, by the stove—I did not recognize my brother at
      first—he was so disfigured, &amp; the features out of all proportion &amp;
      discolored. Mother put down the cup, &amp;c. &amp; began to cry—this affected
      poor George—yet I preserved my composure, though much distrest, as you will
      understand.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The rest of the family are well. Jeff leaves to-morrow evening for St. Louis. It is
      cold here, with raw easterly wind. I met Henry Clapp<sup><a href="#nyp.00263_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> in Broadway yesterday—he has a $1500 clerkship in a public office
      in New York—I met Edward H. House
      <sup><a href="#nyp.00263_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—also other of my young men friends—they are all very, very
      cordial &amp; hospitable—I shall go over &amp; make Mrs. Price a short visit
      this afternoon. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>They all talk of you here—as of the good person, the desired one, exhilarating,
      whose presence gives sun, &amp; whose talk nourishes—(I think you must have
      laid yourself out that evening.)<sup><a href="#nyp.00263_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Nelly, I send you my love—also to Charles Eldridge—shall probably
      remain here the ensuing week. 
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00263_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "Wm. D. O'Connor, | Light House Board, | U.S. Treasury Dep't.
      | Washington, | D.C." It is postmarked: "New-York | May | 8 | (?)."<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00263_n3">2. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman reported
      that George Washington Whitman was not well, but was still able to go to work;
      she did not indicate the gravity of his illness. She was upset by all the
      turmoil involved in Jeff's moving. Martha, somewhat impulsively, sold all the
      furnishings "and spent the money as fast as it came in for clothes to go in the
      country." Under the circumstances, since the family desperately needed some one
      who could "take things coolly," it is understandable that Walt Whitman decided
      to hurry to Brooklyn.<a href="#r2">[back]

      Henry Clapp (1814–1875) was one of Walt Whitman's intimates from the
      Pfaffian days. Restless and adventurous, Clapp roamed to Paris, returned in
      the 1840s to Lynn, Massachusetts, to edit the <em>Essex County
         Washington</em> (later <em>The Pioneer</em>), and
      eventually went to New York, where he became "king of the Bohemians." As
      editor of the short-lived <em>Saturday Press</em>
      (1858–1860; 1865–1866), he printed  ("Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking"),
      and, in 1860, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/leaves1860/anc.00035.html">praised <em>Leaves of Grass</em></a> when others
      condemned it; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary
         Singer</em> (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1955), 242–244,
      260–261. "Henry Clapp," Walt Whitman said to Horace Traubel, "stepped
      out from the crowd of hooters—was my friend: a much needed ally at
      that time (having a paper of his own) when almost the whole press of America
      when it mentioned me at all treated me with derision or worse. If you ever
      write anything about me in which it may be properly alluded to I hope you
      will say good things about Henry Clapp" (Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.63.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996], 1:236).
      In his reply to Walt Whitman on ,
      O'Connor was amused that Clapp was "becoming a respectable citizen. When
      once a man enters upon the downward path, &amp;c.…one can see as the
      guilty result of Bohemianism, a place in the Common Council or Board of
      Aldermen!"<br><br>
      See also Clapp's  and  letters to Whitman. Clapp is
      referred to in Whitman's 
      letter to William D. O'Connor and in his  letter to John Burroughs. See William Winter's
      sympathetic account of Clapp in <em>Old Friends, Being
         Literary Recollections of Other Days</em> (New York: Moffat, Yard and
      Company, 1909), 57–63. <a href="#r3">[back]

      Edward Howard House (1836–1901) was music and drama critic of the <em>Boston Courier</em> from 1854 to 1858, and was appointed
      to the same post on the New York <em>Tribune</em> in 1858.
      Walt Whitman evidently knew House as early as 1857, for, in his "Autograph
      Notebook—1857" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.), he pasted
      a calling card signed by House. During the Civil War, House was a war
      correspondent for the <em>Tribune</em>.<br><br>
      At this time House was not with the New York <em>Tribune</em>;
      he was engaged in theatrical management in New York and London.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00263_n6">5. O'Connor, much flattered
      by this paragraph, compared himself to "a young girl finding herself beloved or
      admired by some one unsuspected before." In the same letter of , he went on to describe how deeply
      Whitman's mother "affected" him: "Her cheerfulness, her infinite gentleness and
      tenderness, were like the deep smile of the evening sky. As I saw her that
      night, with the children on each side, and each leaning a head upon her, I
      thought of the Madonna grown old."<a href="#r5">[back]
