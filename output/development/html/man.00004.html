   </p>
   
   
   <p>Enclosed please find a draft for twenty ($20.) dollars for which please send me 3
      copies of "Leaves of Grass" and 1 copy of "Two Rivulets."<sup><a href="#man.00004_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I delivered my lecture in Chatham the other day and this is some of the result—I
      shall probably have some more orders from them after a little—I am engaged to deliver
      the lecture in London &amp; Sarnia this month and I shall be pretty sure to have orders
      from both these towns I think therefore that 
      
      
      
      it would be as well for you to send me some copies to account for—say 4 copies of
      "L. of G." &amp; 2 of "T. R." or even more if you have plenty of copies on hand—If you
      send the books in a box please take care that there are no nails projecting into it—one
      vol. of the last batch got a little scratched up this way—You had better leave the
      expressage to be paid here as before &amp; I will charge it against future remittances
