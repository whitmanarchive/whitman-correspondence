   <p>We have had cold &amp; spiteful weather all the time of my visit here—over a month—&amp; I
      have not had my usual outdoor enjoyment, loafing about &amp;c—have been indoors most of
      the time—I also caught cold just on coming here, &amp; it has bothered ever since.

   <p>How are you, dear friend? &amp; how is 'Sula<sup><a href="#nyp.00301_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—dear friend, too—Write me a few lines, John—let me know how Chauncey<sup><a href="#nyp.00301_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is getting along—if he finds any difficulty—but I guess not—I guess he is getting
      along well—Is there any thing new among my friends there in Wash'n?

   <p>I have got out my new edition, from same plates as the last, only all bound in One
      Vol.—neatly done in green cloth, vellum—looks the best &amp; most ship-shape of any edition
      yet—have not added any of my later pieces in this—leaving them to some future issue—

   <p>Rec'd a letter from Mrs. Gilchrist in England—she has been reading "Wake Robin" &amp;
      takes to it greatly<sup><a href="#nyp.00301_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—says Rossetti dined at her house not long since—(You know she is the authoress of
      the "Woman's Estimate," in the Radical)—

   <p>John, I think it likely I shall return about the 1st of April—Mother has had a bad
      spell for three days, but is about as usual again, yesterday &amp; to-day—direct to me
      here—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00301_n1">1. 
      This letter, as the contents confirm, was written at the same time as
      Whitman's  letter to Peter
      Doyle. Evidently one of the executors inserted "'71" after the date on the
      manuscript.<br><br>
      This letter's envelope bears the address, "John Burroughs, | Office
      Comptroller | of the Currency, | Washington, | D.C." It is postmarked, "New
      York | Mar | 15 | (?)30 PM."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00301_n2">2. Burroughs' wife
      Ursula.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00301_n3">3. Chauncey B. Deyo,
      Burroughs' nephew, was substituting for Whitman while he was in Brooklyn; see
      Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em>
      (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931), 88. Whitman wrote of Deyo's "sudden
      insanity &amp; death" in his  letter
      to Burroughs and in his  letter to
      Ellen M. O'Connor.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00301_n4">4. Gilchrist referred to
      reading Burroughs' <em>Wake-Robin</em> (1871) in a letter to
      Burroughs on October 19, 1875 (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 115). It
      is surprising that not until this late date did Whitman inform his friend of
      Gilchrist's authorship of the article in <em>The
         Radical</em>.<a href="#r4">[back]
