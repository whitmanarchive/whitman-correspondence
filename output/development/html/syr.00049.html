      Very sorry to hear such bad accounts of the cold but trust it will soon be better,
      [/] wish you could have a good alcohol bath, real good sweat, would help you very
      much—can you not get some one in Camden to help you to arrange an alcohol
      bath—it is extremely simple. Willy Gurd<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r3">3</a></sup> still here, he
      goes East tomorrow morning, has the gas meter<sup><a href="#syr.00049_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> all
      constructed ("in his minds eye") already, will soon put it together when he gets
      alongside his lathe—all well here and nothing new. Ground still quite white
      with snow

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4284">3. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."

   <p id="syr.00049_n3">4. Although Whitman
      celebrated "gasometers" in "Song of the Exposition"—in which the Muse is
      "Bluff'd not a bit by drain-pipe, gasometers, artificial fertilizers" (1. 57;
      <em>Leaves of Grass: Comprehensive Reader's Edition</em>
      [1965], 198)—he had little faith in Gurd's new invention: "It's equally
      useless whether it's the one thing or the other [i.e. the water meter or the gas
      meter]" (see above reference to Traubel).<a href="#r4">[back]
