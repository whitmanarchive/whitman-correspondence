      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is very nice to know that you are well enough to write two such nice letters.<sup><a href="#loc.02574_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>It is wonderful—the rallying power that dame Nature gives us.</p>
   
   
   <p>I am glad you are pleased with my idea of Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      lecturing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It will be a great event. One that us Whitmanites will rejoice over as long as we
      live.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got Ingersoll interested two years ago in Saratoga.</p>
   
   
   <p>Since then he has dipped into L. of G. very often, (I can tell) and now—what do
      you think!! The other
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>day he said to me "Johnston do you know that I think there is nothing greater in
      Poetry in our language than Walt's tribute to Lincoln"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ingersoll has a great soul, and it did me good to hear him say it. And it was then
      I
      suggested the lecture, I want an address by him in permanent shape, that dinner
      speech ought to have been saved for posterity—Now we will perhaps have
      something as great or greater.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Excuse great haste. Regards to Mrs Davis<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r4">4</a></sup>.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n0839">3. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r3">[back]
