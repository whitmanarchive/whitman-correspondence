      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sorry to hear of your being kept in with rheumatism.<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r1">1</a></sup> I am afraid you have been suffering a good deal. And just at this spring time it
      is such a pleasure to be out and about. I hope by the time this reaches you you may
      be well again. You will 
      
      
      
      miss the Gilchrists a good deal. I had a letter from Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r2">2</a></sup> about a fortnight ago telling me of their move. She seems to be wanting to get back
      to England. Herbert<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r3">3</a></sup> I suppose is travelling about a bit. I feel sorry that the household in North 22
      street is broken up—I so often look back to those few days I spent there. I wonder
      whether we shall all meet again in England. Is there still a chance of 
      
      
      
      your coming?
   </p>
   
   
   <p> My winter's work of lecturing is over now; I have had a very pleasant time of it—though
      living a rather solitary life. I was lecturing in 3 towns—York, Sheffield and Chesterfield.
      I made the last my headquarters, and then went once a week to York, twice to Sheffield
      and gave a lecture every week in Chesterfield. The people write answers to the questions
      in the lecture and then send up papers which I look over &amp; return to them. It is interesting
      work because one 
      
      
      
      has all sorts of people—men &amp; women young and old of all conditions of life—except
      the poorest. And one gets to know a good many of them. We had a jolly excursion the
      other day into the country near Sheffield—a sort of geological open air science ramble.
      About 70 people came old &amp; young, respectables &amp; non respectables, and it was very
      friendly &amp; pleasant.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am staying here now with my friend Cotterill<sup><a href="#n0891" id="r4">4</a></sup> who has just returned from African explorations. And in a few days I am going home
      to Brighton. I met a brother of Edward Dowden's<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r5">5</a></sup> here 
      
      
      
      a day or two ago—a parson—a pleasant sort of fellow—Irish. Thank Harry Stafford<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r6">6</a></sup> for me please for his letter. If he gets a photograph of himself done any time, I
      should like one.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0141b">1. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0890">2. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0891">4. Henry B. Cotterill was a
      schoolfellow of Edward Carpenter at Brighton College. After lecturing in
      pedagogy at Harrow School, he went on an exploration in Africa, around Malawi,
      Mozambique, and Tanzania. (Carpenter recalls this in his <em>My
         Days and Dreams, Being Autobiographical Notes</em> [London: G. Allen &amp;
      Unwin, 1916], 232–233). Cotterill was the author of various books about
      Ancient Greece, Medieval Italy, and Italian literature. He also carried out a
      translation of the complete Odyssey of Homer into English hexameters.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0199">5. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">6. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
