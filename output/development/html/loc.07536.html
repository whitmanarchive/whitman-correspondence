      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07536_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,
      N.J. | Dec 27 | 8 PM | 88.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6000">2. Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07536_n2">3. Baxter thanked Whitman on
       for his copy of <em>Complete Poetry &amp; Prose</em> and recommended that Whitman
      read Bellamy's <em>Looking Backward</em>, "a noble work, and
      delightful as well. It has made a profound impression and will do much towards
      realizing a grander future for our land."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07536_n3">4. Whitman had printed a
      broadside entitled "An impromptu criticism on the 900 page Volume, The Complete
      Poems and Prose of Walt Whitman, first issued December, 1888" (reprinted in
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>). The broadside was from a letter Bucke
      had sent to Whitman, though Whitman acknowledged he "never asked Doctor if I
      might print it." Whitman excused his own failure to seek Bucke's permission
      since it was "a private affair, all in the family: only for the elect, the few,"
      though he had "quite a number struck off."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07536_n8">5. Bucke seems to have
      written to Whitman twice on December 24, 1888. Since the only surviving letter
      from Bucke of that date does not mention food or alcohol, the letter that
      Whitman references here is lost.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07536_n4">6. The article in the <em>Post</em> was a factual account of his recent illness written
      by the poet himself (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>). Not surprisingly, he had obtained
      thirty copies of the article to send to friends.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0915">7. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">8. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07536_n5">9. On , Sanborn thanked Whitman, and
      noted that he had two copies of the first edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, given to him by Emerson and Sophia Thoreau (Feinberg; Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.57.html">Thursday, December 27, 1888</a>). Kennedy wrote enthusiastically on the
      same day about the new book, which he personally delivered to Sanborn, Sylvester
      Baxter, Hamlin Garland, and Elisabeth Fairchild (see ; Feinberg).<a href="#r9">[back]
