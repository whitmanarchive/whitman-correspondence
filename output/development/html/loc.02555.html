      <br></br><br></br>Dear Johnston
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How are you—&amp; all?—I want to hear about Al and May—&amp; I want to hear about the baby—Please
      do a little thing for me—there was a white tea-cup &amp; saucer, a "moustache-cup" given
      me by a soldier, &amp; I left it at your house—if it is unbroken &amp; still there, please
      have some of your fellows box it neatly &amp; express it here to me—How are all your 
      
          
      fellows in the store? Tell them I remember them all so well &amp; so pleasantly—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have been down in the country at a secluded primitive farm all summer, living much
      of the time outdoors by a solitary woody pond, (half the time naked or half-naked)—am
      now quite fat &amp; all tanned &amp; red—Love to you, my friend—
   </p>

   <p>Where &amp; how is Waters? Where is the picture?</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02555_n1">1. Since this letter
      apparently refers to Whitman's extended visits to Kirkwood in 1877 and to his
      stay with the Johnstons in March, the year is almost positive. The reference in
      the last line to G.W. Waters, who had recently painted the poet's portrait, also
      points to this year.<a href="#r1">[back]
