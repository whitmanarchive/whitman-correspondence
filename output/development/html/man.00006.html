   <p>The two copies of "Leaves of Grass" came safely to hand:<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have given them to Anderson (as in letter of 18th inst.) and he will begin advertizing "Leaves of Grass" and <u>also</u> "Two Rivulets" tomorrow morning. I want you now to send <u>me</u> two copies of "Two Rivulets" at once so that he will have both vols<sup><a href="#man.00006_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> —Do not mail the books to Anderson as I told you on 18th<sup><a href="#man.00006_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> but mail them to <u>me</u>—Please answer my letter of 18th as soon as you can make it convenient to do so.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course the Canadian purchaser ought to pay the <u>duty</u> but I am afraid it would never do to make the cost of the book more than 
          
      $5.00—this price itself is enough to keep 9 out of every 10 who would like to have
      the book from buying it—I wish you could see your way to get the book into the hands
      of a good publisher and sell it at a moderate rate. I hope yet before I die to see
      the whole book published at about $1. and in the hands of the [illegible] every where.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00006_n1">2. Concerning the shipment
      of books to Bucke in March 1880, Whitman made the following entries in his
      Commonplace Book: 17 March 1880: "sent Dr Bucke Two copies of L of G. on sale,"
      and 26 March 1880: "sent Dr Bucke three Vols: two TR and one of L of G. 5 Vols
      in all to be acc't for $3.50 each" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
