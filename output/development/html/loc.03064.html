      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have your postal card of yesterday. I send you a <u>Tribune</u> of Sunday, as I see by your card that up to 
      afternoon, you had not seen it. On the 5th page is my touch at Comstock. I hope it
      will do you good.
   </p>
   
   <p>The editor printed it just as I wrote it except the  opening sentence, which read: "Mr. Anthony Comstock's hostility to the nude—of which
      an illustrious instance was his 
      famous prosecution of three unfortunate women, whom he had hired to dance before him
      for over an hour, without clothing, in a 
      New York brothel—appears to extend to even the naked truth." The mild
       editor has spared <u>Teufelsdröckh</u> the bloody stripe this sarcasm would have 
      left upon him, by excising the sentence. But he gets enough. The vagabond.
   </p>
   
   <p>Now for Tobey! I wish I were not so driven with work, and felt well. I have been much
      played out this summer, especially
      the last month.
   </p>
   
   <p>Glad to hear your prose book is so well advanced and that the third edition of the "Leaves" is flying out. Rees Welsh &amp; Co
      must take care not to get left, but have the books on hand, for I think by September
      we shall have a boom in full drive. I will do
      my best to keep up the controversy.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tucker has fairly cowed Stevens &amp; Co in Boston. My private advices are very amusing.
      Pity Osgood was such a craven, though better for you.
   </p>
