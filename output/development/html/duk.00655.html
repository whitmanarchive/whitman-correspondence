      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you got my letter last Saturday, 21st—All goes along at present the
      same old story—nothing new in the office—I shall be glad when Grant
      comes in, &amp; a new Attorney Gen'l appointed—if I weather it out till
      then—though I am well enough off, at present, &amp; probably safe—I
      don't think there is any show for Mr. Evarts<sup><a href="#duk.00655_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> remaining here after Grant comes in—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are having a splendid spell of weather again, after the storm of Saturday
      last—To-day it is very fine—I should like to be with you on
      Thanksgiving, Thursday—I shall take dinner at my boarding house—Mrs.
      Benedict<sup><a href="#duk.00655_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> told me yesterday to bring any of my friends to dinner I wanted
      to—I still have the same room—I make a fire mornings, &amp; have it
      quite comfortable—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Is Jeff home?<sup><a href="#duk.00655_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Martha must keep up good
      spirits—I have no doubt she will get all right again<sup><a href="#duk.00655_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I approve
      what you advised her about the wine—it is as George said, you can't get any
      real pure port wine—I shall keep watch of the place in Western Pennsylvania I
      spoke of, &amp; if they have any genuine wine, as I was informed they would in
      January, I shall get some for Martha—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Has George done any thing about the Portland av. house, yet?<sup><a href="#duk.00655_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Write to me all the news. Your letter came last week, &amp;
      was welcome. I am quite busy to-day—have several jobs of work in the office
      that keep me hard at it—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Love to you, dearest mother—&amp; to all—</p>
   
   
   <p>I have had to scratch off my letter in a hurry, but I wanted you to have something,
      according to promise in my last.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00655_n1">1. William Maxwell Evarts
      (1818–1901) was chief counsel for Andrew Johnson during the impeachment
      trial of 1868. As a reward for his services, Johnson appointed Evarts Attorney
      General later in the year; Evarts was Secretary of State from 1877 to 1881 and
      U.S. Senator from New York from 1885 to 1891.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00655_n2">2. Mr. and Mrs. Newton
      Benedict were Walt Whitman's landlords at 468 M North, having replaced Juliet
      Grayson after her death in 1867. Whitman recorded this change in management in
      his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00655_n3">3. On November 18, 1868,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman reported that Jeff was on his way from St. Louis to
      Brooklyn (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book,
      Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00655_n4">4. On November 11 (?), 1868,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote: "matty is improving but far from well. the
      doctor is doctoring her throat with great success. i think he has performed two
      moderate 
      opperations
      
       on her throat, but o dear if you could hear her talk it would make me
      hoarse to talk a steady stream as she does when any one comes on to see her"
      (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library). After Jeff's family left, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman complained, on December 14 (?), 1868, that they had not paid for any "
      provitions
      
      " while they stayed in Brooklyn: "i did really think they had ought to
      give me some [money] but let every thing go but i would ask more than 100$ to go
      through the same again (<em>burn this letter</em>)" (The Trent
      Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special
      Collections Library).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00655_n5">5. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      added a postscript to her letter of December 14 (?): "george has commenced his
      house. they are digging the cellar" (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r5">[back]
