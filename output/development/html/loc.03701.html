      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I was shown the new type so kindly given by you to Miss Grace Hunter<sup><a href="#loc.03701_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> a day or two ago, and I think it, by far, the finest I
      have seen of you in any form. I am so pleased that I write immediately to beg of you
      to reserve one for me, if it so happen you have another to spare. I leave the city
      to day for 2 or 3 months (Marlton N.J. Your friend Mr. Stafford<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r2">2</a></sup> is at the station
      there) as I am in very  delicate health, but will call for it, if you will allow me, on my
      return in the fall, provided of course that you are disposed to favor me so highly.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I have seen Mr. Hunter two or three times daily for months—when both in the
      city—and I spent last evening with him and his daughter. He read "Eidolons"; Mr. H—
      several times. I am
      not prepared to say that I have arrived at its best significance as yet and intend
      giving full study. Other poems were also read and I think Mr. H is fully impressed
      he shall like them more and more as he allows a better and more familiar
      acquaintance. For myself, I have held for years that you are the greatest  "master of
      words" in the language, and although the source is humble you will appreciate from
      the fact that the prophet is so rarely duly appraised in his own country, and that
      in local circles my opinion as a wide reader and a student is not without its own
      little influence. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I have been begging Mr. Hunter to bring me to call with him—fearing otherwise
      I should infringe upon your time—but he is very selfish and comes by himself.
      I am sure he thinks you will get all the compliments and it is best for himself to
      leave me at home. Yet, oh yes, he is very <u>very</u> good and
      has my interests, literary and  otherwise, quite at heart, so it is not so very hard to forgive
      him, only—well, I should have liked very much to have come, and trust you will 
      comission
      
       me the pleasure sometime after the Canadian trip which I understand it is
      now your intention to take. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Wishing you every benefit form the occasion, and a safe and hearty return. I am </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very Truly Yours
      <br></br>Elizabeth J. Sharpe.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p> P.S. I have been collecting every little item pertaining to you for the past 2
      or three years that I find afloat; shall continue for the next ten if I
      live. I am now 28. I trust my ability may equal the time &amp; material before me to compile
      judiciously and in [
      <span class="unclear">worthiness?</span>]
       the
      subject, as it is my desire to do [
      <span class="unclear">sl?</span>]
       [illegible].

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elizabeth J. Sharpe was a friend of
      the Stafford family; the Staffords' farm at Timber Creek in Laurel Springs, New
      Jersey, was a frequent refuge for Whitman in the 1870s and 1880s.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03701_n2">1. Grace was one of the
      daughters of James Hunter (1818–1894), a Scottish friend of
      Whitman's.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">2. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
