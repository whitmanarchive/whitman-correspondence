      <br></br><em xmlns="">Washington</em>,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">July 19, 1867.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Hiram Ramsdell: H.
      J. Ramsdell was a clerk in Washington; in a hospital notebook (Henry E.
      Huntington Library), Walt Whitman called him "chief clerk." In the 1869
      Directory, he was listed as a correspondent. On May 8, 1867,
      
      Ramsdell reported the high praise that George Townsend<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n0643" id="r1">1</a></sup>, the journalist
      (1841–1914), accorded to Walt Whitman—"a stupendous genius,"
      "the song of a God." On July 17, 1867,
       he
      asked Walt Whitman to do whatever he could for Judge Milton Kelly, of Idaho,
      against whom charges had been brought by "a very bad man," Congressman
      Edward D. Holbrook (1836–1870). Actually, on July 12, 1867, Walt
      Whitman had submitted to the Attorney General a "Reporton the
      <em xmlns="">Charges</em> submitted by<em xmlns="">Hon. E. D.
         Holbrook</em>, Del[egate] from Idaho Terr[itory],<em xmlns="">against</em><em xmlns="">Hon. Milton
         Kelly</em>, Asso[ciate] Just[ice] Supreme Court of Idaho" (National
      Archives). To this forty-one page summary of the evidence, all in Walt
      Whitman's hand, there is appended a letter signed by Stanbery but written by
      Walt Whitman, dated July 20, 1867: "The Conclusion in the preceding Report
      is hereby adopted by me, &amp; ordered to stand as the decision of this
      Office in the Case, so far as now presented." On July 22, 1867,
      
      Ramsdell apologized for his "aggressiveness." (Ramsdell's letters are in the
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection.) Judge Kelly wrote to Walt Whitman on
      June(?) 21, 1867 (National Archives), and again on August 9, 1867 (Yale).
      
      On November 15, 1875, Ramsdell, among others, petitioned Benjamin H. Bristow
      (1832–1896), Secretary of the Treasury, that Walt Whitman "be
      appointed to a position in the Treasury Department" (National Archives).

   <p>Mr. Cummins has called upon me, bringing me your note of 17th, &amp; we have had
      quite a talk— he seems to be a wide-awake, candid young man, &amp; makes a
      good impression on me. He spoke of you, of his own affairs &amp; fortunes, of Idaho,
      of Judge Kelly, Holbrook &amp;c. &amp;c—In respect to Judge Kelly, &amp; his
      matter, I had already formed my opinion, &amp; made out my Report several days
      ago—The Attorney General is full of anxiety &amp; debate, on the big things
      that are up, just now—&amp; has not been able to hear the Report, &amp; decide
      upon it—but he told me this morning he would try to do so very shortly. If he
      decides as I have advised him, you &amp; Cummins will have no reason to be
      dissatisfied.

   <p>Dear Friend, I rec'd your note when you left here—it was sent on to me at
      Brooklyn. I value George Alfred Townsend's appreciation of L. of G. It was
      magnificent. Where is Townsend now? I hope it may happen one day that I may have him
      near at hand, that we get to be friends—such is in my mind.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new in my affairs—all goes on as usual in the office. I am
      well. After a hot spell of a week, during the last of June, we have had the finest
      kind of weather here the most of this month—
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Remembrance &amp; love to you, wife, &amp; baby too. Farewell.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0643">1. George Alfred Townsend (1841–1914) was a
      journalist who contributed to the New York <em>Herald</em> and the
      Chicago <em>Tribune</em>. See also Walt Whitman's , letter to William D. O'Connor.
      Probably because of Townsend's affiliation, Whitman sent "Song of the
      Exposition" to the Chicago <em>Tribune</em> on May 5, 1876
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book). On May 10, 1876, the newspaper returned the
      manuscript because it arrived too late for publication (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection).<a href="#r1">[back]
