   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0323">3. William Ingram, a Quaker, kept a tea
      store—William Ingram and Son Tea Dealers–in Philadelphia. Of Ingram,
      Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "He is a man of the Thomas Paine
      stripe—full of benevolent impulses, of radicalism, of the desire to
      alleviate the sufferings of the world—especially the sufferings of
      prisoners in jails, who are his protégés" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.53.html">Sunday, May 20, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]

      and friend of Whitman's New York jeweler friend J. H. Johnston as well as an
      acquaintance of Horace Traubel (see <em>Notebooks and Unpublished

      Loag's name as "Logue"). See also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
