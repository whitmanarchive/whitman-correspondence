      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Sep. 13, '71.
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been voyaging amid the Hebrides,—strolling amid the
      Highlands,—loafing by the sea,—trying to extract from two or three
      weeks' vacation some 
      vigour
      
       and virtue for my work, which in these last years grows heavy. On
      returning I found your munificence to be as of old. The three volumes, and the
      photographs were most welcome. A third photograph was sent to me by Sharman. (If you see him tell him that his accompanying letter got lost
      in my absence or it 
      shd
      
       have been answered.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About the same time that I received your volumes I got a letter from Kate Hillard, (a brilliant girl and writer of Brooklyn who was here last
      year) written 
      
       from the Adirondacks.
      She says:—"I have made a discovery since I have been here, and that is, that I
      never half appreciated Walt Whitman's poetry till now, much as I fancied I enjoyed
      it. To me he is the only poet fit to be read in the mountains, the only one who can
      reach and level their lift, to use his own words, to pass and continue beyond. The
      others seem more or less paltry and insufficient, except Shakespeare, and he seems
      almost too courtly. But Walt Whitman exactly accords with the ruggedness and
      tenderness of the mountains, and seems in some way more their fellow. At any rate
      he
      so affects me, and what other thing can we know?"
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>2d that.</p>
   
   <p>I copy this for you as it is in a way what the mountains said about you to the
      girl.
   </p>
   
   <p> As you may judge, the criticism in the Westminster Review seemed to me valuable on
      account of its stand-point and main principles. The 
      Hon
      
       Roden Noel (one of the Lord Byron blood, and author
      of a pleasing volume of Poems) submitted to me recently a very long and careful
      review of your work, which begins with a charmingly incisive analysis of the
      Saturday Review's criticism. The essay of Noel will probably
      appear in the new Oxonian magazine "The Dark Blue." I shall
      take care to send it to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>What is this I hear of your coming over here? Is it to be so?—and if so, when?
      and for how long? When you arrive—if that 
      
       good fortune awaits
      us—you must (letting me know beforehand the ship by which you sail from
      America) come straight to my house, where you will find a small room but a large
      welcome. I hear that Tennyson has written to you, and should be
      very glad to know what he said.
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me hear from you so soon as you find it convenient.</p>
