      <br></br><br></br>My dear Edward Carpenter,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of May 14 
      rec'd, with the £3<sup><a href="#tex.00421_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Many
      thanks—I send the three L of G by same mail with this, same
      address—please notify me soon as they reach you safely—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am much as usual—Pretty well a good deal of the time—go down to the
      Staffords' farm often—was there two weeks of this month—they are
      well—have not forgotten you—Harry still works at telegraphing—
   </p>
   
   <p>I was on in Boston five weeks since—but I believe I sent you a little printed
      item of my jaunt—
   </p>
   
   <p>I sympathize with you in the loss of the dear mother—I have drunk of that
      cup—Commend me faithfully in good wishes to my unmet friends you come
      across—to Robert Sharkland, whose name I have written as you desired, in the
      Volume—
   </p>
   
   <p>Write to me as often as you can, my dear friend—&amp; I will try the same to
      you—
   </p>

   <p id="tex.00421_n2">2. Carpenter's letter is not
      known. On  Carpenter wrote from Sheffield
      what Whitman termed a "good letter": "These friends that I have here and my more
      natural open air life seem to have made a difference to me. I feel as if I had
      touched the bottom at last, and had something firm to go upon—after
      floundering about so long. Thanks for all that also to you."<a href="#r2">[back]
