      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing special with me to write to you about. The time slips away mighty
      quick. 
      It seems but a day or two since I left Wash, yet I am now on the fourth week of my
      furlough. 
      Last night was about the greatest political show I ever saw, even in New York—a grand
      
      Democratic meeting &amp; torch-light processions. I was out in the midst of them, to see
      the sights. 
      I always enjoy seeing the city let loose, and on the rampage, as it was last night
      
      to the fullest extent. I cannot begin to tell you how the Democrats showed themselves
      
      by thousands &amp; tens of thousands. The whole city was lit up with torches. 
      Cannons were fired all night in various parts of the city. As I was on my way home
      
      in a 2d av. car between 12 &amp; 1 o'clock we got blocked in by a great part of the returning
      procession. 
      Of course we had to just stand &amp; take it. I enjoyed it hugely from the front platform.
      
      They were nearly an hour passing us, streaming both sides. In the procession were
      all sorts of objects, 
      models of ships, forty or fifty feet long, full-manned, cars of liberty with women,
      
      &amp;c &amp;c. The ranks spread across the street, &amp; every body carried a blazing torch. 
      Fireworks were going off in every direction. The sky was full of big balloons, 
      letting off rockets &amp; Roman candles, 'way up among the stars. The excitement, the
      rush, 
      &amp; the endless torches, gave me great pleasure. Ever &amp; anon, the cannon, some near
      some distant. 
      I heard them long after I got to bed. It sounded like a distant engagement. 
      I send you the Herald with a sort of account of the show, but it doesn't do 
      half justice to it.<sup><a href="#loc.01588_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> The speeches were of no account at all.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you got a letter &amp; paper from me Saturday, Oct 3. I rec'd your welcome letter
      of Oct 1,<sup><a href="#loc.01588_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> also the Star.<sup><a href="#loc.01588_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I read Mr. Noyes<sup><a href="#loc.01588_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> 
      western letters with pleasure. So you have something new in RR—new officers &amp; rules.
      
      The RR business here is very different. They go through these long routes 
      on the rush—no mercy to cattle. The 3d av. RR. lost 36 horses in one day 
      last summer, one of those hot days. We are having pleasant weather just now, 
      seems like Indian summer. So long, dear Pete. From your loving comrade.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <p id="loc.01588_n2">2. Doyle concurred in Walt
      Whitman's opinion in his letter of : "i think your description of the Procession beats theirs all to
      pieces." The article in the <em>Herald</em> was lengthy (almost a
      page and one-half) but factual and colorless: "It were an unending task to
      describe in detail this monster procession."<a href="#r2">[back]

      conclusion to this letter read: "I remain well, work a little, &amp; loafe
      around a good deal, sometimes on the river, or occasionally on Broadway, or take
      a ride on top of the stage, &amp;c. Well, Pete, that is all this time
