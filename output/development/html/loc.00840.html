   <p>Could you give me a little further information about my brother Capt. George W. Whitman,
      51st New York, who gave you the slip you sent from Annapolis Feb. 19, with his &amp; mother's
      address, Feb. 14th? Why did not he, &amp; the other officers, 51st N. Y., come up with
      the main body, for exchange? Were the other officers 51st there at Danville, time
      you left? Please tell me all you know, or think probable, on this subject of why they
      did not come? Have they been sent further south, to avoid exchanging them, or are
      they still at Danville? <em>Was</em> my brother <em>really well</em> &amp; hearty? Was Lieut. Sam'l Pooley, 51st N. Y., there, &amp; how was he? Do you know whether
      my brother got letters &amp; boxes we sent him? Was he in the attempt to escape, Dec.
      10, last? My dear sir, if you could take a leisure half hour &amp; write me, <em>soon as possible</em>, what you know on these, or any points relating to my brother, it would deeply oblige
      me—address<sup><a href="#loc.00840_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Cook was a Captain
      in the 19th U.S. Colored Troops. He was held prisoner with George Washington
      Whitman, and after Howard's release he forwarded a letter from George to his
      mother. In February 1869, Walt Whitman had written Cook, who was then at home in
      New York City, for additional detail about George. Cook replied that he did not
      really know George. For more information about the exchange, see Jerome M.
      Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>

   <p id="loc.00840_n1">1. Cook replied, on the back
      of Whitman's letter (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp;
      Company, 1906–96], 3:202–203), that he assumed George was now in
      Annapolis, since all the Danville prisoners had arrived there on February 23 and
      24, 1865. George had written to his mother from the Officers' Hospital in
      Annapolis, Maryland, on . He had
      left the Danville prison on February 19, stopped at Richmond for three days, and
      arrived in Annapolis the day before. By oversight on his mother's part, George's
      letter was not sent to Whitman immediately.<a href="#r1">[back]
