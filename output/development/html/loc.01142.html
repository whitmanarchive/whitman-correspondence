      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was much disturbed by your card. I had been thinking of you as probably enjoying
      these superb autumn days down in the country at Kirkwood, &amp; here you are wretched
      &amp; sick at home. I trust you are better now. You need a change. I dearly wish that
      as soon as you are well enough 
      
      you would come up here &amp; spend a few weeks with us. We could have a good time here
      in my bark-covered shanty &amp; in knocking about the country. Let me know that you will
      come.
   </p>
   
   <p>The "Specimen Days &amp;c" came all right. I do not like the last part of the title; it
      brings me up with such a short turn. I have read most of the new matter &amp; like it
      of course. I have not seen any notices of the book yet. 
      
      I have just recd an English book—<u>Familiar Studies of men &amp; books</u>—by Stevenson with an essay upon you in it. But it does not amount to much. He has
      the American vice of smartness &amp; flippancy. I do not think you would care for the
      piece.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am bank examining nowadays, but shall be free again pretty soon.</p>
   
   <p>O'Connor writes me that he is going to pub his <u>Tribune</u> letters in a pamphlet, with some other matter; I am glad to hear it. He draws blood
      every time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I fear poor old Alcott will not rally; indeed he may be dead now. I had a pleasant
      letter from him the other day. I had sent him a crate of Concord grapes.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am very stupid to-day. For the past two weeks my head has been ground between the
      upper &amp; nether millstone of bank ledgers &amp; it is sore. We are all well. Julian is
      a fine large boy. Drop me a card when you receive this; also write me when you will
      come up.
   </p>
