   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Christopher and Maria
      Smith were the parents of Bethuel Smith, Company F, Second U.S. Cavalry, who was
      wounded in 1863 and met Whitman shortly after. He wrote to Whitman on , from the U.S. General Hospital
      at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, "I left the armory hospital in somewhat of A hurry."
      He expected, he explained on ,
      to rejoin his regiment shortly, and was stationed near Washington when he wrote
      on . He wrote on , from Culpeper, Virginia, that he
      was doing provost duty, and on ,
      he was in a camp near Mitchell Station, Virginia, where "the duty is verry
      hard." He was wounded again on June 11, 1864, as this letter states. He was
      transported to Washington, and went home on furlough on July 1. He returned on
      August 14 to Finley Hospital, where, on , he wrote to Whitman: "I would like to see you verry much, I have
      drempt of you often &amp; thought of you oftener still." He expected to leave
      the next day for Carlisle Barracks to be mustered out, and on , he wrote to Whitman from
      Queensbury, N.Y. When his parents communicated with Walt Whitman on , Bethuel was well enough to
      perform tasks on the farm. Smith was one of the soldiers to whom Whitman wrote
      ten years later; see Walt Whitman to Bethuel Smith, December 1874 (Edwin
      Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 2:318–319).
