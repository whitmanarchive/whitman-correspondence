      <br></br>My friends,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have now ready the prose article—(will make, I should think, about 14
      printed pages)—which I mentioned to W. F. Church,<sup><a href="#prc.00018_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> at an interview here not long since.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot give you any complete description of the piece—but will say that
      it takes up the subject of <em>Democracy</em> where the article by
      that name in the <em>Galaxy</em> of December, left it—and
      applies to Individuality—sketches the portrait of the ideal American of
      the future—also characterizations of the American
      woman—overhauls the Culture theory, shows its deficiencies, tested by any
      grand, practical Democratic test—argues that the main thing wanted for
      the literary, esthetic, &amp; moral areas of the United States is to institute
      what must result in copious supplies, among the masses, of healthy, acute, handsome
      Individualities, modernized, &amp; fully adapted to our soil, our days, city
      &amp; country. The name of my piece is 
      
      
      <br><br><span class="indent"><em>Personalism</em>.</span><br><br>
      
      
       Don't be alarmed at the (perhaps at first sight) oddity of the word<sup><a href="#prc.00018_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—it is the right
      title for the article, and will justify itself, &amp; remain.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The piece is a following up of <em>Democracy</em>—&amp;
      is, as a literary performance, I think better than that paper—&amp;
      will arouse more attention. Of course there is nothing in it which you would demur
      to print in the magazine.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Are your plans such that you would probably like the piece for your April number?
      Could you print it positively as the leader? Please give me definite &amp;
      immediate answers. The piece is all ready.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00018_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church
         &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York
         Public Library</em>, 61 (1957), 217–237, 281–302.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="prc.00018_n3">3. Apparently Walt Whitman
      coined the word "personalism," which Bronson Alcott introduced into American
      philosophy; see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>Walt Whitman Handbook</em>
      (Chicago: Packard and Company, 1946), 303. The essay appeared in the <em>Galaxy</em>, 5 (May 1868), 540–547, though not as the
      lead article, and was later part of <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
