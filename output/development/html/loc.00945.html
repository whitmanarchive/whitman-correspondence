      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was at the Boat at 2 Wednesday afternoon and we sailed at 5.<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> I
      <em>hoped</em>
      to see you, but feared you would not be able to go over. I was all the more sorry
      <em>not</em>
      to see you, and I inferred from it that you were too unwell to come over. Mr. Conway,
      Martin, F.<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> went to the boat with me &amp; remained an hour or so. Mr. Howells<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> having business here, made his arrangements to come that evening, so I had company, but I had
      <em>hoped</em>
      for a good long talk with
      <em>you,</em>
      &amp; hoped that you would be able to go over to the boat.
   </p>
   
   <p>How are you now, dear Walt?</p>
   
   <p>I long to hear from you. William &amp; Charlie<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> had each had two letters from you, &amp;
      <em>I not a word,</em>
      don't you know that I shall be jealous? and now this is my
      <em>third</em>
      epistle to you, so I shall claim a word from you
      <em>when</em>
      you are able to write.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      My sister &amp; Dr. Channing<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> both ask for you with the greatest interest, &amp; Jeannie<sup><a href="#loc.00945_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>, Mrs. C. says she should have written you
      <em>at once</em>
      and asked you there when I first wrote her that you were ill, if she had not been
      sick herself.
   </p>
   
   <p>Should you write me, direct to me
      <em>Care of Dr. Wm. F. Channing. Providence. R.I.</em>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am still in pursuit of a place at the sea - shall, &amp; hope to find one, for I need
      the sea.
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I
      <em>want</em>
      to hear from you, dear Walt, &amp; I hope you are gaining all the time, are you?
   </p>

      With love -

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00945_n100">1. For a time Whitman lived
      with William D. and Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor, who, with Charles W. Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an abolition novel published by Thayer &amp;
      Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor, William's wife, had a close personal
      relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with
      William over the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor
      supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William established
      a separate residence. The correspondence between Whitman and Ellen is almost as
      voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n2">2. Martin F. Conway was the
      first U.S. Congressman, a Republican, from Kansas. He had served as a vocal
      opponent to slavery—and even spent January 1, 1863, the day the Emancipation
      Proclamation went into effect, in Massachusetts with Ralph Waldo Emerson,
      William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and Julia Ward Howe. That same month,
      he introduced a resolution before Congress calling for recognition of the
      Confederacy, so that war with the South might be fought as a war between
      nations.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n3">3. Charles Joseph Howells,
      according to entries in New York Directories, must have been versatile (and
      perhaps eccentric): in 1864–1865 he was an "inventor," in 1865–1866
      an inspector in the Custom House, in 1866–1867 simply an "inspector," and
      in 1867–1868 a seller of hairpins.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n4">4. "William &amp; Charlie"
      probably refer to William Douglas O'Connor and Charles Eldridge, both of whom
      received at least two letters from Whitman in late June and early July. Charles
      W. Eldridge was one half of the Boston based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer
      and Eldridge, who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. In December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George
      in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered
      Eldridge, who had become a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and
      eventually obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the
      army paymaster. For more on Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>. This publishing duo could also be the "William
      &amp; Charlie" Ellen mentions, but there are no extant letters from Whitman to
      Thayer from this period.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n5">5. William F. Channing
      (1820–1901), son of William Ellery Channing, and also Ellen O'Connor's
      brother-in-law, was by training a doctor, but devoted most of his life to
      scientific experiments. With Moses G. Farmer, he perfected the first fire-alarm
      system. He was the author of <em>Notes on the Medical Applications
         of Electricity</em> (Boston: Daniel Davis, Jr., and Joseph M. Wightman,
      1849). Ellen O'Connor visited him frequently in Providence, Rhode Island, and
      Whitman stayed at his home in October, 1868.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00945_n6">6. Ellen O'Connor probably
      refers here to Jean O'Connor, William and Ellen's daughter.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
