   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Hay
      (1838–1905), Abraham Lincoln's private secretary and biographer, as well
      as Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of State, was an early admirer of Walt
      Whitman's poetry.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0746">1. "As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free"
      (later "Thou Mother with Thy Equal Brood") was recited at the Dartmouth
      commencement on June 26, 1872. Evidently a student organization hoped to annoy
      the faculty by inviting Walt Whitman to Dartmouth, a seat of New England
      sobriety and conservatism; see Bliss Perry, <em>Walt Whitman</em>
      (1906), 203–205. A dispatch to the New York <em>Times</em>
      on June 29, 1872, reported that Walt Whitman "was cordially met by the venerable
      gentlemen sitting upon the platform. He then took his position at the desk and
      read, with clearness of enunciation, his poem, written for the occasion, 'As a
      Strong Bird on Pinions Free.' As Mr. Whitman himself said to the writer, 'There
      is no one expression that could stand as the subject of the poem.'" For another
      first-hand report of this recitation, see Perry, <em>Walt
         Whitman</em>, 203–205. "As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free" was later
      printed as a pamphlet in 1872.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00816_n2">2. The copy of "O Captain!
      My Captain!" is dated by Walt Whitman as March 9, 1887, as is a Gutekunst
      photograph.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
