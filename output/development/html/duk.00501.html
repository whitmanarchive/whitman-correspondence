      <span class="unclear">th?</span>]
      <sup><a href="#duk.00472_n5" id="r13">13</a></sup>
      went to look at it the other day
      and decided not to build
      on it at all
      
      he and smith went to look
      at some lots yesterday<sup><a href="#duk.00501_n24" id="r14">14</a></sup>
      they liked
      very much on the corner of
      tomkins 
      avenu   and lafaette  st<sup><a href="#duk.00501_n18" id="r15">15</a></sup>
      
      george says it is very fine
      but it is a plot and the price
      is 3000 dollar  cash the turners<sup><a href="#duk.00501_n13" id="r16">16</a></sup>
      has the selling of it he has gone
      again to day to see what they
      can doo  george says he knows

      one block of the decalb  ave<sup><a href="#duk.00501_n6" id="r17">17</a></sup> cars
      if they could get it they would
      build a number of smalish  houses
      he says the neigberhood  is
      very good but he is afraid they
      cant  manage to get it
      so when i next write
      i dont  know what the progress
      will be but Walt you must
      not be alarmed if you hear
      we have bough  the
      lickfield 
      property or maybee  some of
      the shantys  on the park i often

      be contented where i could be
      at peace and not have to move

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      good bie Walter dear
      
   </p>
   
   <p>i will

   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>i will write when we

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00501_n7">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      this letter to letter May 3, 1867, and Edwin Haviland Miller dated it to letter
      May 2, 1867 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:328, n. 73; 1:378). The postscript
      echoes Walt Whitman's  letter, so
      the letter dates to early May 1867. Because the day of the week, Thursday, is in
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand, Miller is correct. The letter dates to May 2,
      1867.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n15">3. Walt Whitman arrived in
      Brooklyn on May 4, 1867, and he found his brother George Washington Whitman
      seriously ill with "malignant erysipelas, with great swelling, sore &amp; for a
      while complete blindness, now partially relieved" (see Walt Whitman's  letter to William D. O'Connor).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n9">5. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman departed for St. Louis on May 6, 1867. Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman
      sold household belongings in preparation for her mid-June departure to Towanda,
      Pennsylvania, where she and daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa resided
      temporarily with the Gordon F. Mason family. See Jeff Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman (Dennis
      Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The
         Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University
      Press, 1984], 123, n. 5).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n11">6. "Mr Bullard" was a member
      of the family moving into the 840 Pacific Street house after Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman departed from it. Because the
      Bullards wanted Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Edward to vacate also, Jeff was
      annoyed: "It seems to me d—m mean that they manage to want the whole of
      that big house It looks more like being a little ugly than anything else" (see
      Jeff's  letter to Walt
      Whitman).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n8">7. Eunice White Beecher was the
      wife of Henry Ward Beecher, the Congregational clergyman who accepted the
      pastorate of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, in 1847. Debby Applegate provides a
      profile of the minister's wife (<em>The Most Famous Man in
         America</em> [New York: Doubleday, 1996], 82, 317). Edward Whitman attended
      Beecher's Plymouth church regularly (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman). The
      Bullards were probably relatives of Eunice Beecher, who is said in this letter
      to be "responcible for" the payment of $100. Eunice Beecher's last name was
      Bullard before her marriage (Applegate, 82).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n5">8. Julius W. Mason
      (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry. Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman mentioned a J. W. Mason who "used to be in my party on the
      Water Works" in his  to Walt
      Whitman. Mason became a career army officer, and he assisted in getting supplies
      to George when he was held prisoner. Mason remained in the army until dying of
      apoplexy in 1882. His father George F. Mason was a prominent Pennsylvania
      businessman and state senator, with whom Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman stayed
      after selling her furniture in preparation for departure to St. Louis. See Jeff
      Whitman's  and  letters to Walt, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt, and Randall
      H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 37.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00479_n9">9. Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917) took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis, a lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared
      the Pacific Street house with Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, son Edward, and Jeff
      Whitman's family before Jeff departed for St. Louis, and he visited Louisa while
      serving as an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts. Davis also served briefly as
      the chief engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn
      (see Louisa's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). For Davis's work with Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880) and
      later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company
      (1880–1908). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and Edward W.
      Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston Society of
         Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00501_n14">10. Joseph P. Davis's brother
      W. S. Davis, an attorney, lived in Worcester, Massachusetts (see Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n21">11. Davis served as the chief
      engineer for Prospect Park, near the Pacific Street house in Brooklyn (see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to
      Walt Whitman).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n14">12. This lot on Putnam Avenue,
      which was purchased by George Washington Whitman's partner Smith and housed
      their carpentry shop, long occupied Louisa Van Velsor Whitman as a potential
      spot for a home. After George and his partner decided not to build there (see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman), she
      asked Walt whether he could purchase this lot so that she could have there a
      small home for herself (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00472_n5">13. A man known only as Smith
      was George Washington Whitman's partner in building houses on speculation. Walt
      Whitman described Smith as "a natural builder and carpenter (practically and in
      effect) architect," and he advised John Burroughs that Smith was an "honest,
      conscientious, old-fashioned man, a man of family . . . . youngish middle age"
      (see Walt's  letter to John
      Burroughs).<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n24">14. The many houses that are
      described in this letter, which George Washington Whitman and his partner Smith
      visited, could expand their speculative housing business and provide immediate
      housing for Louisa and son Edward.<a href="#r14">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n18">15. Tompkins and Layette Avenue
      both have the same names today. The area that George Washington Whitman and his
      partner Smith visited was in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood near
      present-day Herbert Von King Park, which was known in 1868 as Tompkins
      Square.<a href="#r15">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n13">16. A Frances G. Turner, listed
      as a builder in the 1867 <em>Brooklyn Directory</em>, was located
      at 120 Portland Avenue. No person named Turner is listed in the directory as an
      agent. A Turner family may have been familiar to the Whitman family because
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman also noted the death of a Margaret Turner, a long-time
      Brooklyn resident at 120 Portland Avenue, which is near the former Whitman home
      on Fort Greene (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt).<a href="#r16">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n6">17. DeKalb Avenue passed next to
      Fort Greene, near the previous Whitman home on Portland Avenue.<a href="#r17">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00501_n16">18. The postscript echoes Walt
      Whitman's most recent letter. He sympathized with his mother's unsettled housing
      situation and sought to extend reassurance: "about domestic matters—I
      hardly know what to say at present"; "But, Mother, you must not worry about
      it—it will be arranged some way—"; and "try to take things coolly"
      (see his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r18">[back]
