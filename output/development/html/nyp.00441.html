   <p>Ben Ticknor has just been here, to make a settlement of the L of G publication business
      between me and Osgood &amp; Co.—which settlement has been amicably effected—and O &amp; Co.
      have withdrawn &amp; given it up for good, &amp; made the plates &amp;c over to me<sup><a href="#nyp.00441_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>What I write for is this:—Ben. tells me that the whole business originated from the
      State Attorney General Mr Marston, who (at the instance of certain parties) peremptorily
      instructed the Boston Dist. Attorney Stevens to proceed against L of G. As I wrote you before, the <em>betes noir</em> were <em>To a common prostitute</em> and <em>A woman waits for me</em>. Unless those were left out he was instructed to indict and arrest to the law's extremity.
      (I believe I told you that Osgood &amp; Co. formally notified me that they would continue
      the publication if those were expurgated.)
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not myself feel any resentment toward O &amp; Co. for any thing done me or the book—They
      have acted with reference to conventional business &amp; other circumstances.<sup><a href="#nyp.00441_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      <em>Marston</em> is the target for you<sup><a href="#nyp.00441_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—If I learn more I will notify you—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00441_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answd May 20/82." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service | Bureau
      | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Camden | May | 17 | 2 PM | N.J.;
      Washington, D.C. | May | (?) | 1882 | Recd.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00441_n2">2. Ticknor, of Osgood &amp;
      Co., telegraphed on May 16 for an appointment on the following day (The Library
      of Congress). The settlement provided that Osgood turn over "the plates, dies,
      steel portrait, and 225 copies (more or less) in sheets of Leaves of Grass, and
      pay W. W. the sum of $100.00 in cash" (The Library of Congress; <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P.
      Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:298).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00441_n3">3. Though O'Connor on  approved of Whitman's "magnanimous" attitude
      toward Osgood &amp; Co., he believed that "my part, and the part of all your
      friends, is to whale them" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:14).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00441_n4">4. In his reply on , O'Connor said that he had "focussed all my
      fire right upon Oliver Stevens, who, you know, is the only one that appears
      officially in the transaction." But "when we get Marston to the front, there
      will be augmented fire for his hide, and I hope to make it so intolerable for
      him, that he will in self-defence peach on the holy citizens who have egged him
      on."<a href="#r4">[back]
