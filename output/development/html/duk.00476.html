   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00476_n7">1. This letter dates to March
      15, 1867. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter March 15, 1867, but only the
      letter "M" and day of the month "15" appear in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand.
      March 15, 1867 fell on Friday, the day that Louisa wrote. Edwin Haviland Miller
      cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). The date is consistent
      with the death of Dr. Edward Ruggles, a close friend of the Whitman family, the
      previous Sunday ("Obituary: Edward Ruggles, M.D.," <em>New York
         Herald Tribune</em>, March 12, 1867, 4).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00476_n2">3. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and his wife Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his practice and
      devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems." Walt Whitman
      enclosed a copy of Ruggles' obituary with his  letter to his mother. Green-Wood is a Brooklyn cemetery located
      southwest of Prospect Park.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00476_n5">5. This Mrs. Mason is
      presumably the wife of Gordon F. Mason of Towanda, Pennsylvania. Martha Mitchell
      "Mattie" Whitman stayed with the Mason family from June to September 1867, after
      her husband Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman departed for St. Louis (see Randall
      H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42).<a href="#r5">[back]

      "Sis" is Jessie Louisa Whitman (1863–1957), the younger daughter of
      Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman and Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Walt
      Whitman's brother and sister-in-law. At the time of this letter, she was
      approaching four years of age. For an update on the penny, see Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's  letter to
      Walt. Jessie and her elder sister Manahatta were both favorites of their
      uncle Walt.<a href="#r6">[back]
