      (1814–1819) was a Boston physician who was well acquainted with Ralph
      Waldo Emerson and James Redpath. Along with other philanthropically minded
      citizens, Russell sent Whitman money to be used in easing the suffering of the
      Civil War wounded languishing in the Washington, D.C., area. See Russell's
      letter to Whitman from . Russell's
      letter to Redpath appears in Thomas Donaldson's <em>Walt Whitman
