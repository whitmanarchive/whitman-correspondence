   <p>Han is improving although very nervous: I suggested a
      dress: common, cheap calico one ready made which cannot be procured here: She has
      two or three cut: one late last spring: others years ago: She is unfortunate, 
      proceeds so far with one, then 
      puts it aside: no service 
      to her now—She managed to wash an
      old one a few days ago: put it on: She has a craze for painting old woollen table
      covers, for effect [
      <span class="unclear">in?</span>]
      
      her small parlor: procured some vermillion for her and gave her a brush: mixed the paint: she
      covered her arms and hands with it: body of her dress, and some on the skirt:
      daubs chair backs,
      and things generaly: I must humor her: her mind must have occupation: I put down her
      winter carpet on Sun. She is much
      pleased: [
      <span class="unclear">retoned?</span>]
       her
      oil cloth: shall black and put up her stove: then I shall run two coal fires
      constantly. Weather pleasant at times—then furious, blustering—freezing
      hard.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a French-born
      landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman (1823–1890), Walt
      Whitman's sister, and they lived in Burlington, Vermont. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of
      Hannah. For more information about Heyde, see Steven Schroeder, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_96.html">Heyde, Charles Louis (1822–1892)</a>," <em>Walt
