   <p>Thanks &amp; God bless you my dear Sylvester Baxter for your kind project for
      me—(whether it comes to a fulfilment or not)<sup><a href="#bpl.00011_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>—I am feeling pretty well as I write—Should most gratefully accept &amp;
      most intensely enjoy a little spot of my own to live in 6 or 8 months of the 12 in
      country air, so pined for by me—As it is I cannot go to a hotel,— nor
      visiting either—although I have many &amp; kindest invitations—I want a
      cheap ¼ or ½ acre &amp; 4-or-5-room house, spot &amp; design selected by
      myself—
   </p>
   
   <p>—If convenient let Sloane Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; Dr Bartol<sup><a href="#bpl.00011_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> read this—&amp; God bless you all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Sylvester Baxter (1850–1927)
      was on the staff of the Boston <em>Herald</em>. Apparently he met
      Whitman for the first time when the poet delivered his Lincoln address in Boston
      in April, 1881; see Rufus A. Coleman, "Whitman and Trowbridge," <em>PMLA</em> 63 (1948), 268. Baxter wrote many newspaper columns
      in praise of Whitman's writings, and in 1886 attempted to obtain a pension for
      the poet. For more, see Christopher O. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_85.html">Baxter, Sylvester [1850–1927]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="bpl.00011_n1">1. Whitman's friend William
      Sloane Kennedy (see following note) had proposed the idea of building the poet a
      "summer 'shanty'" on the farm land owned by George and Susan Stafford (parents
      of Whitman's young friend Harry Stafford), a place Whitman often visited in the
      summer. Baxter took charge of raising funds for the project in and around
      Boston. See William Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt
         Whitman</em> (1896), 10–11.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
