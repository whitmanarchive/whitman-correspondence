      <br></br><br></br>My Dear Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received a Postal card from you yesterday. I wrote to you a long time ago, two letters,
      [illegible] both have been unanswered untill now. I was afraid you might be very sick, and unable
      to write, and so became [
      <span class="unclear">very?</span>]
       anxious about you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am glad however that it is not so. I was to New York a couple of weeks ago, and
      saw Uncle George. He is still in the Stand, working for J. &amp; D.J. Ryer. He said he
      had [illegible]
      
      <sup><a href="#loc.01950_" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      <sup><a href="#loc.01950_" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
      
      
      also but without an answer. He told me he was afraid something was wrong with you
      so you see you are not forgotten. I often think of you, and how I would like to come
      and see you or have you to do the same to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>However if all goes well untill July 4th,/76, I expect to come to Philadelphia, to celebrate the Centennial. when you write, tell me all you know about the arrangements that have been made, &amp;c, if
      it is fair weather, tomorrow, (which is
      
      
      
      very doubtful) our Sunday School, together with Six others is to have a rail road
      [
      <span class="unclear">Exorcise?</span>]
       to Haverstien, a town about 20 miles, north from here.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all enjoying [illegible] good health this Summer  and I wish you could pick up again and come out and spend
      a few weeks with us, and Uncle John, who lives only about a mile off. I am very sure
      we would all be glad to see you come. Remember it is not amongst strangers but as
      it [
      <span class="unclear">were?</span>]
       your own folks. So take co[illegible]
      
      
      
      in your next letter appoint a time when you will come, and then stick to it.
   </p>
   
   <p>You can ride with in [
      <span class="unclear">a mile?</span>]
       from the [
      <span class="unclear">house?</span>]
       with the cars, where we will meet you with a Horse and carriage, write to me soon.
