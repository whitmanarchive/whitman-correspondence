      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours received<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—We are all very joyful over what you wrote in regard to George—It seemed to put new
      life in mother—I went to see the Dr<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to-day—He said immediately that he would go and see Swinton<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> and talk with him about the matter and urge him to write to Gen Grant &nbsp;The Dr. thinks
      that Swinton will do it and that Grant will grant the request—He seemed to feel very
      sanguine about it—Oh I so hope that we will prove successful in getting George exchanged
   </p>
   
   <p>I was glad to see that Mason<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> made a response to your asking him to send supplies to George—I intend to send a
      box this week if I can
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The enclosed letter<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> came to the house for you &nbsp;Mother opened it—I thought I would send it to you and
      you could tell me if any more of the same style came whether to send them to you or
      not—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are now having quite a snow storm—it looks as if it would be quite deep—I am rather
      sorry to see it for it looks hard for the soilders &nbsp;I feel disappointed in regard to the peace talks.<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I was in hopes that we had had war enough &nbsp;It seems almost impossible that the south
      can keep up the fight much longer—however I think the president showed a great deal
      of cuteness in going down to see them and if he only told them that the Union was
      all he asked [he showed] more statesmanship than I ever gave him credit for &nbsp;I see that a great many here have not yet given up the idea but what there is something
      more to come—the desire for a peace on the basis of the Union alone seems so far as
      I can see meets with universal applause
   </p>
   
   <p>Well Walt so you have gone to keeping house<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> have you &nbsp;You must be car[e]ful or you will get sick again—I fear you do not live
      well—I think the great cause of good health is good eating—Keep up the supply of good
      things—Do you have about the same experience in the Hospitals as you used to—were
      the men glad to see you back—were any remaining that you used to visit &nbsp;if so I know
      they were glad to see you—and it must seem like old times for you to go among them—Do
      you see many of the friends that you used to know then—I suppose you visit the Hospitals
      once a day—are there as many in them as there used to be—I hope not—tis so long since
      we have had any very large battles that I should suppose the Hospita[l]s were not
      full<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What is it about the Exchange of prisoners—do you know it looks to me as if they were
      trying to delay the exchange and yet talk about it as if they were going to do it
      and wished to do it all the time—I was very glad to have you write that Hichcock said
      Butler lied<sup><a href="#loc.00436_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>—I thought as much but did not dare to believe it either &nbsp;I do hope that Grant will
      make an exchange—The people seem almost to demand it—Do talk it up—Walt—write it up
      if you have a chance—One thing I think I see and that is that whoever does delay it
      that they are pretty well frightened about it and want to humbug the people with the
      idea that they are going to exchange at once—I was almost overjoyed a few nights since
      to see a dispatch that the President had ordered a complete and general exchange—but
      alas it turned out to be nothing
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother is quite well—Mat and the babies are well and all send their love—the baby
      often calls "Walt" to come &nbsp;Write me
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00436_n1">1. Whitman's letter of
      about February 6, 1865, is not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n2">2. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie Whitman. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest
      in his practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles
      Gems" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n3">3. Swinton had already
      written a letter to Grant on February 6, 1865. See Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt
      from .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n4">4. See Jeff's letter to
      Walt from . By February 10, 1865,
      Julius W. Mason, a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry, had sent a box to
      George and had promised Whitman that the poet's letter to his imprisoned brother
      would be sent by the first flag of truce. See Mason's  letter to Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n5">5. Unidentified.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n6">6. On February 3, 1865,
      Lincoln and his Secretary of State Wiliam H. Seward met with Vice-President of
      the Confederacy Alexander H. Stephens on the Union transport <em>River Queen</em> lying in Hampton Roads. All through 1864 Lincoln had
      insisted that he would consider any peace plan that included restoration of the
      Union <em>and</em> the emancipation of all slaves; he now also
      demanded a complete end to the war, refusing to consider a temporary cessation
      of hostilities. Lincoln's last requirement frustrated the Southerners' desire
      for an armistice, which would, they hoped, allow for a cooling of passions
      before the beginning of negotiations. The meeting ended with no agreement
      reached.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n7">7. In his letter of , Whitman briefly described the
      comfortable room he rented from "a very friendly old secesh landlady whose
      husband &amp; son are off in the Southern army."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n8">8. The hospitals were
      fairly full because, as Whitman noted, some soldiers remained with "bad old
      lingering wounds" while others were moved to Washington as field hospitals were
      dismantled. See Whitman's letter to Abby H. Price from .<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00436_n9">9. Major General Ethan
      Allen Hitchcock (1798–1870), military advisor to Lincoln and U.S.
      commissioner for the exchange of prisoners, had long feuded with Butler (see
      Jeff Whitman's letter to Walt from ) over the question of exchanging prisoners. He may have pointed
      out to Whitman that Grant was not solely responsible for the exchange policy
      because Stanton and Lincoln shaped it also.<a href="#r9">[back]
