   <p>I rec'd your letter yesterday—nothing very new with me—am better than I was when 
      I wrote you before—shall return to Washington next week somewhere about the middle
      of the week.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, you must try to keep good heart—Perhaps this will find you at work again—if
      not, you must keep up a cheerful heart, all the same—I have just been spending 
      a couple of hours with Joaquin Miller—I like him real well<sup><a href="#loc.01738_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
