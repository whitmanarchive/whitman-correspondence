      good friend of mine) and one of my little boys drove yesterday to Delaware (15 ms.)
      had dinner and spent some hours with a Mr Gibson, stockbreeder there, and got back
      home at 9:45 P.M. It was a charming day—ripe grain in the fields—apples
      hanging thick in the 
      orchards—clouds diving overhead—long swells of hill &amp; valley often a
      prospect of several miles ahead or at one side or other of the road—a good team, free
      travelers—altogether a grand day—today up to my eyes in work again, but
      feel like it and enjoy it—next month the annual report once more (it seems one
      annual report fairly treads on the heels of the one in advance of it) such is life,
      but what matter—if time flies—(as it does) is there not plenty of it?
      "We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers, there are trillions
      ahead and trillions ahead of them"<sup><a href="#n6140" id="r3">3</a></sup> so what matter?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4284">1. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
