   <p>I am delighted to please you in so trifling a matter as signing the pictures for your—and
      my—English friends—(substituting portraits I like better, instead of those 
      you sent, which I don't like—though they are fine bits of work.) . . .

   <p id="med.00423_n2">2. According to the New York
      Directory of 1874–1875, Gillette, which Whitman spelled Gilette (see
      Whitman's  letter to Gillette),
      was a clerk in the county courthouse. An undated entry in one of Walt Whitman's
      address books (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of
      Congress, Notebook #108) indicates that Gillette was at one time employed in the
      postmaster's office in New York.<a href="#r2">[back]
