   <p>I 
      rec'd
      
       your letter 
      to-day
      
      , and I also 
      rec'd
      
       your letter of Tuesday, (as I wrote Wednesday)—I will write a few lines to
      Lillie,<sup><a href="#tex.00338_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> (mostly for Aunt Sally Mead)<sup><a href="#tex.00338_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got a good letter from Jeff<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r4">4</a></sup> yesterday<sup><a href="#tex.00338_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—Mother, Jeff is
      evidently feeling composed &amp; well—of course he feels Matty's<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r6">6</a></sup> death very seriously,
      but I think he has recovered from the shock, and attends to his business as well as
      ever—They seem to be well situated at the Buckley's—Jeff writes quite a good
      deal about you—he writes about Mat's death—about her wishing to see us before
      she died—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this seated at my desk in the office—I come over to the office about
      12—I do not feel very well, most of the time, but have spells when I feel much better,
      generally evening—I think the sun affects me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, we—I and the doctor—have talked much of the electric battery
      treatment<sup><a href="#tex.00338_n4" id="r7">7</a></sup>—but as long as the head is affected, (the
      brain &amp; nerves) they say it must not be applied, for it will do more harm than good,
      might cause convulsions—My doctor, Dr. Drinkard, says he will use it as soon as he
      feels it will do good—but the time has not come yet—I believe I told you I am
      taking iron, strychnia &amp; quinine to give strength—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to Jeff yesterday—I send you Harper's Weekly<sup><a href="#n0290" id="r8">8</a></sup>, 
      to-day
      
      , mother, it is quite interesting—I still hold my mind about getting a house
      here &amp; <em>shall certainly do so</em><sup><a href="#tex.00338_n5" id="r9">9</a></sup>—At
      present my great hope is to get well, to get so I can walk, &amp; have some use of my
      limbs—I can write, pretty well, and my mind is clear, but I cannot walk a block, &amp;
      have no power to do any thing, in lifting or moving any thing in my room, or at my
      desk—Still I keep good spirits, better far than I would have supposed myself, knowing
      that I shall get all right in time—I know <em>how much worse</em> things
      might be in my situation than they are, &amp; feel thankful enough that they are as well
      as
      they are—Mother, I was glad to get your letter of Tuesday, April 1. I have been
      reading the wreck of the <em>Atlantic</em> April 1st<sup><a href="#tex.00338_n6" id="r10">10</a></sup>—I think it the saddest thing I ever read—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, mama dear, I will close—I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—Love to
      you, dear mother, &amp; to all—it is now about ½ past 1 Friday afternoon—I
      wrote to you Wednesday 2d April, which I suppose you got.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0705">1. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00338_n1">2. Lillie Townsend was, like Priscilla
      Townsend (see Whitman's  letter to
      his mother), presumably a cousin of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00338_n2">3. Sarah Mead was Walt Whitman's maternal
      grandmother's sister. Mead was at the time over ninety years old.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0710">4. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00338_n3">5. Here Walt Whitman summarized Jeff's letter
      of .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0707">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00338_n4">7. At the request of Ellen O'Connor, his
      sister-in-law, Dr. Channing sent to Walt Whitman on , a copy of his 1849 treatise on medical electricity,
      but warned against premature use of electric shock: "In a word electricity must
      not be used while there is <em>existing lesion</em> of the brain
      or nerve centres. . . . premature use of electricity . . . may induce
      congestion, apoplexy or convulsions."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0290">8. <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>
      (sometimes <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> or simply <em>Harper's</em>) was established in 1850 by Henry J. Raymond and
      Fletcher Harper. The magazine published several of Walt Whitman's poems,
      including "" and "." In 1857, Fletcher Harper founded <em>Harper's Weekly</em> (subtitled "A Journal of Civilization"),
      which gained its fame for its coverage of the Civil War and its publication of
      cartoonist Thomas Nast's (1840–1902) work. For Whitman's relationship with
      these two publications, see "" and "."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00338_n5">9. Walt Whitman also referred to the
      possibility of purchasing a house in Washington; see his  letter to Mannahatta Whitman and his  and , 1873 letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00338_n6">10. The first reports of the sinking of the
      steamship <em>Atlantic</em> spoke of the loss of 700 lives. On
      April 3, 1873, the New York <em>Times</em> noted that the number
      was 546. Later a board of inquiry attributed the disaster to dereliction of duty
      on the part of the captain.<a href="#r10">[back]
