   <p>Your card of 20th<sup><a href="#loc.07129_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came to hand yesterday
      afternoon—I am glad to hear good accounts of the "belly-ache" that it is
      passing off, may it stick to it and pass off altogether! Two days ago the "Address"
      promised me by Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r3">3</a></sup> came to hand—this morning I read
      it slowly and carefully, it is a wonderful revelation, which he gives there and I
      have been more moved by that ½ hour's reading than I have been by any thing for
      a long time. I want you to send me Wallace's letter back (please don't forget) and
      if you wd like to read the "Address" I will have a copy made of it for you. I have
      been reading again and again "The Sun-Set Breeze"<sup><a href="#loc.07129_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> and am
      amazed more and more at its depth and subtlety.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6121">3. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
