   <p>Much the same with me. No further news of O'Connor, (I forward the "Transcripts"<sup><a href="#duk.00834_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> you send me, to him.) Rhys writes me that the Walter
      Scott, Eng[lish] pub's, will bring out my "Spec: Days" in one vol. &amp; "Dem:
      Vistas, &amp;c" in another.<sup><a href="#duk.00834_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I have just sent on a little
      preface to S D. I forward a Peora paper—when you have read it, mail to Dr
      Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r4">4</a></sup> I have just had an autograph hunter visitor, but with cheery talk and
      presence.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="duk.00834_n2">3. Rhys mentioned on  that separate publication of the
      two works was about to be considered by the publisher. Whitman noted sending to
      Rhys a two-page preface to <em>Specimen Days</em> on March 8 and
      an "Additional Note" on March 15 (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.]). In the same (missing) letter he included a receipt
      for the ten guineas which he had received on March 14 from Walter Scott.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">4. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
