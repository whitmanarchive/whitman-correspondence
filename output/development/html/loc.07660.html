   <p>A perfect day—sunny cool—I felt easier this morning when I got
      up—(anticipate better feelings when the cooler weather comes—but we
      shall see)—Mr and Mrs Edward Coates<sup><a href="#n4187" id="r2">2</a></sup> have been over to see me—a cheery
      nice little visit—her atmosphere &amp; talk were medicinal &amp;
      inspiriting—he bo't the centennial ed'n—$10—I have had a good

      little "Old Age's Lambent Peaks" appears in the just out <em>Century</em><sup><a href="#loc.07660_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Maurice, I should like you to have my mare Nettie and
      phaeton (if it should come in) as pay for the $200 I owe you<sup><a href="#loc.07660_n3" id="r7">7</a></sup>—<em>I am deliberate ab't

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Dr R M Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden,

   <p id="n4187">2.  Edward and Florence Earle Coates
      visited Whitman at his Camden home a number of times, and he was quite fond of
      their company. Florence (1850–1927) was a well-known and widely published
      poet and a friend of the English essayist and poet Matthew Arnold, who
      frequently visited the Coates' home in Germantown, Philadelphia. Edward
      (1846–1921) was a businessman and widely admired patron of the arts, who
      chaired the Committee on Instruction at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
      Arts, where he worked closely with artist Thomas Eakins. Whitman expressed great
      admiration for Florence Earle Coates; see, for example, Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.26.html">Thursday, August 9, 1888</a>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.07660_n2">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      wrote on . Traubel reports that "W.
      was very much moved by O'Connor's letter" (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.49.html">Saturday, September 1, 1888</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">5. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.07660_n4">6. Whitman's poem "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00135.html">Old Age's Lambent Peaks</a>" appeared in the September issue of <em>The Century Magazine</em>.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07660_n3">7. On  Bucke wrote that Whitman owed him
      nothing—"(the balance is the other way)"—and suggested that he sell
      the horse in Camden.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3999">8. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">9. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and
            Commentary</a>.</em><a href="#r9">[back]
