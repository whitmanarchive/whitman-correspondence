   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Horace Furness (1833–1912) was the distinguished editor of the Variorum
      Shakespeare, and was one of the honorary pallbearers at Whitman's funeral.
      See also Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.73.html">Sunday, January 12, 1889</a>. On  Whitman sent Furness a copy of "O Captain! My Captain!" (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). See also Whitman's  letter to
      Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell. Furness was somewhat snide in a letter he wrote to
      Edmund Gosse on 29 March 1892, three days after the poet's death: "Let us
      hope that he is now more favourably situated than erstwhile for giving a
      'yawp over the roofs of the world.' I should be sorry to think that the yawp
      would reverberate through our cellars.<br><br>
      "I'm not sure that the very best of Walt was not his Jovian looks. Latterly
      when I used to see him in his room, with that majestic avalanche of a beard
      flowing in snowy luxuriousness over his broad chest, it was not hard to
      convert his blue wrapper into blue sky and the vast &amp; innumerable
      newspapers piled knee deep around him in[to] the clouds of Olympus. And, oh,
      the lot of funny stories about him, gossip pure &amp; simple but nourishing,
      which 'twould take too long to write &amp; must be reserved for the pleasant
      time when you &amp; I can ha'e a crack thegither" (Clifton Waller Barrett
      Literary Manuscripts Collection, University of Virginia).
