      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you would apply to the Librarian of Congress's office for the copyright at
      once—take it out of course in your own name—send the enclosed printed
      title page—&amp; ask for a certificate—it is $1—(50¢ for
      entry &amp; 50 for cert[ificate].)<sup><a href="#nyp.00489_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Every thing is going on well—but slowly with the book. It will be out last of
      the month. I shall send you an earliest copy or two. The publisher McKay told me to
      say to you that you can have at half price ($1) whatever number of copies you
      want "for personal or literary use"—Dr Bucke is absent from London on official
      business—(though I believe it is about time for him to return)—At last
      accounts John Burroughs was home in Delaware county, recuperating in the maple sugar
      woods—he was better—
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you see in the Heywood trial, the Judge peremptorily ruled out the 
      L of G
      
       slips part of the indictment—(which ruling out "was received with
      applause") &amp; H was afterwards on the remaining part or parts acquitted. So
      A[nthony] C[omstock] retires with his tail intensely curved inwards.<sup><a href="#nyp.00489_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I am just starting for two or three days down in my Jersey woods retreat.

   <p>The Doctor took a decided dislike to having the Latin motto on title
      page—so at his request I left it out—(I partly coincided with
      him)<sup><a href="#nyp.00489_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00489_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd April 17/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Treasury | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. | Apr 14 83 |
      1 PM; Washington, Recd. | Apr | 15 | 4 30 AM | 1883 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00489_n2">2. On February 19 Richard
      Maurice Bucke wrote to O'Connor: "If you do not object we are going to copyright
      the book in America in <em>your name</em> as we cannot in <em>mine</em>—Shall of course copyright in own name in
      England" (The Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00489_n3">3. O'Connor was vehement in
      his denunciation of Comstock on April 17: "He ought to be crushed, signally,
      publicly, in the interest of free letters and the rights of thought; he ought to
      be nailed up, like a skunk to a barn-door, as an example to deter. . . . It is
      nothing less than a public—national—infamy, that an infamous dog
      like this, convicted of such practices—a decoy duck, a dirty stool
      pigeon—should be in the employ of the United States" (Syracuse University;
      Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1953], 4:91).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00489_n4">4. The title page originally
      contained a quotation from Lucretius, the excision of which disappointed
      O'Connor. Whitman, however, fibbed, for on May 28 Bucke wrote: "I see now that
      you were right about the Latin motto (as about everything else)" (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r4">[back]
