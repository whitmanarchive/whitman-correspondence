   </p>
   
   
   <p>I met a [
      <span class="unclear">mutual?</span>]
       friend last evening who informed me he had just procured your books from you by mail.
      And I directed him, since he had been so fortunate and understood how to do it, to
      write at once for me and have the books sent to the Windsor Hotel.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Well I am <u>not</u> living at the Windsor, and in fact have no fixed abode. Besides I want your name
      written in the books if not asking to much for so little. And so on reflection I have decided to write you [
      <span class="unclear">for?</span>]
       when you receive my order through Mr. Johnson, you will please write in the books,
      saying [
      <span class="unclear">they are?</span>]
       from you to me, and then lay them to one side and I will call and get them next month.
      For when the Centennial opens I want to bring you some friends who are so anxious
      to visit the good [
      <span class="unclear">old?</span>]
       the <u>great</u> gray Poet.

   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>P.S. Of course it is [
      <span class="unclear">idle?</span>]
       for me to congratulate you on your [
      <span class="unclear">accession?</span>]
       to immortality and your well deserved renown. I will only say that my Soul and my
      sympathy all go out toward you and I often think of you as the one lone [
      <span class="unclear">tree?</span>]
       that tops us all, [
      <span class="unclear">battered?</span>]
       by storm once blown but still holding [
      <span class="unclear">your plume?</span>]
      , serene and [
      <span class="unclear">satisfied?</span>]
      . Hoping to see you early in May goodbye and the gods be with you. Joaquin

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.
