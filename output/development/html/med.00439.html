   </p>
   
   
   <p>(Somehow the Mr does not come well before Walt Whitman). I am glad to hear from you
      again &amp; to learn that at any rate you are no worse than when you last wrote,
      &amp; that though your health be shattered your good spirits flourish up like a
      plant from broken ground, glad also that you find something to approve of in a work
      so utterly unlike your own as my Queen Mary.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am this morning starting with my wife &amp; Sons on a tour
      to the Continent. She has been very unwell for two years, obliged always to lie down
      &amp; incapable of any work in consequence of
      overwork—the case of so many in this age, yours among
      others &amp; we are now going into a land of fuller sunshine in hopes that it may
      benefit her. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am in an extreme hurry, packing up &amp; after these few words must bid you
      goodbye, not without expressing my hope however that you will ultimately recover all
      your pristine vigor. I shall be charmed to receive your book.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.
