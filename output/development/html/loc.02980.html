      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thank you for papers sent, &amp; for all loving thought. I hope you are "holding your
      own."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I must have gained a little here, for I sleep more, and have a better appetite. I
      am
      going to be weighed, I weighed 95 the day before I left Washington. I write now especially
      to tell you that I intend to leave here next Monday, Sept. 16, unless a storm should
      present. We have to go to Eastport 12 miles by wagon, &amp; then take steamer to
      Boston. If it is stormy, Mrs. [
      <span class="unclear">Porter?</span>]
       says we must take the next boat, that would be Sept. 18,
      Wednesday. But in any case after you get this letter, my address will be care of my
      nephew in Boston which I will give in a separate slip. I shall make a few short
      stops with nieces &amp; [illegible] till I
      return home, &amp; as my nephew is a fixture, he will forward any thing to me
      wherever I am. I shall not go home till into October I think. We have had such a wet
      &amp; rainy summer there that I know I better wait a while. I <u>dread</u>, dear Walt, I can't tell any one how much I dread the going back
      home. I say <u>home</u>, but the sense of loneliness that
      overtakes me when I think of going is heart-sickening. And the uncertainty of all
      adds to it. If I were sure that I could make any arrangement to keep a home, I
      should feel better, but all is as cloudy &amp; misty. But I try to keep up a good
      heart, &amp; not to worry my friends with my troubles.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have one hope that I am clinging to, and that is that my sister Mrs. Channing
      may come on. She
      has not been East since they went to Cal. five years next month, &amp; she wants to
      come if their finances will allow, &amp; it will be the greatest comfort &amp; help
      to me, as she can advise me better than any one, what to do, &amp; help me about
      disposing of William's<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup> papers &amp; c. He left all to me
      absolutely, but I should be so glad of help in many matters, &amp; wish I had any
      one near at hand who could advise with me.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you think there is
      any <u>good</u> picture of William: one that you really like?
      Appleton has sent for me for the Encyclopedia, &amp; I have not the one that I like
      best here with me, &amp; the <u>best</u> of the late ones is not
      to <u>my</u> mind. How do you like the one in "The Great
      Cryptogram?"<sup><a href="#loc.07491_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Thanks for the papers. Critic came yesterday with the Hawthorne letters. I was glad
      to see them.
   </p>
   
   <p>You will see what a remote place this is, &amp; how protected the shore when I tell you that
      the heavy sea of last Sunday &amp; Monday did not reach us. It is the only seashore
      place that I ever touched where there is never any surf.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good by.</p>

   <p>I have a picture of William taken long ago that I like <u>very
         much</u> but would it be as satisfactory to the friends generally as the
      later ones, taken from years ago?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
