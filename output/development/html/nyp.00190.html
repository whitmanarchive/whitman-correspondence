      <br></br><br></br>Dear comrade
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have rec'd your letter of the 6th as it has been sent on to me by Major Hapgood.
      My dear comrade, I have been very sick, and have been brought on home nearly three
      weeks ago, after being sick some ten days in Washington—The doctors say my sickness
      is from having too deeply imbibed poison into my system from the hospitals—I had spells
      of deathly faintness, &amp; the disease also attacked my head &amp; throat pretty seriously—
   </p>
   
   <p>The doctors forbid me going any more into the hospitals—I did not think much of it,
      till I got pretty weak, &amp; then they directed me to leave &amp; go north for change of
      air as soon as I had strength—But I am making too long a story of it—I thought only
      to write you a line—My dear comrade, I am now over the worst of it &amp; have been getting
      better the last three days—my brother took me out in a carriage for a short ride yesterday
      which is the first I have been out of the house since I have been home—the doctor
      tells me to-day I shall soon be around which will be very acceptable—This is the first
      sickness I have ever had &amp; I find upon trial such things as faintness, headache &amp;
      trembling &amp; tossing all night, &amp; all day too, are not proper companions for a good
      union man like myself—
   </p>
   
   <p>Lewy, I dont know any news to send you—the acc'ts here to-night are that the railroad &amp; telegraph
      between Baltimore &amp; Washington are cut, &amp; also between Philadelphia by the rebel invasion<sup><a href="#nyp.00190_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear boy, you say you would like to see me—well I would give any thing to see your
      face again too—I think of you often—tell Jo Harris &amp; Bartlett<sup><a href="#nyp.00190_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I have not forgotten them—
   </p>
   
   <p>And now good bye, Lewy, &amp; accept my heartfelt &amp; true love, my dearest comrade—&amp; I
      will try to write again before a great while &amp; tell you how I am getting along, &amp;
      which way I expect to move, &amp;c. And I hope you will do the same to me—
   </p>
   
   <p>So good bye again, Lew, &amp; God bless you, dear son, now &amp; through life—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's letter from 
      . The following
      September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was appointed Chief
      of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until his retirement
      in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was prepared by Brown's
      family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)Brown had written from the
      Judiciary Square Hospital in an attempt to locate Whitman. Usually inarticulate,
      Brown was deeply moved in his reply to Whitman on : "I was also very sory to hear of your illness &amp; to think
      that it was brought on by your unselfish kindness to the Soldiers. There is a
      many a soldier now that never thinks of you but with emotions of the greatest
      gratitude &amp; I know that the soldiers that you have bin so kind to have a
      great big warm place in their heart for you. I never think of you but it makes
      my heart glad to think that I have bin permited to know one so good."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00190_n2">1. In his letter of , Brown gave a colorful firsthand
      account of the attempted invasion of Washington. He had hobbled to the front on
      his crutches and had remained there until witnesses near him were killed. John
      Burroughs was also a participant in this skirmish; see Burroughs's letter to
      Whitman from .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00190_n3">2. Brown, on , reported that he had not seen Adrian
      Bartlett and Joseph Harris since they returned from a spree to Baltimore on July
      4. According to his letter of ,
      the three young men were living in a Washington boardinghouse; Harris was not in
      good health, and Bartlett worked in the Treasury Department. Harris enclosed a
      letter with Brown's on . Brown
      and Bartlett were still clerks in the Treasury on May 30, 1867; see "Letter from
      Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, 30 May 1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
