      <br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send the article on Democracy. If satisfactory I should like $100 for it. You are
      to issue it in <em>Galaxy</em> with exclusive possession of the field,
      say for three months—after which I reserve to myself the right of any further use
      of
      it—as, for instance, issuing it with added Notes, Appendices, &amp;c. in a pamphlet
      or small book—published by you, of course, if you are willing—I to receive copyright
      fee on sales, &amp;c. &amp;c.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But we can see better how the cat jumps after the article is before the public—&amp;
      will leave that question open until then.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please have it set up forthwith, read carefully by copy, &amp; then, after
      correction, send me <em>two good proofs</em>. I want it to go forth in
      a perfect verbal &amp;c. condition.
   </p>

   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Please acknowledge this, immediately on reception.</p>
   
   
   <p>If any thing could be made by disposing of advance sheets in London, to any
      magazine or publisher, I would suggest that it be done—the price procured to be
      divided equally between you &amp; me.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Francis Pharcellus Church
      (1839–1906) established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866 with his
      brother William Conant Church (1836–1917). Financial control of the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon &amp; Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. Francis
      Church wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em>, "Yes, Virginia, there
      is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952), 332–350;
