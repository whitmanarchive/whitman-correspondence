   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pml.00056_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Mrs. Ann Gilchrist | 12 Well Road Hampstead | London England. It is postmarked:
      Camden | May | 27 | 5 PM | N.J.; Philadelphia | May | 27 | 1883 | Pa.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00056_n2">2. Mrs. Gilchrist wrote on
      May 6 (The Library of Congress; <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist
         and Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday, Page &amp;
      Company, 1918], 215–216), and Herbert on April 29 (<em>The
         Letters</em>, 213–214). When Anne Gilchrist replied to Whitman on July
      30, she was unexpectedly (and sensibly) critical of Bucke's biography: she
      particularly objected to "carefully gathering together again all the rubbish
      stupid or malevolent that has been written of you" and to "all that unmeaning,
      irrelevant clatter about what Rabelais or Shakespeare or the ancients &amp;
      their times tolerated in the way of coarseness or plainness of speech" (The
      Library of Congress; <em>The Letters</em>, 217). She also
      forwarded to Whitman her recent biography of Mary Lamb (1883). She wrote again
      on  (<em>The
         Letters</em>, 220–222). Apparently Whitman did not reply to either
      letter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00056_n3">3. The biography was
      published in London on June 15 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00056_n4">4. Richard Maurice Bucke
      included extracts from Anne Gilchrist's article in <em>The
         Radical</em> from May, 1870 (204–206).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pml.00056_n5">5. Whitman was with the
      Staffords from May 12 to 15 (Whitman's Commonplace Book).<a href="#r5">[back]
