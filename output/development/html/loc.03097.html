   </p>
   
   
   <p>You are always "so confoundedly in the right" that one's words—if any are
      spoken—must be monotonously words of praise. Your political note—printed
      today in "jottings" pleased me immensely. I voted for the Independent candidates
      here in Mass. + editor Clement, Aldrich<sup><a href="#med.00763_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> + I held a
      glorification over the result throughout the country, I cheered aloud when I heard
      it. It shows how true <u>a man</u> you are that old age even can
      never catch yr nimble wits in a rut (chinese) but you adhere still to principle +
      the ideal right. We printed a selection fr yr N. Am. R. article ([illegible] Smith editorial dept writing a
      few words with it). Clement said to me after the election. "Well the country is
      worth living for now." I think we did not realize what a weight of depression of
      spirits lay on our minds before. Thank ye for the "Truth-Seeker." Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> must be cranky for the N. A. Rev. art. is one of the best you
      ever penned—ripe in wisdom + sound as a shell bark hickory nut.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00763_n1">1. Charles Aldrich
      (1828–1908) was an ornithologist, a member of the Iowa House of
      Representatives, an infantry captain in the Civil War, and founder of the Iowa
      Historical Department. He was also an avid autograph collector, especially of
      Whitman's. He was so eager that the poet termed him "a very hungry man...never
      satisfied—is always crying for more and more" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.135.html">Tuesday, August 20, 1889</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
