      50 Wellington Road,<br></br>Dublin,
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">April 12. 1873
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Thank you for the kind thought which sent me the newspaper containing good news of
      your health. It concerns me &amp; others here very much. A few days before the paper
      came I had heard for the first time—through a friend in Italy—a report
      unauthenticated that you were very seriously ill. The paragraph in the newspaper was
      therefore a relief as well as a sorrow. One's feeling about such apparent evil I
      find is very much controlled by the nature of the person to whom it befalls. Over
      &amp; under all feeling which the fact of your illness produces lies the one feeling
      (which the growth of my own way of thinking together with your poems, &amp; other
      causes have made very real &amp; strong)—that for some persons &amp; for you
      among such persons, casual misfortune or calamity is not a supreme affair. We give
      our grief to you with the reserve that after all Walt Whitman has not been  really laid hold of by
      chance &amp; change—that after all he eludes them &amp; remains altogether
      untouched. And if I should happen to live longer than you I believe I should have
      the same conviction about what death could do to you. (Other persons seem like
      pathetic little flowers who have no title to permanance of being—but such an
      aristocratic theory of the ownership of a future life ought rather to be addressed
      to Goethe than to you, whose faith is larger &amp; more charitable)—
   </p>
   
   <p>The best piece of the news about you is that you are likely to be strong again &amp;
      to continue your work. I trust <u>that</u> may be so, &amp; rely
      a good deal on your previous health &amp; vigour, &amp; on the fact that you are  not of an age which ought to discourage
      hope of full recovery. We had been looking forward with very strong satisfaction
      towards seeing you over among us this year. That I suppose cannot now be expected:
      but it may come to be a fact at some later time. One thing I will ask—that
      occasionally some friend, if not yourself, would let me hear of your health—a
      line of writing would be enough. I think Mr. Burroughs would be willing to take the
      trouble; (&amp; he would add to my gain if he would mention to me the name of
      anything you may have published since "Democratic Vistas." I think I saw some small
      collection of poems mentioned as having appeared at New York).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My wife joins with mine her love &amp; both go to you together. We are well. I have
      taken to an attempt at the making of poems since twelve months. It has always seemed
      to me more my proper work than prose, but if a sufficient experiment proves the
      reverse I shall return in a business-like fashion to prose—I mean to go on
      quietly &amp; not print any poems for three or four years at soonest. I have just
      written an article on Victor Hugo's poetry, &amp; when it is printed I will send it
      to you. There is much in common between Victor Hugo &amp; you, but if I had to
      choose between "Leaves of Grass" &amp; "La Légende des Siècles," I should
      have not a moment's hesitation in throwing away "La Légende." There is a
      certain air of self-conscious beauty or sublimity in the attitude which Victor
      Hugo's soul assumes,
      that greatly impairs their effect with me. The poems, or many of them, are not
      thoroughly simple—there is something manufactured in them—they do not
      adhere &amp; cling quite close, &amp; become an invisible part of the reader. (But I
      must stop this).
   </p>
   
   <p>I think within twelve months of publishing a volume of essays, &amp; intend to
      include the Westminster—one on your poems—(I shall remove from it one or
      two expressions which may have done you wrong with some readers, &amp; which on that
      account I regret). It happens that several of the essays will be concerned with
      democratic or republican leaders—V. Hugo—Edgar Quinet—Lamennais—Landor—Milton—Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Please before very long, if it is convenient, let me somehow hear of your health.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
