      <br></br><br></br>Robert Carter,
      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Thinking that possibly I might be itemised or briefly biographised in the Cyclopaedia
      I thought I would send you, 
      (or to Mr. Dana,)<sup><a href="#med.00438_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> the accompanying sketch—some authentic statistics, (as I find I am beginning to be
      noted, 
      &amp; they make sad work of it sometimes.)<sup><a href="#med.00438_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Leaving of course the whole thing in your hands, I should like you to get the <em>statistics</em>, the <em>fact-basis</em>, 
      right—(&amp; should you think proper can be further consulted here, or proof sent, &amp;c.)—My
      book <em>Leaves of Grass</em> 
      as now printed, is in its permanent form—My other Vol. of equal size <em>Two Rivulets</em>, (i.e. of Real and Ideal) 
      <em>will comprise all my other writings, Prose &amp; Verse</em>, &amp; is now being put into type. I am still prostrated with 
      Cerebral &amp; liver affection, but work occasionally.
      
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Robert Carter (1819–1879) was at various times
      editor of the Boston <em>Commonwealth</em>, the Boston <em>Telegraph</em>, the Boston <em>Atlas</em>, the
      Rochester <em>Democrat</em>, and <em>Appleton's
         Journal</em>. He assisted Charles A. Dana in editing the first edition of
      the <em>New American Cyclopaedia</em>, and in 1873 he was engaged
      in the revision. In 1854, Carter was a key founder of the Republican Party
      during a Free Soil Party convention, appointing John A. Andrew (1818–1867)
      as the new party's first chairman.

   <p id="med.00438_n3">2. Charles A. Dana
      (1819–1897) was the owner as well as the editor of the New York <em>Sun</em> from 1868 until his death and was at one time
      co-editor of the <em>New American Cyclopaedia</em>. Whitman
      permitted Dana to print Emerson's famous letter of 1855.<a href="#r2">[back]

      new edition ignored Whitman's letter. In 1892, however, Appleton's printed the
      "sketch" in facsimile in the <em>Annual Encyclopaedia</em>. See
