      <br></br><br></br>Dear boy and Comrade<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01586_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You say it is a pleasure to you to get my letters—well, boy, it is a real pleasure
      
      to me to write to you—I just write off-hand, whatever comes up, and, 
      as I said before, mostly about myself &amp; my own doings. [There have been some] 
      tremendous fires—the one [in] Brooklyn—eight or ten first-class steam 
      engines<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Tell Harry on No 11,<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> he would see quite a change in the 
      Fire Dep't.<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Pete, if you see Pittsburgh either tell him the following, 
      or let him have this letter, &amp; then return it to you. Write how David Stevens<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> 
      is, &amp; write how he is getting along.<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have more than I can attend to here. I find myself surrounded by friends, 
      many old ones, some new ones, some young &amp; attractive, &amp; plenty of invitations 
      &amp; amusements. I have received an invitation from a gentleman &amp; wife, friends 
      of mine, at Providence, R. I.,<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> and shall go there &amp; spend a few days latter 
      part of October. How about the cold? I hope it is well. Dear Pete, with all my 
      kind friends here &amp; invitations, &amp;c., though I love them all, &amp; gratefully 
      reciprocate their kindness, I finally turn to you, &amp; think of you there.<sup><a href="#loc.01586_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, I guess I have written enough for this time. Dear Pete, I will now bid you 
      good bye for the present. Take care of yourself, &amp; God bless you, my loving comrade.
      
      I will write again soon.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01586_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "5th letter | Oct 2. | To Pittsburgh | To Harry Hurt."<br><br>
      "Pittsburgh" was an alias for Lewis Wraymond, with whom Walt Whitman
      corresponded on . For Hurt, see
      Walt Whitman's  letter to Henry
      Hurt.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n2">2. Since this draft consists
      of scraps of paper pasted together, with vague directions to transpose passages,
      the text as here given is of necessity conjectural.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n3">3. On October 2, 1868, the
      New York <em>Times</em> reported that there had been five fires in
      stables during the week. A fire on October 1, 1868, in the stables of Tunis G.
      Bergen, a Brooklyn official acquainted with Walt Whitman, had caused damage
      estimated at $1,000 (see Walt Whitman to Tunis G. Bergen, January 15, 1849, in
      Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York:
      New York University Pres, 1961–1977], 1:37).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n4">4. On , Doyle informed Walt Whitman
      that Harry wanted information about the New York Fire Department.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n5">5. After this sentence
      appeared two notes which Walt Whitman apparently planned to expand in the
      letter: "Political meeting, at Cooper Institute—the great Hall, mostly
      under ground—conductor—pistol incident in Brooklyn."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n6">6. A driver. In an entry
      dated September 7, 1874, in an address book (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of
      Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #108), Whitman recorded a visit
      from Stevens, who was at that time a driver in Philadelphia.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n7">7. The latter part of this
      sentence originally read: "&amp; remember me particular. He is a young
      man…"<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n8">8. Walt Whitman accepted
      William Francis Channing's offer to visit Providence in Whitman's  letter to Channing.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01586_n9">9. What was evidently to be
      the next sentence was stricken: "I wish we could be together on the last trip
      this evening, &amp; have an hour with each other afterward as usual." Walt
      Whitman also excised the following: "Political excitement—banners
      stretched across the streets, &amp;c—processions—"<a href="#r9">[back]
