   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1027">1. Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
      information on Rolleston, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_104.html">Rolleston, Thomas William Hazen (1857–1920)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="uva.00476_n1">2. Karl Knortz
      (1841–1918) was born in Prussia and came to the U.S. in 1863. He was the
      author of many books and articles on German-American affairs and was
      superintendent of German instruction in Evansville, Ind., from 1892 to 1905. See
      <em>The American-German Review</em> 13 (December 1946),
      27–30. His first published criticism of Whitman appeared in the New York
      <em>Staats-Zeitung Sonntagsblatt</em> on December 17, 1882,
      and he worked with Thomas W. H. Rolleston on the first book-length translation
      of Whitman's poetry, published as <em>Grashalme</em> in 1889. For
      more information about Knortz, see Walter Grünzweig, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_100.html">Knortz, Karl (1841–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n3999">4. Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> was published in October 1888 by Philadelphia
      publisher David McKay. For more information on the book, see James E. Barcus
      Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4151">5. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
