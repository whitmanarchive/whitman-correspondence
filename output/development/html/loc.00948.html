      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was very glad to hear from you.<sup><a href="#loc.00948_n100" id="r1">1</a></sup> The letter came promptly
      last Friday with one from Wm. &amp; I wrote him yesterday, &amp; sent the book review. I
      think it is an admirable criticism, almost the best of Leaves of Grass that I have
      ever
      seen.
   </p>
   
   <p>William tells me that in the letter Curtis promises to do all he can, &amp; is very much
      interested, but most likely he has written you all about it.<sup><a href="#loc.00948_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How comes on Drum Taps?</p>
   
   
   <p>How is the little girl? I was more pained than I can tell you to learn that she was
      ill,
      and with one of those dreadful fevers. The poor little thing! Isn't it a pitiful thing
      to see a child sick? To me far more appealing than the sickness of a grown person.
   </p>
   
   <p>The critical time was Sunday last you said, now it is Tuesday, I hope she is better.
      Try
      to send me a line to say how she is.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sorry for your sake, dear Walt, that your mother is away. I know how you
      would miss her. But perhaps by this time you have gone for her. I hope you will go,
      &amp; will have a pleasant journey and visit.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have delayed writing that I might give you the latest news of Mrs. Ashton &amp; baby,
      but Charley went in there &amp; Ashton had gone home to see them.<sup><a href="#loc.00948_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Speed had returned, I think he was gone for a week. Mr.
      Pleasants said they were well when Ashton left for Philadelphia.<sup><a href="#loc.00948_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We miss you and William <em>immensely,</em> Charley &amp; I speak of you
      daily.
   </p>
   
   <p>Miss Howard's sister Sallie is very sick, I think typhoid fever, &amp; I have been out
      to-day trying to get a nurse for her.<sup><a href="#loc.00948_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> So far Garaphelia has
      taken care of her night &amp; day, &amp; she looks worn out.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are well, so is Charley. Jeannie sends love. She was very sorry &amp; sympathizing
      about little California. I trust the little thing is better.
   </p>
   
   <p>My sister Jeannie's little Mary is very sick with typhoid fever too, but they hope not dangerously
      so.
   </p>
   
   <p>We shall be glad to welcome you back, but while you are away I hope you will have
      a good
      time, &amp; get very well.
   </p>
   
   <p>Good by.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00948_n100">1. For a time Whitman lived
      with William and Ellen O'Connor, who, with Eldridge and later Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of <em>Harrington</em>, an
      abolition novel published by Thayer &amp; Eldridge in 1860. Ellen "Nelly"
      O'Connor, William O'Connor's wife, had a close personal relationship with
      Whitman. In 1872 Whitman would walk out on a debate with William Douglas
      O'Connor over the Fifteenth Ammendement, which Whitman opposed and O'Connor
      supported. Ellen O'Connor defended Whitman's opinion, and in response William
      O'Connor established a separate residence. The correspondence between Whitman
      and Ellen O'Connor is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with
      William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors see <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00948_n2">2. Probably George William
      Curtis (1824–1892), the editor of <em>Harper's Weekly</em>,
      who in 1865 proposed to William O'Connor that he write to George W. Carleton, a
      New York publisher, about the publication of <em>The Good Gray
         Poet</em>; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company, 1906–1996),
      1:86.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00948_n3">3. J. Hubley Ashton, the
      assistant Attorney General, actively interested himself in Whitman's affairs,
      and obtained a position for the poet in his office after the Harlan fracas. In
      December 1862, on his way to visit George at Fredericksburg, Virginia, Whitman
      stopped in Washington and encountered Charles W. Eldridge, who was now a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster. After he had seen for himself that George
      had not been severely wounded, he returned to Washington, which was to be his
      home until 1873. Eldridge obtained a desk for Whitman in the office of Major
      Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00948_n4">4. Matthew F. Pleasants, who
      later became chief clerk in the Attorney General's office.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00948_n5">5. Miss Howard and her
      sister, probably Miss Garaphelia Howard, one of Whitman's Washington friends. In
      a February 11, 1874 letter to Ellen O'Connor, Whitman describes Garaphelia
      Howard as "a good, tender girl—true as steel."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
