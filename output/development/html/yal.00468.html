   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00468_n1">1. This draft letter appears
      in a notebook at Yale with the following also in Whitman's hand: "Sir | Feeling
      that I am competent &amp; determined to give satisfaction I hereby apply for an
      appointment under you on the road | W H Duckett | May 6 '87." Undoubtedly
      Duckett, Whitman's young Camden driver, was expected to make a copy of the
      letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
