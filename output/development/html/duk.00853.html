   <p>Very hot to-day—now two weeks of it &amp; I am pulled down by it
      badly—feel it to-day worse than yet—have had a few mouthfuls of dinner,
      &amp; am sitting here in my big chair—after reading your letter &amp;

      little piece—a slip copy—a N Y newspaper syndicate (S S McClure, Tribune
      Building) vehemently solicited, &amp; gave me $25 (far more than it is
      worth)—Then I have sent a three line piece "Twilight" ($10) to the
      "Century"<sup><a href="#duk.00853_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> wh' they accepted &amp; paid
      for—Hartman<sup><a href="#duk.00853_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> has been in Phila ten days, but
      returns to B[oston]—what do you think of him &amp; of his projected

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="duk.00853_n1">2. O'Connor wrote on July 2
      to Dr. Bucke and Kennedy (Charles E. Feinberg Collection, the Library of
      Congress). Whitman received a (lost) card from Mrs. O'Connor on July 12
      (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0262">3. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <p id="n0862">4. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00853_n3">6. Carl Sadakichi Hartmann
      (1869–1944), son of a German father and a Japanese mother and author of
      books on religion, art, and poetry. On 
      Baxter informed Whitman of a "call" from "your friend Hartmann, who is on his
      way back to Philadelphia from Europe." Hartmann published in the New York <em>Herald</em> on April 14, 1889, "Walt Whitman. Notes of a
      Conversation with the Good Gray Poet by a German Poet and Traveller." Whitman
      expressed his disapproval of the article in his letter to William Sloane Kennedy
      of May 4, 1889. Hartmann also tried to establish a Walt Whitman Society in
      Boston. Whitman would later credit Kennedy and Sylvester Baxter with putting an
      end to Hartmann's Whitman Club at the poet's request (Horace Traubel, ed., <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.56.html">Saturday, September 8, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
