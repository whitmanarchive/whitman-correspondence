   <p>Pete, do you remember<sup><a href="#tex.00435_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—(of course you do—I do well)—those great long jovial walks we had at times for years,
      (1866–'72) out of Washington City—often moonlight nights—'way to "Good Hope";—or, Sundays,
      up and down the Potomac shores, one side or the other, sometimes ten miles at a stretch?
      Or when you work'd on the horse-cars, and I waited for you, coming home late together—or resting and
      chatting at the Market, corner 7th Street and the Avenue, and eating those nice musk
      or watermelons? Or during my tedious sickness and first paralysis ('73) how you used to come to my solitary garret-room and make up my bed, and enliven
      me, and chat for an hour or so—or perhaps go out and get the medicines Dr. Drinkard
      had order'd for me—before you went on duty?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, give my love to dear Mrs. and Mr. Nash,<sup><a href="#tex.00435_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and tell them I have not forgotten them, and never will.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00435_n1">1. This note is written on
      the fly-leaf of a copy of <em>Specimen Days</em>, sent to Peter
      Doyle at Washington, D.C., in June, 1883. It was published subsequently in <em>Specimen Days &amp; Collect</em> as "Note to a Friend" (see
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html"><em>Complete Prose Works</em></a>, 443). The note is
      significant, because it constitutes the first correspondence from Whitman to
      Doyle since July 1880. It appears that writing <em>Specimen
         Days</em> stirred Whitman's memories of the times he shared with Doyle in
      Washington, contributing to the nostalgic air of this note.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00435_n2">2. Mr. and Mrs. Michael
      Nash were old, mutual friends of Whitman and Peter Doyle in Washington. Whitman
      referred to them often, especially in closing, in his letters to Doyle.<a href="#r2">[back]
