      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have poems by Thos Moore, letters and poems by Bryant, Longfellow, Whittier, Sr.
      W. Scott, Thackery, Campbell, Montgomery [
      <span class="unclear">Rulmer Sytton?</span>]
      , [
      <span class="unclear">Rutyebue?</span>]
      , [
      <span class="unclear">Berenjer Samontine?</span>]
       and many, many more written and signed by their own hands, but I have nothing in
      the autograph of that author whose name is written Walt Whitman â€”Is it asking too
      much, if you are sufficiently recovered from illness, to request a few lines with
      your signature to be placed in such good company?
   </p>

       Truly
