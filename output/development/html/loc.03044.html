      <br></br>Washington, D.C.
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">June 3, 1882.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your two letters, full of memoranda, of May 28 and 30 came duly. I have "toiled
      terribly," as Cecil said of Raleigh, and sent off another letter to the Tribune,
      which I think will make Mr. Chadwick wear a toupee,  for I have snatched him
      bald-headed. It has cost me great labor, though you may not think so when you read
      it, it runs off so savagely easy; but the difficulty in a controversy of this kind
      is to mould everything so as not to lay yourself open, and to give no points to the
      enemy, and this costs  time and care. My old fencing-master, Boulet, (no better ever
      lived; he taught once at West Point,) taught me always to cover my breast with hilt
      and point, even in the lunge, and I think of his lessons when engaged in fence of
      another kind. I hope I have succeeded in being both guarded and bold  in this new
      encounter with Chadwick.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have freely used the memoranda you sent, and got in as much of it as I could see
      my
      way to employ, and as much as I dared. I think you will feel satisfied with the use
      I have made of it. Some things I thought it prudent to withhold, because 
      they might provoke replication when we are not
      in a position to defend ourselves, not being ever sure that a single organ is open
      to us.
   </p>
   
   <p>You must be very careful in this matter. Even <u>words</u> must be
      carefully chosen, for the enemy is unscrupulous and uses every advantage we give
      him. I came near getting into a pretty scrape by trusting to your memorandum about
      the appearance of Emerson's letter in Cooke's memoir published by Osgood. It was a
      splendid point to make, that the letter appeared  verbatim in a book issued with
      Emerson's own sanction a year ago, and I worked it in and made the most of it. But
      at the last, I thought it would be prudent to see the book, and there was the letter
      sure enough, but with a lot of remarks by the editor to the effect that "it is
      understood" (the usual sneaking lie in putting it) that Emerson had considerably
      modified his feeling, and regretted, etc., etc. Fortunately, there is not a word in
      the preface to show that the book had Emerson's sanction,—but just see the
      scrape I would have been in had I used the information in the shape you sent it!!
      
      Indeed, Walt, you ought to be more careful, "A
      wild and many-weaponed throng, hang on our front and flank and rear." If I had said
      that the letter was reprinted in a book with Emerson's sanction, Chadwick would have
      had me. Our stronghold is the Emerson letter, <u>unretracted by
         himself.</u>
      Next thing we
      shall have to meet, will be the stories of what Emerson <u>said</u> to this man or that man. We must deny them all, and call for proof.
      Let us admit nothing. Make the other side <u>prove</u> their
      allegations.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope my new letter will be as successful with you and the public  as my first. My
      aim has been to shut Chadwick up for good, for I don't want to be bothered on a side
      issue by this egotistic jackass.
   </p>
   
   <p>Letters are pouring in upon me. One from John Hay, very cordial. One from the
      Melancholy Club of New York, very overflowing, inviting me to a grand supper to be
      given on Saturday (this) evening  in honor of <u>you</u> and of my letter! Have you been invited? And who are the Melancholy
      Club men, of Lexington Avenue? I returned them a civil letter of regret at my
      inability to be present, etc., and consoled them by offering as a toast "old
      Selden's trumpet-sentence—'Before all things, liberty!"—"words," I said
      "which are good 
      to remember when thought is menaced by law." I
      have had a number of other letters from persons unknown. One from Bucke, quite
      jubilant over my letter, and telling me the fix I have got his book into, which is
      comic as a scene from Moliere. You will see the fun when you know  that he had sent
      his <u>MS</u>. to Osgood!! I also got a letter from John
      Burroughs, announcing his arrival, and I at once sent him a <u>Tribune</u> containing the letter. I also have a letter from Dr. Channing at
      Providence, red-hot for you, and proposing to reprint my "Good Gray Poet" at his
      expense!!
   </p>
   
   <p>There has been quite a swarming of people after me. The press notices are generally
      favorable and hearty. I hope nothing adverse or disastrous will happen. I want the
      matter to result in your getting a publisher, as it ought.
   </p>
   
   <p>Watch the <u>Tribune</u> for my anti-Chadwick. I hardly think it
      will fail to bring him down. At the last moment, after two days of anxious
      cogitation, I cut out of it several pages of really withering ridicule, excellent in
      itself, but possibly injurious to the main effect. You see how solely I consider
      the interests of your cause—sacrificing thereto my choicest satirical
      felicities!
