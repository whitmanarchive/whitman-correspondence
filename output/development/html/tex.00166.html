      <br></br><br></br>My dear sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been much interested in a letter from you to Mr. Redpath,<sup><a href="#tex.00166_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> written some weeks ago, which I have lately seen, &amp; I am very glad to send you the
      inclosed check to be used for the benefit of our noble "boys" in the hospitals, at
      your discretion.  I have seen much of the hospitals myself, &amp; I know how much good
      your friendly sympathy must do them, &amp; also that even a slight pecuniary aid is sometimes
      very acceptable to them in their forlorn condition.
   </p>
   
   <p>Of the enclosed check, ten dollars of the amount is contributed by my sister, Mrs.
      G.W. Briggs of Salem,<sup><a href="#tex.00166_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> to whom I read your letter, &amp; ten dollars by my friend Edward Atkinson.<sup><a href="#tex.00166_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>  The balance I give to the boys with great pleasure, &amp; I will very gladly give more
      hereafter, when I hear from you of the receipt of this &amp; find that more is needed.
   </p>
   
   <p>As your letter is not of a very late date, I do not feel certain that your address
      may be the same as at the time you wrote.  Please inform me how this is, as I hope
      to be able to send you more from other friends.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope you will continue in your good work, as I am sure from your letter, &amp; from
      what my friend, Mr. Emerson, says of his own acquaintance with you, that your visits
      must give great comfort to our poor suffering men.
   </p>

      I am, with much regard,
      <br></br>Very Truly Yours,

   <p id="tex.00166_n2">1.  James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> (New York: Rowman and Littlefield, 1961), 3:459–461. He
      concluded his first letter to Whitman on June 25, 1860: "I love you, Walt! A
      conquering Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric yawp"
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection; Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em> [1961], 3:460). See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath</em> (New York: Barse and Hopkins, 1926).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="tex.00166_n3">2. Lucia Jane Russell Briggs,
      the wife of the pastor of the First Parish Church in Salem, Massachusetts, heard
      of Whitman's work in the Washington hospitals through her brother, Dr. LeBaron
      Russell; see Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1961–77),
      1:188. In her letter of , Mrs Briggs
      wrote: "I inclose seventy-five dollars, which I have collected among a few
      friends in Salem, and which I hope may be of some little service to our brave
      boys, who surely should not suffer while we have the power to help them. You
      have our warmest sympathy in your generous work, and though sad to witness so
      much suffering, it is indeed a privilege to be able to do something to alleviate
      it."

      ardent Free-Soil advocate and eventually raised money for John Brown. By 1863,
      he was actively participating in the "Cotton Question" by determining how the

      post-slavery economy.<a href="#r3">[back]
