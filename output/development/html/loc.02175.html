      <br></br><br></br>My dear old Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have been a good deal worried of late. My Publisher—T. Fisher Unwin prepared a
      contract which does not satisfy lawyers and business men—nor me either when
      they explained it.<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Hence delays, insolent
      letters—in short, matters came to such a pass that I have placed the <u>un</u>signed
      draft entirely in the hands of Mr. Ross,—Honorary Secretary of the Incorporated
      Society of Authors.<sup><a href="#loc.02175_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> A first rate fellow, who
      understands 
      Publishers &amp; their agreements, perhaps as well as any man in England.
   </p>
   
   <p>The upshot of it all will be that either Unwin will sign my agreement as drawn by
      Ross <u>or</u> I shall part company with my gentleman.
   </p>
   
   <p>The bone of contention is over the change of form: the publisher wishes to reserve
      to
      himself the exclusive right of altering the form &amp; price of editions with out
      taking heed of author's wishes. Though Unwin owns that it is a good book, and that
      the author is getting
      very little for it; yet he has the cheek to stand out for this cool
      proposition—and my advisers (amongst them is one of the ablest lawyers in
      London) says that  this won't do. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I am vexed that the final circular is not to hand. I corrected the final revise (the
      list of names etc:) months ago and posted back to Fraser—the printer. 
   </p>
   
   <p>John Fraser<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> (a friend of yours) as I think as I mentioned to you in a previous
      letter, is doing this for love and not money; therefore I have not been able to
      hurry him. However I wrote about it a few days ago, asking for some explanation as
      to such delay. As you know he would not hear of taking any money from me for the
      first circular relating to free-will-offering—  though a journey man printer, I
      take it or foreman? I don't clearly know his exact position Cope's Tobacco Factory
      at Liverpool.
   </p>  
   
   <p>Your last letter to William M. Rossetti<sup><a href="#n0522" id="r4">4</a></sup> is to be facsimiled as before. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Grace<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r5">5</a></sup> is staying at Marley with a friend in Surrey. I expect her back on Monday. 
   </p>
   
   <p>I am alone, very much alone and every day I miss my mother more than the last—I
      only keep things right by incessant work. 
   </p>
   
   <p>It will be the spring before I shall be able to get away—the early
      spring—when if feasible
      I shall come over to America for a few months: I think that it will do me a world
      of
      good.

   <p id="n0522">4. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0890">5. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00940_n2">7. Count Adam Gurowski
      (1805–1866), a Polish exile, published an eccentric three-volume Diary
      (1862–1866), a day-by-day account of the war written with a marked
      partiality toward extreme abolitionists. The Count was a colorful figure: he
      covered his lost eye with a "green blinder," and "he had a Roman head...a
      powerful topknot, in and out: people always stopped to look at him" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New York, Rowman
      and Littlefield, 1961], 3:79, 96). William D. O'Connor, who apparently
      translated Gurowski's manuscripts into English (see the letter from Gurowski to
      O'Connor in Feinberg), reported to Whitman on , that "he is a madman with lucid intervals"—he had
      attempted "to discipline the firemen with a
      pistol."
      Whitman maintained to Traubel in 1888 that "he was truly a remarkable, almost
      phenomenal, man," and that "he was, no doubt, very crazy, but also very sane"
      (3:79, 340). Ellen O'Connor related in a letter on , that the Count had said to her recently: "My Gott,
      I did not know that [Walt Whitman] was such a poet, tell him so, I have been
      trying every where to find him to tell him myself." In the last volume of the
      Diary, Gurowski placed Whitman's name in the first category of his threefold
      evaluation of persons "mentioned in this volume": "Praise," "Half and Half," and
      "Blame." In his entry for April 18, 1864, the Count referred to Whitman as among
      "the most original and genuine American hearts and minds" (187). In a footnote
      (372–373), appended September 12, 1865, Gurowski abused Harlan, who had
      "shown himself to be animated by a spirit of narrow-minded persecution that
      would honor the most fierce Spanish or Roman inquisitor." Gurowski was praised
      by Robert Penn Warren, in Malcolm Cowley, ed., <em>Writers at
         Work: The "Paris Review" Interviews</em>, (New York: Viking, 1958), 189. See
      also LeRoy Fischer, <em>Mississippi Valley Historical Review</em>,
      36 (1949–1950): 415–434, and the <em>Dictionary of
         American Biography, Supplement One</em> (New York: Scribner, 1944).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02175_n3">8. Gilchrist is referring to
      Mrs. Eames. Charles Eames was a prominent maritime attorney in Washington, D.C.,
      in the 1860s, and his wife was a legendary hostess, who turned their home into a
      social center for political and cultural figures. Mrs. Eames remained loyal to
      the controversial Count Gurowski after he had been discredited by many people,
      and she nursed him at the Eames home during his ultimately losing battle with
      typhoid fever. Julia Ward Howe writes about Mr. and Mrs. Eames and their
      relationship with Gurowski in her <em>Reminiscences,
         1819–1867</em>.<a href="#r8">[back]
