   <p>I have had such joy this morning, my Darling—Poems of yours given in the "Daily
      News" sublime Poems (one of them reaching dizzy heights) filling my soul with strong
      delight. These prefaced by a few words timid enough yet kindly in tone, &amp; better
      than nothing.—The days the weeks are slipping by my Beloved, bearing me
      swiftly surely to you—before the beauty of the year begins to fade we shall
      come. The young folk too are full of bright anticipation &amp; eagerness now, I am
      thankful to say; and Percy getting  on with I trust such
      near &amp; definite prospect of his happiness that he will be able to pull along
      cheerily towards it after we are gone in spite of loneliness.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I expect Darling we must go to some little town or village ten or twenty miles short
      of Philadelphia till the tremendous influx of visitors to the Centennial has ceased, else we shall not be able to find a
      corner there.—By the bye I feel a little sulky at your always taking a fling
      at the poor Piano. I see  I have got to try &amp; show you it too is capable of waking deep chords in the
      human soul when it is the vehicle of a great Master's thought &amp;
      emotions—if only my poor fingers prove equal to the task! All my heart shall
      go into them—Take from my picture a long long look of tender love and joy and
      faith, deathless ever young, ever growing, ever learning aspiring love, tender
      cherishing, domestic love. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Oh may I be full of 
      sweet comfort for my Beloved's Soul and Body through life, through and after death.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
