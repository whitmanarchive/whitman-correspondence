      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a dismal winter snow storm outside, and as I write I am sitting here by a good
      wood
      fire in the stove—have been alone all the evening—I sit up as much as I can,
      especially evenings—as I sleep better afterwards—I rec'd a letter from Jeff<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      to–day,<sup><a href="#yal.00411_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Matty<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r3">3</a></sup> was as well as at last
      accounts—about the same—no worse—I also rec'd a letter from Heyde<sup><a href="#yal.00411_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—he said Han<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r5">5</a></sup> was well as
      usual—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been sitting up nearly all day—&amp; have less distress in the head than I
      have had—which is a great gain—I had a letter from Mrs. Price<sup><a href="#n0483" id="r6">6</a></sup> to–day—she invites me to come &amp; stop awhile there, as soon as I can
      journey—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, it is kind of <em>company</em> to write to you—it is very
      lonesome to sit here all the evening in my room—about 9 Charles Eldridge<sup><a href="#n0210" id="r7">7</a></sup> comes in &amp; assists me to soak my feet in hot water, &amp; then I turn
      in—(I have my 
      trowsers
      
       on this evening, first time in 3 weeks)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Friday noon Feb. 14 </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I am sitting up again to–day—passed a comfortable night, &amp; as soon
      as it is favorable weather I shall try to get <em>started</em> for
      outside—first, to get down stairs—&amp; then perhaps across the
      street—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>3 o'clock </p>
   
   
   <p>I have just got a letter from Jeff, which I enclose as it is the latest—Mrs.
      O'Connor<sup><a href="#n0450" id="r8">8</a></sup> has just been to see me—brought a basket of nice
      things—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, I hope you will have a pleasant Sunday—I send you Harper's<sup><a href="#n0290" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; Frank Leslie's<sup><a href="#n0246" id="r10">10</a></sup>—I am having a very fair
      day to–day—it is moderate &amp; pleasant here, but mostly cloudy—I have
      been quite occupied writing several letters about business<sup><a href="#yal.00411_n3" id="r11">11</a></sup>—have set up all day, with the exception of an hour—Love to you, dear mother, 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0710">1. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00411_n1">2. Jeff wrote on February 11, 1873, both  and to his mother (Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). Jeff still hoped, since he did not appreciate the
      gravity of Walt Whitman's illness, that his brother would be able to visit
      Martha.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0707">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00411_n2">4. Heyde's letter to Walt Whitman is not
      extant, but on February 6, 1873, he wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman most
      solicitously about Walt's illness (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0285">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),
      a French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans
      for his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. Hannah and Charles Heyde
      lived in Burlington, Vermont. For more, see Paula K. Garrett, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_90.html">Whitman (Heyde), Hannah Louisa (d. 1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0483">6. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in
      various social-reform movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle
      factory in Brooklyn, and the couple had four children — Arthur, Helen,
      Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852, at 2 years of age). During the 1860s, Price
      and her family, especially her daughter, Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman
      and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In 1860 the Price family began to
      save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard
      Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia:
      David McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters
      to her mother in <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 (1908):
      163–169. In a letter to Ellen M. O'Connor on , Whitman declared, "<em>they are all
         friends</em>, to prize and love deeply." Gay Wilson Allen notes that Edmund
      Price owned a pickle factory on Front street, where the Whitmans had resided,
      and he speculates that Whitman became acquainted with Abby through her speaking
      and writing for reform movements. See Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer,</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955), 199.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0210">7. Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0450">8. For a time Walt Whitman lived with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to
      be his close associates during the early Washington years. William Douglas
      O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good
      Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. In 1872 Whitman
      and William strongly disagreed on the Fifteenth Amendment, which Whitman opposed
      and O'Connor supported. Ellen defended Whitman's opinion, and in response
      William moved out. The correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost
      as voluminous as the poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with the O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0290">9. <em>Harper's Monthly Magazine</em>
      (sometimes <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> or simply <em>Harper's</em>) was established in 1850 by Henry J. Raymond and
      Fletcher Harper. The magazine published several of Walt Whitman's poems,
      including "" and "." In 1857, Fletcher Harper founded <em>Harper's Weekly</em> (subtitled "A Journal of Civilization"),
      which gained its fame for its coverage of the Civil War and its publication of
      cartoonist Thomas Nast's (1840–1902) work. For Whitman's relationship with
      these two publications, see "" and "."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0246">10. <em>Frank Leslie's Weekly</em>,
      published from 1852 to 1922, was an American literary and news magazine
      published by engraver Frank Leslie (1821–1880). The magazine was notably
      patriotic in its reporting, particularly on military conflicts like the Civil
      War and the First World War.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00411_n3">11. These letters are not known; probably Walt
      Whitman wrote to some of the dealers who handled his books.<a href="#r11">[back]
