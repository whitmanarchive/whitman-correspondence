      <br></br><br></br>Dear William,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My hand has been pretty bad, but looks more encouraging to-day. I don't think there
      is anything very serious, but it has caused me much suffering, since I have been
      here. If the "Radical" has come, send me a copy immediately.<sup><a href="#nyp.00292_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> Address to No 101 Portland avenue,
      opposite Arsenal. Mother is well as usual. We both send love to you and Nellie. I
      expect to be back next Monday.
   </p>

      Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman" appeared in the May
      issue of the <em>Boston Radical</em>, 7 (1870), 345–359,
      reprinted in <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em> (1893), ed. Horace L.
      Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned, 41–55, and <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed.
      Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1918],
      3–22. In an undated letter, probably written early in June 1870,
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman commented: "that Lady seems to understand your
      writing better than ever any one did before as if she could see right
      through you. she must be a highly educated woman" (The Trent Collection of
      Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections
      Library). On , Charles Heyde
      wrote of the article: "Yet you 
      percieve
      
      , even the praise she bestows [i?]s qualified with the general
      recoil, which all natures of true human sensibility experience, at your
      (mistaken) barbarism. The louse and the maggot know as much about
      procreation as you do, and when you unveil and denude yourself, you descend
      to the level of the dog, with the bitch, merely."<br><br>
      Since O'Connor promised William Michael Rossetti to have Mrs. Gilchrist's
      essay "fitly given to the world" (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em> [New York:
      Scribner &amp; Welford, 1887], 187), he probably arranged for its
      publication in the <em>Radical</em>, which was printed in
      Boston by Samuel H. Morse, and which included among its contributors at
      least two of Walt Whitman's friends, Conway and Alcott; see Frank Luther
      Mott, <em>History of American Magazines</em> (Cambridge:
      Harvard University Press, 1957), 3:78. The former co-editor of the journal,
      Joseph B. Marvin, was now a clerk in the Treasury Department and was
      acquainted with Walt Whitman; Marvin is mentioned in Whitman's  letter to John
      Burroughs.<a href="#r2">[back]
