      getting  This makes the second Letter that I have wrote to you but as I expect the
      other one did not reach you I will try, try again, or maybe you have bin sick or have
      not had time to write, but I hope that you are not sick for you could not have as
      good attendance thear as if you wer at home and I do not know what the boys about the Hospital would do for they would
      miss you verry much.
   </p>
   
   <p>I got a letter from Tom. Sawyer<sup><a href="#tex.00127_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> on Saturday he is well and sens his love to you. he has bin in that Gettysburg Battle.
      he sais that it was awful, and that he never wants to see the like of it again
   </p>
   
   <p>My health is verry good, and my leg dos still continue's to mend slowly—but verry slow, the Doctor has took out three little pieces of bone out of it since I came
      home.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am enjoying my self as well as I can with my <em>four legs</em> but I cannot go about much yet I am a going out a carriage riding tomorrow if it
      dos not rain I do not know how I will stand it for it hurt me more riding from the
      Depot home than it did all the way in the cars.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will be back to the hospital about the last of August. I would like to be thear in time to see the boys present Doctor Bliss<sup><a href="#tex.00127_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> with that Case of instruments on the 23 of August, that will be my anaversary it will be just a year since I came to that hospital on that day so I think I will
      have to hurry back to see it. The farmers have got pretty near don Harvisting and the crops are pretty good without  it is grass and it is light and thear was so mutch wet weather that some of that was spoilt. No more at present but good by and write
      soon with my love to you and all enquiring friends, I remain your sincear friend Lewis K. Brown. Direct your letter to Lewis K. Brown Elkton, Cecil Country,
      (Md). paper is scarce so I will have to close good by and God bless you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Lewis Kirke Brown
      (1843–1926) was wounded in the left leg near Rappahannock Station on
      August 19, 1862, and lay where he fell for four days. Eventually he was
      transferred to Armory Square Hospital, where Whitman met him, probably in
      February 1863. In a diary in the Library of Congress, Whitman described Brown on
      February 19, 1863, as "a most affectionate fellow, very fond of having me come
      and sit by him." Because the wound did not heal, the leg was amputated on
      January 5, 1864. Whitman was present and described the operation in a diary
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #103). Brown was mustered out in August 1864, and was employed in the
      Provost General's office in September; see Whitman's . The
      following September he became a clerk in the Treasury Department, and was
      appointed Chief of the Paymaster's Division in 1880, a post which he held until
      his retirement in 1915. (This material draws upon a memorandum which was
      prepared by Brown's family and is now held in the Library of Congress.)
