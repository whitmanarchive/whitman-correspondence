      <br></br><br></br>Dear Tom
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still here &amp; am well as usual—have just returned from some twelve days
      down in the Jersey woods<sup><a href="#nyp.00428_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> where I like to go this time of
      year (I believe I have told you about it)—Plenty of woods here in Jersey &amp;
      plenty of sea-shore—&amp; I like them both—&amp; get a good deal of
      comfort out of them both—Things are going on pretty much the same with me as
      when I last wrote—that was an awful affair on the river, &amp; I tell you I
      looked over the lists of names the next two or three days with fear &amp;
      trembling—I 
      dont
      
       seem to remember Wm Hardy you mention—but I dare say I knew him
      among the men, poor fellow—
   </p>
   
   <p>It is now late Sunday afternoon, been a very hot day here, &amp; there is just now a
      lively little thunderstorm coming on, (&amp; over almost as soon as on)—I must
      finish my letter quickly, for I must go the P.O. here as it shuts at 6
      Sundays—Tommy, dear boy, this is only an apology for a letter but it will show
      that I bear you in mind &amp; all the rest too—I shall be on there at the
      Asylum this summer—not perhaps for a long visit, but for two or three
      weeks<sup><a href="#nyp.00428_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am having some work to do this summer
      at writing—I rec'd the
      paper—good luck to you if you run on the 28th—Tom, I must end—love
      to you &amp; the same to all the boys—&amp; girls too—
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00428_n1">1. Whitman was at the
      Staffords' only from June 11 to 15 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.). He spent twelve days in Glendale in May.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00428_n2">2. Whitman was too occupied
      with printing the Osgood edition to make the trip, but he met Nicholson and Dr.
      Richard Maurice Bucke in Jersey City, N.J., on July 23 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
