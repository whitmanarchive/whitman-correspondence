   </p>
   
   <p>Frank and I read your "Old Age's Lambent Peaks"<sup><a href="#loc.07660_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> yesterday afternoon as we sat
      together by the sea and he thought and spoke much of you as he often do.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear Friend—I wish that you could be with us to enjoy  on these, to me, beautiful <u>grey</u> afternoons when there is no glare from the sun, <u>few</u> people, so that one may be almost alone on the quiet
      beach and have only one's thoughts and the sounding sea.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think you will be interested to know that my cousin, of whom I have made mention
      to
      you as being intimate with the Lewes household;<sup><a href="#n4179" id="r2">2</a></sup> has  just returned from England where he
      has talked much of you. He is one of Frank's converts to the Whitman side and is now
      most enthusiastic and fairly raves about you.
   </p>
   
   <p>When is the new book to be out I hope it will be a great success! You will be sorry,
      I am sure, to hear that Churchill<sup><a href="#n4178" id="r3">3</a></sup> has had Typhoid Fever he is
      quite recovered however by this time and is growing very stout. I dont suppose his
       Father ever
      told you, how very well he did in College last winter. He took the "English prize"
      and
      in athletics he did remarkably well, being the <u>sixth</u>
      strongest man ever examined in the University. I hope no one but yourself will see
      this letter as I am sure it would bore anyone else to read it but knowing your love
      for Churchill I have not hesitated to
      "[
      <span class="unclear">bra?</span>]
      g" a little. With love from the boys
      and hoping you may scrawl a line just to prove you have not forgotten 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Bartholomew Houston Williams
      (1844–1920) was the wife of playwright and poet Francis ("Frank") Howard
      Williams (1844–1922) of Germantown, Philadelphia. The couple had a wide
      circle of literary acquaintances. Francis Howard Williams wrote a number of
      essays about Whitman, and Whitman often visited the Williams family and once was
      photographed with them. Whitman mentions them frequently to Horace Traubel,
      recalling "how splendidly the Williamses have always received me in their home"
      (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.66.html">Tuesday, September 18, 1888</a>).

      of Whitman and his work. Lewes had a son, Charles, who became a London city
