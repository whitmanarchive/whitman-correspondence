      <br></br><br></br>Dear son
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The money came all right, &amp; I will keep it for the present, &amp; use it for myself,—<u>but only to return it 
         at some future time, when I am</u> flush. Nothing very new with me. I still feel pretty well, for me, (&amp; 
      considering the past four years.) Who knows? May be after this winter, I shall feel
      well enough to come 
      on to Washington &amp; make out several weeks—&amp; we'll have a good time together, my loving
      son—(no more 
      long <u>walks</u>, to be sure—but we can be happy other ways)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Beautiful, mild, sunny, thawing afternoon to-day &amp; I have been out a little—down
      to see a poor 
      young man, an oysterman, Jim Davis, very low with consumption, took him some stew'd chicken for 
      his  dinner—then went to a nice reading room &amp; library we have here, very handy—then home
      to my 
      own dinner stew'd chicken &amp; nice roast potatoes—&amp; now (2½) up stairs in my room writing this, 
      &amp; feeling very fair—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>O Pete, you get that arm chair (with the broken arm) I left at Mrs Nash's,<sup><a href="#duk.00672_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—perhaps the broken arm 
      is still there, if so get it put on—then take the chair home for you as a new year's
      present, 
      &amp; for your mother to sit in, &amp; you afterwards—you know I used the chair for a year,
      &amp; if I 
      recollect right, it is a good strong one, though plain—I am glad to hear what you
      wrote about 
      your mother—Every thing about fellows' old mothers is interesting to me—
   </p>
   <p>—Give my love to Mr &amp; Mrs Nash—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
