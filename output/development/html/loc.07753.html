   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07753_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. |
      Feb 3 | 8 PM | 90.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07753_n2">2. On February 3 he sent
      "The Commonplace" and "The Human Voice" (prose) as well as a paragraph "ab't
      common school teachers" to <em>Munyon's Illustrated
         World</em>—"$20 due me." The poem appeared in that magazine in manuscript
      facsimile in March, 1891, and "The Human Voice" (later entitled "The Perfect
      Human Voice") in October, 1890; see William Sloane Kennedy, <em>The Fight of a Book for the World</em> (1926), 271. "Unknown Names" became
      "A Twilight Song" when it was accepted on February 26 by <em>Century</em>, which printed it in May and paid Walt Whitman $25 (<em>The Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">3. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07753_n3">4. "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf250r1">A Death-Bouquet</a>" became the last section of <em>Good-Bye My Fancy</em>, which was later reprinted in <em>Complete Prose Works</em> (1892). Though Whitman notes its appearance in
      the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in this letter, Floyd Stovall
      claims not to have found it there in his edition of the <em>Prose
         Works 1892</em>. See <em>The Collected Writings of Walt
         Whitman: Rpose Works 1892. Volume II, Collect and Other Prose</em>, ed.
      Floyd Stovall (New York: New York University Press, 1964), 671n.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07753_n4">5. See Whitman's  letter to Bucke, where the poet
      informs his correspondent that he has sent out a "welcome sonnet to
      Brazil."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07753_n5">6. Jacques Reich (1852-1923)
      sent "proofs of my drawings" on . This
      dated drawing is the frontispiece of Volume 5 of <em>The
         Correspondence of Walt Whitman</em>. Reich's etching, based upon Eakin's
      photograph, appears as the frontispiece to Volume I of <em>The
         Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> (1902), 10 vols..<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">7. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">8. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
