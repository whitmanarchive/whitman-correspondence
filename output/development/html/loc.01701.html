      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend<sup xmlns=""><a href="#loc.01701_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your long waited for letter brought me both joy &amp; pain; but the pain was not of
      your giving. I gather from it that a long letter which I wrote you Sept. 6th<sup><a href="#loc.01701_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> after I had received the precious packet, a letter in
      which I opened all my heart to you, never reached your hands: nor yet a shorter one
      which, tortured by anxiety &amp; suspense about its predecessor, I wrote Oct.
      15,<sup><a href="#loc.01701_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> it, too, written out of such stress &amp;
      intensity of painful emotion as wrenches from us inmost truth: I cannot face the
      thought of these words of uttermost trust &amp; love having fallen into other hands.
      Can both be simply lost? Could any man suffer a base curiosity, to make him so
      meanly treacherously cruel? It seems to cut and then burn me. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was not disappointed at the shortness of your letter &amp; I do not ask nor even
      wish you to write save when you are inwardly impelled &amp; desirous of doing so. I
      only want leave and security to write freely to you. Your book does indeed say
      all—book that is not a book but, for the first time, a man complete, godlike,
      august, standing revealed the only way possible, through the garment of speech. Do
      you know, dear Friend, what it means for a woman, what it means for me to understand
      these poems. It means for her whole nature to be then first kindled; quickened into
      life through such love, such sympathy, such resistless attraction, that thenceforth
      she cannot choose but live &amp; die striving to become worthy to share this divine
      mans life—to be his dear companion, closer, nearer, dearer than any man can be—for
      ever so. Her soul stakes all on this. It is the meaning, the fulfilment, the only
      perfect 
      developement
      
       &amp; consummation of her nature—of her passionate, high, immortal
      aspirations—her Soul to mate with his for ever &amp; ever. O I know the terms are
      obdurate—I know hard to attain to this greatness, the grandest lot ever aspired to
      by woman. I know too my own shortcomings, faults, flaws. You might not be able to
      give me your great love yet—to take me to your breast with joy. But I can wait. I
      can grow great &amp; beautiful through sorrow &amp; suffering, working, struggling,
      yearning, loving so, all alone, as I have done now nearly three years—it will be
      three in May since I first read the book, first knew what the word love meant. Love
      &amp; Hope are so strong in me, my souls high aspirations are of such tenacious,
      passionate intensity, are so conscious of their own deathless reality, that what
      would starve them out of any other woman only makes them strike out deeper roots,
      grow more resolute &amp; sturdy in me. I know that "greatness will not ripen for me
      like a pear." But I could face, I could joyfully accept the fiercest anguish, the
      hardest toil, the longest, sternest probation, to make me fit to be your mate—so
      that at the last you should say "this is the woman I have waited for, the woman
      prepared for me: this is my dear eternal comrade, wife—the one I so much want." Life
      has no other meaning for me than that—all things have led up to help prepare me for
      that. Death is more welcome to me than life if it means that—if then, dear Sailor,
      thou sailing upon thy endless cruise, thou takest me on board—me, daring all with
      thee, steering for the deep waters, bound where mariner has not yet dared to go:
      hand in hand with thee, nestled close—one with thee. Ah that word enough<sup><a href="#loc.01701_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> was like a blow on the breast to me—breast that often
      &amp; often is so full of yearning tenderness I know not how to draw my breath. The
      tie between us would not grow less but more beautiful, dear friend, if you knew me
      better: if I could stand as real &amp; near to you as you do to me. But I cannot
      like you clothe my nature in divine poems &amp; so make it visible to you. Ah
      foolish me! I thought you would catch a glimpse of it in those words I wrote—I
      thought you would say to yourself "perhaps this is the voice of my mate" &amp; would
      seek me a little to make sure if it were so or not. O the sweet dreams I have fed
      on
      these three years nearly, pervading my waking moments, influencing every thought
      &amp; action. I was so sure, so sure if I waited silently, patiently, you would send
      me some sign: so full of joyful hope I could not doubt nor fear. When I lay dying
      as
      it seemed, still full of the radiant certainty that you would seek me, would not
      lose [me], that we should as surely find one another there as here. And when the ebb
      ceased &amp; life began to flow back into me, O never doubting but it was for
      you—never doubting but that the sweetest, noblest, closest, tenderest companionship
      ever yet tasted by man &amp; woman was to begin for us here &amp; now. Then came the
      long long waiting, the hope deferred: each morning so sure the book would come &amp;
      with it a word from you that should give me leave to speak: no longer to shut down
      in stern silence the love, the yearning, the thoughts that seemed to strain &amp;
      crush my heart. I know what that means—"if thou wast not gifted to sing thou wouldst
      surely die." I felt as if my silence must kill me sometimes. Then when the Book came
      but with it no word for me alone, there was such a storm in [my] heart I could not
      for weeks read in it. I wrote that long letter<sup><a href="#loc.01701_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> out in
      the Autumn fields for dear life's sake. I knew I might and must speak then. Then I
      felt relieved, joyful, buoyant once more. Then again months of heart-wearying
      disappointment as I looked in vain for a letter—O the anguish at times, the scalding
      tears, the feeling within as if my heart were crushed &amp; doubled up—yet always
      afterwards saying to myself "if this suffering is to make my love which was born
      &amp; grew up &amp; blossomed all in a moment strike deep root down in the dark
      &amp; cold, penetrate with painful intensity every fibre of my being, make it a love
      such as he himself is capable of giving, then welcome this anguish, these bitter
      deferments: let its roots be watered as long as God pleases with my tears."<sup><a href="#loc.01701_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
