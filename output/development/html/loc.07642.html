   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:

   <p id="n4146">3. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

      was the Republican nominee for U.S. President in 1884, losing to Grover
      Cleveland; he was the presumptive nominee again in 1888 but refused to run,
      instead supporting eventual nominee Benjamin Harrison.<a href="#r5">[back]

      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="loc.07642_n6">7. "Sands at Seventy" is a
      group of poems Whitman first published in <em>November
         Boughs</em>, then added as an "annex" to <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07454_n2">8. Whitman was working on his
      book <em>November Boughs</em> at this time, and it was published
      in October 1888 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay. For more information on
      the book, see James E. Barcus Jr., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_39.html">November Boughs [1888]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="n4267">9. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.07642_n4">10. In the holograph, "no" is
      written above the word "weak." Whitman probably forgot to cross out the word
      "weak."<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4274">11. Timothy Blair Pardee
      (1830–1889) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, member of the
      Legislative Assembly of the Province of Ontaria, Canada, and Minister of the
      Crown. Pardee appointed Richard Maurice Bucke, with whom he was a close friend,
      as the Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane in Hamilton at its founding
      in 1876, and then the next year as Superintendent of the Asylum for the Insane
      in London. For more on Pardee, see H. V. Nelles, "Pardee, Timothy Blair," <em>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</em> Vol. 11 (Toronto:
      University of Toronto Press, 1982).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07642_n5">12. On  Bucke mentioned Pardee's illness. In
      the same letter he discussed a circular to raise funds for Whitman: "I have
      found time to write the circular and give it to the printer. I will send you a
      proof early in the week—but mind you are not supposed to see it however
      you may as well and perhaps you would suggest a verbal change or two—if
      you feel like it do so." Whitman was incensed—"hot" is Traubel's word: "I
      don't approve of it—I don't want money—I have enough for all I
      need!" (see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.82.html">Monday, June 18, 1888</a>). Whitman's friends, however, raised money
      without consulting him (see the second footnote in Whitman's , letter to William Douglas
      O'Connor).<a href="#r12">[back]
