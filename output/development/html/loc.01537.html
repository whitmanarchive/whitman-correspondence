      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is pretty much the same with me, as when I wrote my former letters—still
      home here with my mother, not busy at any thing particular but taking a good deal of
      comfort—It has been very hot here, but one stands it better here than in
      Washington, on account perhaps of the sea-air—I am still feeling well, &amp;
      am out around every day.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There was quite a brush in N. Y. on Wednesday<sup><a href="#loc.01537_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—the Irish lower orders (Catholic) had determined that the Orange
      parade (protestant) should be put down—mob fired &amp; threw
      stones—military fired on mob—bet. 30 and 40 killed, over a hundred
      wounded—but you have seen all about it in papers—it was all up in a
      distant part of the city, 3 miles from Wall street—five-sixths of the city
      went on with its business just the same as any other day—I saw a big squad of
      prisoners carried along under guard—they reminded me of the squads of rebel
      prisoners brought in Washington, six years ago—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The N. Y. police looked &amp; behaved splendidly—no fuss, few words, but <em>action</em>—great, brown, bearded, able, American looking
      fellows, (Irish stock, though, many of them)—I had great pleasure in looking
      on them—something new, to me, it quite set me up to see such chaps, all dusty
      &amp; worn, looked like veterans—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, dear son, I rec'd your two letters, &amp; was glad to get them—</p>
   
   
   <p>Mother has been quite sick, &amp; I have been sort of nurse, as she is here alone,
      none of my sisters being home at present—she is much better this morning,
      under my doctoring—
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Pete, I see by your letters that every thing goes on right with you on the
      road—give my best regards to my friends among the drivers &amp;
      conductors—Dear son, I shall now soon be coming back, &amp; we will be
      together again, as my leave is up on the 22d<sup><a href="#loc.01537_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I
      am now going to take a bath &amp; dress myself to go over to New York. Love to you,
      my dearest boy, &amp; good bye for this time—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01537_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Peter Doyle | Conductor, | Office Wash. &amp; Geo. City RR. Co. | Washington, |
      D. C. It is postmarked: New York | Jul(?) | 14 | 1:30.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01537_n2">2. With the headline "War at
      Our Doors," the New York <em>World</em> reported: "The ides of
      March have come and gone. In spite of the efforts of the clergy, the municipal
      authorities, and all good citizens, New York has been disgraced by a street
      fight in 1871 over the merits of an Irish battle fought and won in 1690." The
      journal devoted two full pages (in an eight-page issue) to the incident, and
      announced that 45 had been killed and 105 wounded. Whitman also wrote of the
      incident in his  letter to William D.
      O'Connor.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01537_n3">3. Because of his mother's
      illness, Whitman had his leave extended, and returned to Washington on July 31;
      see Whitman's  and  letters to Doyle.<a href="#r3">[back]
