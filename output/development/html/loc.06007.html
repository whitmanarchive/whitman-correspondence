   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.06007_n1">1. This draft letter is
      written on the back of a draft letter from Whitman to Richard W. Colles of . According to Whitman's
      Commonplace Book (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of
      the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.), a letter was sent on November 18 to Chatto &amp; Windus, the English firm
      which had just printed the second edition of Rossetti's <em>Poems
         by Walt Whitman</em>. On December 13 Whitman received six copies of the new
      edition, and on December 19 he sent two copies of the 1876 edition (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, and see the letter from Whitman to Chatto &amp; Windus of ).<a href="#r1">[back]
