   <p>I am not feeling very well these days—the doctors have told me not to come inside
      the hospitals for the present—I send there by a friend every day, I send things &amp;
      aid to some cases I know, &amp; hear from there also, but I do not go myself at present—it
      is probable that the hospital poison has affected my system, &amp; I find it worse than
      I calculated—I have spells of faintness &amp; very bad feeling in my head, fullness &amp;
      pain—&amp; besides sore throat—my boarding place, 502 Pennsylvania av, is a miserable
      place, very bad air—But I shall feel better soon, I know—the doctors say it will pass over—they have long
      told me I was going in too strong—some days I think it has all gone &amp; I feel well
      again, but in a few hours I have a spell again—
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I have not heard any thing of the 51st—I sent George's letter to Han—I have
      written to George since—I shall write again to him in a day or two—if Mary comes home
      tell her I sent her my love—if I dont feel better before the end of this week or beginning of next, I may come home for
      a week or fortnight for a change—the rumor is very strong here that Grant is over
      the James river on south side—but it is not in the papers—we are having quite cool
      weather here—Mother, I want to see you &amp; Jeff so much—I have been working a little
      at copying, but have stopt it lately—
