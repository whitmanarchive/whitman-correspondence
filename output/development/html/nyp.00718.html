      <br></br><br></br>Dear W. O'C.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your kind good copious letter came to-day &amp; has been read &amp; reread. Nothing
      new in the monotony of my life—I have rec'd a good plaster bust<sup><a href="#nyp.00718_n6" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Elias
      Hicks<sup><a href="#n0301" id="r3">3</a></sup> (size inclined to colossal) wh' I have put open in the corner of my
      room—&amp; I think it does me good—perhaps <em>needful</em> almost to me—Elias at the latent base was <em>sentimental</em>-<em>religious</em> like an
      old Hebrew mystic—&amp; though I may have some thing of that kind 'way in the
      rear it is pretty far in the rear &amp; I guess I am mainly sensitive to the
      wonderfulness &amp; perhaps spirituality of things <em>in
         their physical</em> &amp; <em>concrete expressions</em>—&amp; have celebrated all that—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—My writing for the <em>Herald</em><sup><a href="#n4160" id="r4">4</a></sup> continues on—they
      have lately written to me to continue—they have paid me so far $165, wh' I
      call first rate—25 for the Whittier<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r5">5</a></sup> bit, also enclosed—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—The little slip enclosed, Lilt of Songs, I sent first (a week or ten days ago)
      to the <em>Cosmopolitan</em> NY<sup><a href="#nyp.00718_n2" id="r6">6</a></sup>—asking $12—it came back
      at once <em>rejected</em>—So I sent it to <em>Herald</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00718_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup>—The <em>Cosm.</em> man stopt
      here last fall &amp; urged me to send him something—but I think they now have
      new men—Yes I think Stedman<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r8">8</a></sup> inclined to be friendly &amp; receptive<sup><a href="#nyp.00718_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup>—(L of
      G. though has to fight ag't a most infernal environment there in New York)
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00718_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd May 16/88." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | 1015 O Street | Washington
      | DC. It is postmarked: Camden, N.J. | Apr | 18 | 10 PM | 1888 | 4; Washington,
      Rec'd. | Apr | 18 | 10 PM | 1888 | 4.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00718_n6">2. The bust of Hicks was
      sculpted by Sidney Morse (1832–1903), a self-taught sculptor as well as a
      Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to 1872, editor of <em>The
         Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden many times and made various busts
      of him.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0301">3. Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker from Long
      Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious Society of
      Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks had been a
      friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a supporter
      and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4160">4. Whitman contributed a series of
      poems and prose pieces to the <em>New York Herald</em> at the
      invitation of the editor, James Gordon Bennett, Jr. From December 1887 through
      August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems were published in the paper.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">5. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r5">[back]

      editor of <em>Cosmopolitan</em> from <a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00718_n5">7. This poem was published as
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00084.html">The Final Lilt of Songs</a>" in the <em>New York
         Herald</em> on April 16, 1888, after being rejected by the <em>Cosmopolitan</em>.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">8. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00718_n3">9. O'Connor noted, on , spending an evening with Stedman,
      who spoke of Whitman's poetry "with enthusiasm": "His face is Zion-ward, &amp;
      he will be a credit to the family yet" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.75.html">Friday, April 5, 1889</a>. To which Whitman responded, when Traubel read
      O'Connor's letter aloud: "Welcome! thrice welcome Edmund, to our bed and
      board!"<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">10. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald
      D. Kummings, ed. (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="nyp.00718_n4">11. This postscript is
      written at the top of the letter.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05536_n4">12. The English poet and
      critic Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) first came to America on a lecture tour
      in October, 1883, and remained until March, 1884. He "returned to England
      confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
      uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
      the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
      without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <em>Matthew
         Arnold</em> [Indianapolis, 1917], 46–49).<a href="#r12">[back]
