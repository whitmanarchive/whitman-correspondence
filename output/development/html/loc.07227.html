      —it must be mighty slow for you staying in one room all the
      time—I think they ought to fit up the two downstairs rooms for you and have
      you there—you could sit by the window and see out would be more in the
      world—do you not think you would like it better? it would be no trouble to
      make the change—just put all the furniture you needed in those two rooms and
      live in them day &amp; night—then why  not have a low easy 
      
      carraige
      
       
      call round for you occationally on good days and drive a mile or two? It
      would not be much but it would make a change—I would let the horse &amp; buggy
      go and arrange for the easy carriage (hire it) in their place—I wish I could
      better attend to such things—perhaps I will be after a while if the meter
      turns out as we expect— I wish you would show this letter to Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> and authorise him to move in the matters mentioned or at all
      events consult him on the points raised—yes, H. is first class, I do not know
      what we should have done without him—all well here.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
