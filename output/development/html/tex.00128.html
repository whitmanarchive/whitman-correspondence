   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William E. Vandemark, a
      private in Company I of the 120th New York Infantry, was wounded at the Battle
      of Chancellorsville on May 3, 1863. Whitman noted that Vandemark was placed in
      "bed 39-Ward B" at Armory Square Hospital, and Whitman may have written a letter
      to Vandemark's sister Sarah in Accord, New York (Edward F. Grier, ed., <em>Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York:
      New York University Press, 1984], 2:644). Vandemark returned home on furlough
      and was briefly transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps during the summer of
      1864 before returning to his regiment. He was killed on a skirmish line during
      the charge on Fort Davis at Petersburg, Virginia, on September 28, 1864.
