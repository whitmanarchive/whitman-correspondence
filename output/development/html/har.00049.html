   <p id="har.00049_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      T H Bartlett | sculptor | 394 Federal Street | Boston Mass:. It is postmarked:

   <p id="har.00049_n2">2. Bartlett
      (1835–1923), an instructor in modelling at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology, was characterized by William Vaughan Moody as "a magnificent old
      goat and man of God . . . passing hours with immortal phrases"; see Hermann
      Hagedorn, <em>Edwin Arlington Robinson</em> (New York: Macmillan,
      1938), 254. Bartlett evidently affected the Whitman pose with his open collar
      and flowing tie. On , Bartlett
      informed Whitman that "the cast of your hand I shall soon send to Paris to be
      cast in bronze." The plaster cast is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; a bronze cast is at Yale. Probably
      Whitman met Bartlett at Colonel Johnston's studio on September 1, 1878
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="har.00049_n3">3. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
