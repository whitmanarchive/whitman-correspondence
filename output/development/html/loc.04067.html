      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I 
      recived
      
       yours of fourth to day and was agreeable surprised to 
      here
      
       of your improved Health.<sup><a href="#n0822" id="r1">1</a></sup> I had almost come to the 
      conclugen
      
       that you had given me up for the lost <em>child</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       many a
      time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I have wondered what kind of a fellow you thought I was. I 
      dont
      
       suppose there
      Has a day past over my Head without me thinking of you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am also very glad to learn of Mrs. <em>Siter</em>s. I suppose she Has
      a Hard time of it. I 
      recived
      
       one letter from her and 
      Johnnys
      
       Wife they wrote me rather a lamentable
      letter. Poor Jo Adams 
      Im
      
       sorry he is a fine fellow tell him I send him my 
      pies
      
       regards and hope he will get well soon. Johnny Cahall I cant altogether
      place him did he visit to live in Camden &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I 
      guss
      
       so.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So they have got the dummies running on Market St. [(] I 
      here
      
       they reduced the wages to two dollars) The 
      perment
      
       Exhibition I suppose will create almost as big a time this summer as last.
      
      Im
      
       sorry times is so Hard in Philadelphia and so many 
      famlys
      
       are in distress. I am glad Mrs. Siter is going to Have a small 
      famley
      
       and perhaps John Pickens will assist her. I suppose 
      Goorge
      
       is pretty smart I cant help but think about poor old 
      Granmother
      
       Gouth.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well Walt my dear old friend you say you feel wicked enough at times 
      wich
      
       you consider a good sign [(]I hope it is) you say you have been traveling
      a good [de]al. I hope you will be home to get this any way I will direct to your old
      Headquarters.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well Walt I will 
      endevor
      
       to give you a 
      rugh
      
      
      
      scetch
      
       of my wanderings since I seen you. You know I could not content my self in 
      Phila.—I was in Hot
      water all the time &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       to come and see you before I left I Had not the 
      corage
      
       to do that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       so I 
      drawed
      
       my money from the Centennial went down to my sister's &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       she was not at home
      but Annie, Johnny's Wife was 
      thir
      
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I 
      tould
      
       her my intentions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       I was very sorry I did not see Mrs <em>Siter</em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       Went direct from 
      thir
      
       to the 
      Depo
      
       and in less than half an Hour I was behind the iron <em>Horse</em>
      
      stearing
      
      
      
      twards
      
         
      Sunsit
      
       came 
      strate
      
       through to St. <em>Louis</em>. Had a little row with some
      <em>Pickpockets</em> on the Road—
      staid
      
       in St. Louis three Weeks then came out to Pleasant   
      Rige
      
       
      whare
      
       I wrote you a letter but got no answer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       
      staided
      
      
      
      thir
      
       about one month then moved East about seven miles to Grays and I think I
      wrote you a letter from 
      thir
      
       but never received an answer (began to think you had gone back on me) 
      staid
      
      
      
      thir
      
       until the   
      twentyfourth
      
       March when I 
      Emegrated
      
       here to Effingham Co. <em>Ill.</em> And am farming on my own
      Hack) 
      Thir
      
       is two Hundred and sixty acres in the farm and the way I   
      spraind
      
       my 
      Rist
      
       was Plowing a 
      stumppy
      
      
      
      pece
      
       of Ground [(]I Have got about ten acres of corn planted about thirty acres
      plowed) this is a very Backward Spring 
      Hear
      
       as <em>you</em> say it is 
      thir. The times Here is pretty Hard 
      asposuly
      
       with me as I Have got all my 
      captal
      
       invested in starting Farming &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
       But if my crops prospers and the European War
      continues I will 
      com
      
       out all right and I guess make a big thing.

      mens
