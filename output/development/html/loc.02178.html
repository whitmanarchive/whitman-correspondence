   <p> You will be glad to hear that I am going to republish some of mothers essays;<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> giving some account of her beautiful life. May I quote
      from some of your letters to mother?<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> and will you help
      me to the extent of lending me, mother's letters to you? those that you have kept?
      I
      should be glad of them quite soon, as I have got to work already; at present
      thinking over her life is the only thing that I take pleasure in: indeed I am unable
      to get my thoughts away, and I don't want to. 
   </p>
   
   <p> It will help the book if you can insert the following paragraph  or something
      like it in the "Phila:
       Press" &amp; "Ledger"— 
   </p>
   
   <p> "A Memoir of the the Late Mrs Anne Gilchrist is being prepared by her family &amp;
      friends, we understand that the volume will contain a large amount of interesting
      correspondence exchanged with a varied circle of acquaintances and friends,

      Unwin will publish the work." 
   </p> 
   
   <p> I and Rossetti have inserted a final paragraph about "free-will-offering",<sup><a href="#loc.02186_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> giving the amount; as a final whip up to any laggard well wisher. 
      I have just received 10/ from the Honble: Roden Noel,<sup><a href="#loc.02178_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> who tells
       me that he
      is just republishing an article about you in volume form. I understand from Rossetti
      that since the last paragraph in Athenaeum;
      he has received several subscriptions. Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r10">10</a></sup> is fairly well and so is my brother

      consumption I fear, is Mrs Rossetti, but not much. I am getting back to my painting

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0139">4. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) was a Scottish
      writer who wrote frequently on the conflict between scientific changes and the
      traditional social (often religious) order. For Whitman's writings on Carlyle in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf087v1">Death of Thomas Carlyle</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf088v1">Carlyle from American Points of View</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3044">5. "George Eliot" was the pen name of
      Mary Ann Evans (1819–1880), one of the most influential British writers of
      the nineteenth century. Her works include <em>The Mill on the
         Floss</em> (1860), <em>Middlemarch</em> (1871–1872), and
      <em>Daniel Deronda</em> (1876). Whitman was especially
      enamored by Eliot's essay writing: "She is profound, masterful: her analysis is
      perfect: she chases her game without tremor to the very limit of its endurance"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.109.html">Wednesday, October 31, 1888</a>).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.02178_n4">6. George Henry Lewes
      (1817–1878) was an English critic and philosopher. He was the partner of
      George Eliot.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0522">7. William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="loc.02186_n1">8. See Whitman's letter of . Herbert Gilchrist and William
      Michael Rossetti had been collecting funds in England for the financial support
      of the aged poet. A paragraph in the <em>Athenaeum</em> of July
      11, 1885, read: "A subscription list is being formed in England with a view to
      presenting a free-will offering to the American poet Walt Whitman. The poet is
      in his sixty-seventh year, and has since his enforced retirement some years ago
      from official work in Washington, owing to an attack of paralysis, maintained
      himself precariously by the sale of his works in poetry and prose, and by
      occasional contributions to magazines." <a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02178_n3">9. The article in question,
      Roden Noel's (1834–1894) "A Study of Walt Whitman: The Poet of Modern
      Democracy" (<em>Dark Blue</em> 2 [October 1871], 241–253),
      spoke glowingly of Whitman, describing him as "tall, colossal, luxuriant,
      unpruned, like some giant tree in a primeval forest . . . He springs out of that
      vast American continent full-charged with all that is special and national in
      it" (242).<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="n0890">10. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2000">11. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist
      (1851–1935) was a British chemist and metallurgist, and the son of
      Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. Along with his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, he
      developed the Thomas-Gilchrist process of producing steel from phosphoric pig
      iron during the late 1870s. See Marion Walker Alcaro, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.:
      Associated University Presses, 1991), 252 n28.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0830">12. Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">13. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
