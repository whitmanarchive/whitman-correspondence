      <br></br><br></br>To Walt Whitman. Gentleman.
      <br></br>Sir.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You have had many tributes from the learned and great of Europe and America. Yet you
      will not despise that of a simple, honest woman who writes to thank you, in all
      sincerity for those "Leaves of Grass" from which her soul has drawn such health,
      freshness and aroma. I visited Washington for the first time, this May. The quest
      of
      Mrs. Schwartz, (who one night in passing off the platform of a
      Car, gave you a rose) I was compelled to many Car rides in my transit to "the City".
      On Car No 14, I encountered you more than once. Your face, which I chose to think
      a
      <u>facsimile</u> of the grand old patriarch's, Abraham,
      attracted me. Through Mr. Devlin, from Mr.
      Doyle, I was allowed to read your—I prefer saying—I was
      permitted a <u>long look</u> into that wonderful mirror of your
      creation, where I saw the reflex of <u>your</u>
       soul, and felt the
      influence of your divining power. Mr 
      O'Conner's
      
       manly, eloquent, but most unnecessary vindication of your purity was also given me.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p><span class="indent">"Only themselves understand themselves and the like of
         themselves.</span><br><span class="indent">As Souls only understand Souls."</span><br></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I needed no one to translate for me the language of yours, written so plainly in
      every line and furrow of your face, and revealed to the world in the many gracious
      deeds of love to your kind.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I closed your book revelation, a wiser and more thoughtful woman, than when, from
      idle curiosity I first opened it, at the very stanza, "Perfectious" which I have
      just quoted. Life held grander possibilities to me from that hour, and the mission
      of a soul, born into this world to love, influence, and suffer, was invested with
      profounder responsibilities.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To whoever is granted the power to make  another long for <u>Truth</u>, for its own beautiful sake; love the lowly and
      oppressed for the sake of the divinity spark which is in each human body, and see
      in
      Nature the heart of the great Mother–God who conceived and gave it
      birth.—To such an one there is a debt due of allegiance and profound
      gratitude.
   </p>
   
   <p>I thank you Sir, with all my heart, and pray for you the abiding Presence and hourly
      Comfort of the divine <u>Pure in Heart</u> whom you worship.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I need make no apology for this note. You will not misunderstand it. I go to my home
      in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, tomorrow. I may never again chance to see you, but you
      will believe, nevertheless that I will wish for you—and teach others to do the
      same—a long earth–life of usefulness, and an eternity of <u>appreciation</u> and reward.
   </p>
