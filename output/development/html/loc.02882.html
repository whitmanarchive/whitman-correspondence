      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Since last I wrote to you at the beginning of April (enclosing a little photograph
      of
      [
      <span class="unclear">the old</span>]
      
      avenue just by our cottage at Colne) I have been into Wales for a fortnight to see
      Percy &amp; have looked for the first time in my
      life, on the Atlantic—the ocean my mental eyes travel over &amp; beyond so
      often, and that your eyes and ears &amp; heart have been fed by, have communed with
      and interpreted, as in a new tongue to the soul of man. Looking upon that, watching
      the tides ebb &amp; flow, that ebb &amp; flow on your shores, sharing, through my
       beloved book, in
      those greatest moments you have spent alone with it—that was a new joyful
      experience, a fresh kind of communing with you.—I went to Wales because I felt
      anxious about Percy, who is not happy just now. I must not tell friends here about
      it (except his brother &amp; sisters but I am sure I may tell you, for you will
      listen with sympathy. [
      <span class="unclear">He
         has attached</span>]
       himself very [
      <span class="unclear">deeply, I think it will prove, to a</span>]
      
      girl, &amp; she to him whose parents [
      <span class="unclear">welcomed</span>]
       him cordially to their
      [
      <span class="unclear">house for</span>]
      
      a year or two &amp; allowed [
      <span class="unclear">plenty</span>]
       of intercourse till they became
      aware, through Percy himself who thought it right  to tell the father as soon as he was
      fully aware of his own feelings &amp; more than suspected Norah's response to them)
      that there was a strong affection growing up between the two. Then they peremptorily
      
      forbad
      
       all intercourse,—not because they have any objection to
      Percy—quite the contrary they say; but solely and simply because he is not yet
      earning money enough to marry on, &amp; they hold that a man has no right to engage
      a girl's affections till he can do so. As if these things could be timed to the
      moment the money comes in! Percy  was in hopes, &amp; so was I, that if I went down, I might get
      [
      <span class="unclear">sense</span>]
      
      enough into their heads, if not kindness &amp; sympathy into their hearts, to see
      that the sole effect of such arbitrary &amp; narrow sighted conduct would be to
      alienate &amp; embitter the young people's feelings toward them, while it would make
      them more restless &amp; anxious to marry without adequate means. Whereas if a
      reasonable amount of intercourse were allowed, it would be a happy time with them,
      &amp; Norah [
      <span class="unclear">being</span>]
       still so young, (18), &amp; Percy,—  working away with all
      his might, doing very well for his age &amp; sure, conscientious thorough capable
      &amp; well trained worker that he is (for the L. School of Mais gives a first rate
      scientific preparation for his profession) to be making a modest sufficiency in a
      year or two. Well, they were very courteous &amp; indeed friendly to me &amp; I
      think I have won [
      <span class="unclear">over</span>]
       the mother but the father remains obdurate, &amp; Percy feels
      bitterly the 
      separation—all the more trying as they live almost within sight of each other.
      So Beatrice &amp;
      Grace are going to spend their holidays with him this summer to cheer
      him up. Meanwhile, dear friend, I am on the whole happier than not about him. I
      liked what I saw of Norah &amp; believe he has found a very sweet affectionate girl
      of [
      <span class="unclear">quiet,
         domestic</span>]
       nature, practical— industrious
      sensible—thoroughly well to suit him, &amp; that there is true &amp; deep love
      between them—also she took to me very much &amp; I feel will be quite another
       child to me. It is
      besides no little joy to me to find how Percy has confided in me in this &amp;
      chooses me as the friend to whom he tells all— far from [
      <span class="unclear">being</span>]
       any separation
      as sometimes happens this love of his seems to draw us closer together. Only I am
      very, very anxious for his sake to see him in a better berth— they would let
      her marry him on £300 a year; now he has only £175. He is quite competent
      to manage iron or copper or tin works, only he looks so young, not having yet any
      beard or moustache to speak of. That is the end of my long story.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This will reach you on your birthday perhaps my dearest Friend; at [
      <span class="unclear">any rate</span>]
       it must
      [
      <span class="unclear">bear you a</span>]
      
      greeting of love and fond remembrance [
      <span class="unclear">for that dear day such</span>]
       as my heart will
      send you when it actually comes: patiently waiting heart, with the fibres of love
      and [
      <span class="unclear">boundless</span>]
      
      trust &amp; joy &amp; hope which bind me to you bedded [
      <span class="unclear">deep,</span>]
       grown to be, during these long
      years, a very part of its [
      <span class="unclear">immortal</span>]
       substance untouchable [
      <span class="unclear">by age or varying</span>]
       moods or sickness, or
      death itself, as I surely [
      <span class="unclear">believe.</span>]
       I long more than words can tell to know how it fares with
      you [
      <span class="unclear">now in
         health</span>]
       &amp; spirit. My children [
      <span class="unclear">are all</span>]
       well &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">growing</span>]
       &amp;
      unfolding to my heart's content. Beatrice &amp; Herbert
      deeply influenced by your Poems.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
