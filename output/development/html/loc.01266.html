   <p> This item— </p>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">A new edition of Walt Whitman's works, has been
      brought out in London, with an appendix containing the opinions of George Eliot,
      Ruskin, Tennyson, Swinburne, Rossetti and others concerning Whitman.<sup><a href="#loc.01266_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   
   
   <p></span><span> is printed in the papers here of late—I
      suppose fictitious information—But I thought I would write to you to ask
      if you know or have heard. Is it not a mistake for the Wilson &amp; McCormick
      edition, (from the plates here)?<sup><a href="#loc.01266_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—But that has
      no "appendix" as mentioned above. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I am well as usual—Dr Bucke was down from Canada a short time since to see
      me. I get the "Record" from your establishment, &amp; thank you.
