   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you a hurried line as Herbert is going up for a few days—I want to come up
      &amp; be with you all awhile—I am getting much nearer to Herby, &amp; he is already a great
      comfort to me—I keep well as lately, &amp; enjoy the creek &amp;c as much as ever—but perhaps
      a little variation would be acceptable &amp; salutary to me—I shall come up soon—let us
      all be together awhile if agreeable, (I am not willing to have Herby absent when I
      am there)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have you been over to Camden since? I was so much obliged to you for your good letter
      about my sister &amp; all, &amp; your kind invitation to my neices which I have sent on to them. This morning is cloudy &amp; a little chilly—Love to you,
      dearest friend, &amp; to Bee &amp; Giddy<sup><a href="#upa.00174_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—We will all see each other soon—
