      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It has been a good move of me coming here, as I am pleasantly situated, 
      have two rooms on 2d floor, with north &amp; south windows, so I can have the breeze through—I can have what
      I wish in the grub line—have plenty of good strawberries—&amp; my brother &amp; sister are
      very kind—It is very quiet, &amp; I feel like going in for getting 
      
      
      well—There is not much change so far—but I feel comparatively comfortable 
      since I have been here—&amp; better satisfied<sup><a href="#loc.01741_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>My brother is full of work (inspecting pipe, manufactured here at the foundries for
      Water Works, 
      &amp; Sewers, northern cities)—he is in splendid health,—a great stout fellow—weighs more
      than I do—he is building a handsome new house here, to be done latter part of August—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Thursday, 19th
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nothing very new—I have had some bad feeling in the head yesterday afternoon &amp; this
      morning—but it will pass over, no doubt—It is warm weather here, days, but pleasant
      nights so far—Pete, when you get the <u>Star</u> save it &amp; send to me—you can send two in a wrapper 
      with a one cent stamp, (I enclose some, for fear you havn't any)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Friday, 20th
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pretty hot weather here &amp; needs rain badly—I am about the same—feel pretty well for
      a 
      
      
      while, &amp; then have a bad spell—have distress in the head at times, 
      but keep up a good heart—or at any rate try to—Give my respects to all inquiring friends—tell
      them I expect to return to Washington in about a couple of months—tell me who you
      meet, &amp; every little thing, &amp; who asks about me, &amp;c. as it will interest me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I have made a raise of some new summer clothes, real nice—thin black pants &amp; vest,
      
      a blue flannel suit, &amp; some white vests—Love to Wash Milburn—let him read this 
      letter if he wishes—Write how you are getting along—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01741_n2">1. This letter is addressed:
      Peter Doyle | M street south, | bet 4½ &amp; 6th | Washington, D. C. It is
      postmarked: Camden, N.J. | 20.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01741_n1">2. Whitman's description of
      life in George's home is in sharp contrast with the querulous letters of his
      mother in the six months preceding her death.<a href="#r2">[back]
