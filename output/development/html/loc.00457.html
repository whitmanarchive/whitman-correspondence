      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Dec 8th 1872
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your various letters were received. I was up to Chicago<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> when they arrived and thus Mattie did not get [them] for a few days after they came
      to the office. Mattie is pretty sick &nbsp;she has had a great deal of trouble with her
      right arm and hand—a[nd] is not able to use it to write just now—for the last few
      days she has suffered the torments of Hell in being blistered—she had four large strong
      blisters on her at once and this morning I had to thake them off or I feared she would go crazy—she is some easier now—yet suffers much from
      the terrible places places left by these blisters &nbsp;It seems to have helped her arm and hand some and perhaps
      her lungs a little yet she coughs a grat deal &nbsp;Since the receipt of your letter saying that you would not come out here Mat
      has about given up her idea of going East—at any rate just now she is altogether too
      sick to think of such a thing. She has had quite a sleep this (Sunday) morning the
      first since Wednesday last. As soon as the places heal up a little I hope she will
      be comfortable—yet my dear Mother it is no use to try and think she is getting better—she
      is failing all the time—yet by care and attention and all that I hope she will get through the winter and if she does I shall try and get her to go out towards California
      or into the Rocky Mountains<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &nbsp;As good luck would have it we have been more than fortunate in regard to help—Mat
      had two girls, sisters, one a good cook and the other [a] house girl &nbsp;some fellow
      came out from Jersey City and married the house girl and the cook thought she would
      leave but as she had another sister also a cook Mat made an arrangement by which the
      second cook came to us as cook and our old one took the place of the married one &nbsp;so
      you see we are in good condition for eating—they do splendidly and Mat has not the
      least care of either house or house keeping
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The children are perfectly well and go to school regularly &nbsp;Jess has just begun to
      take lessons in music and they both go to dancing school<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—so all this—with the marketing and going to the stores—occupies all their time—indeed
      they seem to work as hard as anyone
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just had to stop and go over to the bed and dress these blister sores with
      sweet oil—Mat is suffering very much—you may know how much when I tell you that for
      the first time she cannot restrain groaning—I do not know whether the Dr will like
      my taking off the blisters or not—but I do know that Mat could not have stood it many
      hours longer
   </p>
   
   <p>We have just commenced with the horse sickness here<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> and it is quite an interesting thing to see how quickly people in a big city will adapt themselves to circumstances—only a few days ago and all the
      affairs and business that the horse entered into were progressing the same as usual—to-day
      not one hundretth of the horses are out—oxen quite plenty—last night a fire broke out—the fire engines
      were on the spot pretty near as soon as usual—but drawn in the old fashioned way by
      men.
   </p>
   
   <p>My own horse is sick but not very bad—yet bad enough to make me feel mighty sorry
      for him—I hav'nt had him out since last Tuesday—I hope he will not be out of use more than a week
   </p>
   
   <p>I was up to Chicago last week &nbsp;Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> came down from Milwaukee to see me, we had a few hours of good old fashioned talk
      and I was extremely glad to see him—he looks first rate, certainly coming west was
      a good move for Lane
   </p>
   
   <p>We noted what you said about receiving a letter from Jo Barkeloo<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—and nothing would give Mat more pleasure than to make them a visit—but she cannot
      think of such a thing now—I hope she may be able to accept the invitation next season
   </p>
   
   <p>I am well, have a good deal to do but still manage to get along well enough—the works
      progress well and we have just worked through a pretty bad season—but we got through
      without much trouble after all
   </p>
   
   <p>How do you do, dear Mammy &nbsp;How goes it with you? What sort of wine did you get and how do you like it?<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> How is George and Loo and Ed—how I would like to see you all—does George still have
      plenty of work—What do you hear from Han—I suppose Walt comes to see you now and then—Has
      Ed found a church in Camden to his liking—it must be quite a draw back to the Bedford
      Av affair, Ed's leaving &nbsp;have they had to shut up the shop on account of Ed's moving
      away from Brooklyn
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you ever get over to Philadelphia, and if so how do you like it? and a thousand
      other things I would like to ask you if I could see you
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you ever hear from Brooklyn? I suppose George does tell him to drop me a line and tell me how things go there since the new dispensation<sup><a href="#loc.00457_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Well dear Mammy I guess I will consider this a dose for this time—you must write whenever
      you can—all send love—Mat and I and the children too are much very much, disappointed
      that you do not think well of coming out and staying the winter with us—did you know
      how easy the travel is you would not mind that part of it
   </p>
   
   <p>All send love to Loo and George and Ed—I will try and write a little more frequently</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00457_n1">1. Jeff may have been
      consulting, especially since his old boss Moses Lane had recently worked with E.
      S. Chesbrough, the chief engineer of the Chicago Sewerage Commission.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n2">2. As early as March 1872
      Mattie made reference to a proposed trip west for her health (Randall H.
      Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], p. 76).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n3">3. According to Mattie's
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of October 28, 1872, both Hattie and Jessie
      were taking dancing and music lessons. Their music teacher was a Mr. Bowman
      (Waldron, p. 59); their dancing teacher was probably either Carl Emilie or
      Julius Blemner, both of whom had "Dancing Academies" at this time.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n4">4. The nationwide epidemic
      of horse disease swept over St. Louis in December 1872, disabling nearly all of
      the horses and mules. Businesses requiring the use of these animals were
      suspended, and the fire department had to hire 350 additional men to pull
      equipment to fires.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n5">5. See . Lane was appointed chief engineer in charge of constructing the
      Milwaukee waterworks in 1871.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n6">6. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman received letters from Josephine Barkeloo dated October 17, November 3,
      and December 16, 1872 (Walt Whitman Papers, Library of Congress). Like Helen
      Price, "Joe" seems to have been deeply attached to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      and she was also fond of the Jefferson Whitmans. The first of her letters closes
      in an unusually intimate way: "it is my bed hour. Good night, you are in your
      dreams, and I am kissing you in imagination &nbsp;you half awaken and say 'Is that
      you—Walter?' but you are mistaken &nbsp;it was—Yours truly, Joe."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n7">7. See .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00457_n8">8. On April 28, 1872,
      Brooklyn again reorganized the administration of the waterworks by creating a
      Board of City Works, which in 1873 was renamed the Department of City Works.
      Jeff's old friend Colonel Julius W. Adams remained chief engineer despite the
      changes.<a href="#r8">[back]
