   <p>I have just returned from a two weeks' visit down in the Jersey pine woods and had
      a good time in the simple, savage way I like. Am well for me, sunburnt and fat. (Some
      twitchings, but I don't dwell on them.) Nothing very new in my affairs, sell a couple
      of books occasionally.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose you saw my Riddle Song in the first number of Sunnyside Press<sup><a href="#med.00636_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—if not, I can send you the "Progress" with it in.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I delivered my Lincoln lecture last April 15 in Philadelphia—the same as the N.Y.
      version. I took it very coolly and enjoyed it—(No great audience—$90, after paying
      expenses).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mr. Abbott of Boston wrote to me for a poem for his May 22d "Emerson Number" of the
      "Literary World." I could not write him a poem, but I sent him a little prose criticism
      which I believe he is to print in said number.<sup><a href="#med.00636_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Dr. Bucke is coming here to Philadelphia about May 22.<sup><a href="#med.00636_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Eldridge passed through here day before yesterday, returning to Washington . . .
      .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had the May "Scribner" and read it leisurely down in the woods—Stedman's Poe, and
      your "Notes."<sup><a href="#med.00636_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> (Scratched off my Emerson screed down there, as it was there I rec'd Abbott's letter.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear from the Gilchrists; they are in London; the daughter Beatrice has suddenly
      abandoned her medical pursuits and intentions. Herbert thrives<sup><a href="#med.00636_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>. . . .
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hear at second remove, and vaguely, that Symonds is writing a book, or something,
      about me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>. . . When you write, send me Smith Caswell's exact post office address, so I can
      send him papers.<sup><a href="#med.00636_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Don't forget.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Is it <em>you</em> who says so emphatically the blackbirds don't sing? What they call here the Virginia
      blackbird, with red dabbed shoulders—Harry Stafford says they do, at times, and very
      finely (and I say so, too)—How are you? How the arm? how the babe? Love to 'Sula—
