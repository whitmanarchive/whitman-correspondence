      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have long been waiting for an opportunity to invite you to my house here, under
      circumstances which would be agreeable to you, and now the time seems to have come.<sup><a href="#n0915" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      We have here this summer a school of philosophy<sup><a href="#n3031" id="r2">2</a></sup> which has drawn hither many
      thoughtful persons, and furnishes an 
      
      occasion for saying many good
      things. I mailed you the 
      programme
      
       some days ago, and now write to invite you to come to my house for a week
      or two after the 26th when some friends who are visiting me will take their leave. I
      am in a new house where I can give you freedom and some degree of comfort, and shall
      esteem it a favor if you will make it your home for a time.
   </p>
   
   <p>The newspapers report you as ill in Canada. I hope this is not so, and that you may
      be
      well enough to make the journey hither; while here you may rest or be active as you
      may choose.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0915">1. Franklin B. Sanborn
      (1831–1917) was an abolitionist and a friend of John Brown. In 1860, when
      he was tried in Boston because of his refusal to testify before a committee of
      the U.S. Senate, Whitman was in the courtroom (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: Macmillan, 1955], 242). He
      reviewed <em>Drum-Taps</em> in the <em>Boston
         Commonwealth</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/drumtaps/anc.00059.html">February 24, 1866</a>. He was editor of the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> from 1868 to 1872, and was the author of books dealing with
      his friends Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott. "A Visit to the Good Gray Poet"
      appeared without Sanborn's name in the <em>Springfield
         Republican</em> on April 19, 1876. For more on Sanborn, see Linda K. Walker,
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_206.html">Sanborn, Franklin Benjamin (Frank) (1831–1917)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3031">2. The Concord School of Philosophy
      was a series of lectures held at Amos Bronson Alcott's Hillside Chapel in
      Concord, Massachusetts, from 1879 to 1888.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
