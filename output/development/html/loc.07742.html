   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07319_n6">2. Frank Warren Fritzinger
      (1867–1899), known as "Warry," took Edward Wilkins's place as Whitman's
      nurse, beginning in October 1889. Fritzinger and his brother Harry were the sons
      of Henry Whireman Fritzinger (about 1828–1881), a blind sea captain, and
      Almira E. Fritzinger. Following Henry Sr.'s death, Warren and his
      brother–having lost both parents–became wards of Mary O. Davis,
      Whitman's housekeeper, who had also taken care of the sea captain and who
      inherited part of his estate. <a href="#r2">[back]

      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
