      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your telegram just 
      rec'd—Your letter 
      rec'd
      
       last Monday—I had however sent proofs of the entire Introductory
      Letter by Sunday night's mail hence in a parcel to Washington—&amp; I have just
      sent a letter directed to (Acting) Chief Clerk L S S, asking him (if not already
      done) to forward the parcel to you at Providence—
   </p>
   
   <p>I last night forwarded proofs of good part of the G[ood] G[ray] P[oet] to you at
      Providence direct—will forward the rest in a day or two—
   </p>
   
   <p>I send best love to Nelly, I send best sympathy and love to the dear sufferer
      Jeannie<sup><a href="#nyp.00481_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Love too to Dr and Mrs Channing,<sup><a href="#nyp.00481_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; their children—
   </p>
   
   <p>Beautiful sunny day here—noon—the window open as I write—Dr
      B[ucke]'s book is half in type—Send the proofs back soon as
      convenient—(no immanent hurry)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Yes, I like the letter very much—</p>
   
   <p>I am well as usual—</p>
