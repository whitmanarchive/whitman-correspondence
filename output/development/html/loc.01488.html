   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have received your kind letter, &amp; your review in the Westminster, &amp; thank
      you heartily. I wish to write you at more length, &amp; may do so before long. I
      take real comfort in the thought that I have such friends in
      
      Ireland, including yourself. I wish to hear more of Mr. Tyrrell,<sup><a href="#loc.01488_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> whom you speak of.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Dowden (1843–1913),
      professor of English literature at the University of Dublin, sent a copy of his
      article with a letter on July 23: "I ought to say that the article expresses
      very partially the impression which your writings have made on me. It keeps, as
      is obvious, at a single point of view, &amp; regards only what becomes visible
      from that point. But also I wrote more cooly than I feel because I wanted those,
      who being ignorant of your writings are perhaps prejudiced against them, to say
      'Here is a cool, judicious, impartial critic who finds a great deal in
      Whitman—perhaps, after all, we are mistaken' " (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection; Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [1906–1996], 9 vols., 1:134). Note also Dowden's comments to Burroughs, in
      Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em>
      (1931), 67. On three occasions in 1870 Dowden had written to Rossetti about his
      difficulties in having his article published; see Rossetti Papers,
      517–518, 519, 520. In 1888 Whitman observed to Horace Traubel: "Dowden is
      a book-man: but he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is
      where we connect" (<em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      1:299).
