   </p>
   
   <p>
      I received your letter of the 23rd with enclosing "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1891/poems/388.html">Osceola</a>"
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/LG/1891/poems/386.html">A Twilight Song</a>" and 
      "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">To the Sunset Breeze</a>," and also
      a copy of a September Philadelphia Press with a poem on you, all right, and feel that
      I cannot express my thanks (on behalf of us all)
      sufficiently to you for your noble kindness to us. I fear I detected a tone of weariness
      and affliction between the lines and can only
      say we are sorry from our hearts that your winter days should be so.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am sorry that your Touchstone (Mr. Bury) had to return from England before crossing
      to you. He was detained long over the
      strike &amp; business connected with it. I wrote to him &amp; told him of all your expressions
      of good will and greetings
      of love to him &amp; us all. I enclose his letter to me.
      
   </p>
   
   <p> There is much misery &amp; pinching among us in Australia over the strike. The men lost,
      as was inevitable, 
      <u>this time,</u> but I do not think it is really a loss after all.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Fred &amp; Jim and Ada &amp; Ted &amp; mr &amp; mrs Fryer &amp; my wife all send their love to you, bound
      with every good wish for you. We are anxiously waiting to hear the result of Ingersoll's
      goodness.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      (I believe they have a secret good word for you, for this reason. I used to bother
      them a lot with a series of 
      serrated word-groups that I called poetry, but since your influence came, they have
      been shared, &amp; I have no doubt,
      are thankful accordingly.)
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I thank you again for "To the Sunset Breeze." Somehow I feel your spirit at its best
      through that: it is a kind
      of commentary (among other things) on the unexplainable (to me) feeling of friendship
      with, at times, the hot wind on the central
      plains, at others, the gale from the ice-teeth of the Southern Pole. Your breeze isn't
      like them but you know the language of which
      they are a (perhaps harsh) dialect. I thank you too for the precious gift of a poem
      signed by yourself with your own name.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      I am finished now.
      
   </p>

      P.S. Will you please send me for Jim Hartigan, Fred Woods &amp; myself three (3) "Complete
      Poems &amp; Prose" to same address as this (Â£ 5 enclosed)
