   <p>I have yours of Saturday and Sunday with enclosures—I like the "71<u>st</u>
      Year"<sup><a href="#loc.07321_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> very
      much—am glad to have Arnold's sonnet<sup><a href="#loc.07321_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and E. Gosse on Tennyson's
      "Throstle"<sup><a href="#loc.07321_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I have not seen Ed. Wilkins<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> yet, nor (of course) got the
      photo's<sup><a href="#loc.07321_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>—he is to be here this afternoon or evening I believe. Nothing new from
      Willy Gurd.<sup><a href="#n4284" id="r6">6</a></sup> I expect to go to Guelph (Ont.) tomorrow to give
      evidence on a murder trial (whether the homicide is sane or not). I lectured to
      students 2½ hours yesterday afternoon. We are all well—The poor P. of
      Wales seems from the reports to be very ill—looks as if he would never
      ascend the throne

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07321_n1">1. Bucke is referring to
      Whitman's poem "," which was first published in the November 1889 issue of
      the <em>Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine</em>. In his letter
      of  Whitman sent Bucke a reprint of
      the poem with corrections.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07321_n2">2. Bucke is referring to the English poet and journalist Sir Edwin Arnold
      (1832–1904). The sonnet is unidentified.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07321_n3">3. Throstle" was a parody of
      Tennyson by the English poet and author Edmund Gosse (1849–1928). Whitman 
      mentions "Throstle" in his letters to Bucke of, , and .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07321_n4">5. See Whitman's  letter to Bucke in which the poet
      states that Wilkins would soon be delivering a package of portraits to Bucke. In his
      letter to Whitman
      of , Bucke reports that Wilkins
      visited him and brought the photographs the previous evening, October 29,
      1889.

   <p id="n4284">6. William John Gurd (1845–1903)
      was Richard Maurice Bucke's brother-in-law, with whom he was designing a gas and
      fluid meter to be patented in Canada and sold in England. Bucke believed the
      meter would be worth "millions of dollars," while Whitman remained skeptical,
      sometimes to Bucke's annoyance. In a , letter to William D. O'Connor, Whitman wrote, "The practical
      outset of the meter enterprise collapsed at the last moment for the want of
      capital investors."
