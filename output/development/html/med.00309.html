   <p>. . . I believe I have told you all that occurs to me, only I must let you know that
      your notion I may have forgotten you is not regular by a long shot. I do not forget
      any one so easily, where the friendship has been formed as it was under such circumstances
      as yours &amp; mine in the hospital. You must write to me whenever you feel like it—tell
      me all about things &amp; people down there in Kentucky—God bless you, my loving soldier
      boy, &amp; for the present, Farewell.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00309_n2">1. Excerpts from five of
      Whitman's letters to an unidentified ex-soldier were printed by Florence
      Hardiman Miller in the <em>Overland Monthly</em>. According to
      Edward Havilland Miller, most of the letters have not been dated because of the
      fragmentary nature of her quotations, and the identity of the recipient is also
      unknown. Evidently he came from Kentucky and later moved to California. Florence
      Miller's transcripts are not reliable, as evidenced by a comparison of the
      facsimile (63) with the transcription
      (61).
      Miss Miller, who generally is more exuberant than factual, seems to imply that
      the correspondence continued into the early 1870s. Until the originals are
      found, this attempt at reconstruction will have to suffice; see Whitman's
      letters to soldiers from 
      , 
      , 
      , and
