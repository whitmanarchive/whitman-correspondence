   <p>If you put this in type perhaps you could send me a proof <em>to-morrow Tuesday afternoon say by 2, (if convenient order it so, specifically)</em>—It will make, I think, from 1½ to 1¾ columns—Can you use it in Wednesday's paper?<sup><a href="#loc.04040_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I have another screed—<em>Central Park jottings</em>, &amp;c<sup><a href="#loc.04040_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—which I think of offering you for Saturday's paper—I return to Camden in a few days—
