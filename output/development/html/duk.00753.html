      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of May 23d has reach'd me here—I am unable to give you any information on the
      genealogic points you speak of—wish I could—I have an idea there are town records
      or documents at Huntington, that are accessible, &amp; that might throw light on the Van
      Wyck and Whitman families—I have seen such records alluded to, &amp; printed extracts
      from them—where they are, or what office, in Huntington I think, or who keeps them,
      I can not say—Yes I was born at West Hills—my father Walter Whitman—I trace the Whitmans
      there four generations—my grandmother (father's mother) was Hannah <em>Brush</em><sup><a href="#duk.00753_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I am here on a visit—go back, last of next week, to Camden New Jersey, my regular
      p o address.
   </p>
