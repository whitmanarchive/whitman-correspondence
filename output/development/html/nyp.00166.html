      <br></br><br></br>Dear Comrade
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received your kind letter, and it will be impossible for me to tell how glad I was
      to hear from you again though very sorry to hear that you had been sick. Oh! I should
      like to have been with you so I could have nursed you back to health &amp; strength, but
      if you were with your mother no doubt you were taken care of better than I could have
      done for you but I would liked to have been with you anyway I could have read to you
      and talked <em>with</em> you if nothing more  I am afraid I shall never be able to recompense you for your
      kind care and the trouble I made you while I was sick in the hospital unless you are
      already paid by knowing you have helped the sick and suffering soldiers many of them
      will never cease to remember you and to ask God's blessing to rest upon you while
      you and they live  there is no one such as you at least I have often thought of you
      and wondered where you were if you were still visiting Armory Square Hospt  I believe
      I wrote to you that you had two Children instead of one, you know I used to call you
      Father or "Pa," and I still think of you as such for I am sure no Father could have
      cared for their own child, better than you did me, if you could see your other child
      I think you would like her better than you did me for I do. I have also been very
      sick since you heard from me, for two weeks I knew nothing, was perfectly insane.
      I was taken with some kind of spasm and for two or three days many said I could not
      live but I had a good Doctor and have almost regained my health but think I shall
      never be able to do hard work again  Mary sends her love to you she often talks about
      you  she sends her thanks to you for your kindness to me and hopes you may soon regain
      your health, but I must stop for this time  write soon and often  the reason I did
      not write was that I wrote once and received no answer  I thought you had left there
      but now you shall hear from me often  no more  I remain your Son &amp; Comrade   E. D.
      Fox

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elijah Douglass Fox was a
      Union soldier in the Third Infantry Wisconsin. At the time of his enlistment in
      May 1861, he resided in Buena Vista, Wisconsin. According to the "Notebook:
      Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Fox was brought
      to Armory Square Hospital on September 26, 1863; it was here where he met Walt
      Whitman. He was discharged from the Union army on November 10, 1863, due to
      disability. Fox often addressed Whitman as "father" in his correspondence; see
      Fox's , as an example of
      Whitman's paternal relationship with Fox.
