      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The pleasantest event since I last wrote has been a visit from Mr. Eldridge.<sup><a href="#loc.00944_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> We had a long, friendly chat that did me good. Saturday evening we went to one of
      Miss Booth's<sup><a href="#n3017" id="r3">3</a></sup> receptions—met Joaquin Miller<sup><a href="#n0412" id="r4">4</a></sup> there, who is just back from Europe—of course we talked of you. Mrs. Moulton<sup><a href="#n0422" id="r5">5</a></sup> too is hoping so you will come to New York during her stay here, which is to last
      a week or two longer. John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r6">6</a></sup> has just sent me a post card to say he has returned from a 3-weeks stay with his
      folks in Delaware Co.—that he hopes to come here soon—wants Mrs. Burroughs<sup><a href="#prc.00047_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> to come too &amp; board for a month or so—wants also "Walt to come—&amp; lecture"—but "Walt
      will not be hurried." Did I tell you that we found boarding here a young man, Mr.
      Arthur Holland, one of the family who were so very friendly to me &amp; made my stay so
      pleasant both in Concord &amp; Cambridge? He often comes to our room of an evening for
      an hour or two's chat, &amp; by the bye, being connected with the iron trade he has been
      able to make some enquiries for me as to what Per's<sup><a href="#n2000" id="r8">8</a></sup> chances as a scientific metallurgist would be in this country—&amp; I am sorry to say
      he thinks they would be very poor indeed. Prof. Lesley<sup><a href="#n0358" id="r9">9</a></sup> said the same thing; so it is clear I must not urge him to try the experiment, seeing
      he has a wife &amp; child. Herby<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r10">10</a></sup> &amp; Giddy<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r11">11</a></sup> both well. Love from us all. Good bye, Dear Friend.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0259">1. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00944_n3">2. Charles W. Eldridge was
      one half of the Boston based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge,
      who put out the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In
      December 1862, on his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg,
      Virginia, Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become
      a clerk in the office of the army paymaster and eventually obtained a desk for
      Whitman in the office of Major Lyman Hapgood, the army paymaster. For more on
      Whitman's relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge
         (1837–1903)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3017">3. Mary Louise Booth (1831–1889)
      was the first editor of the New York-based <em>Harper's
         Bazaar</em>, one of the first fashion magazines of its time. Booth also
      translated around 40 works of French literature and wrote a history of New York.
      For more on Booth and the <em>Bazaar</em>, see Paula Bernat
      Bennett, "Subtle Subversion: Mary Louise Booth and <em>Harper's
         Bazaar</em> (1867–1889)," in <em>Blue Pencils &amp;
         Hidden Hands: Women Editing Periodicals, 1830–1910</em> (Boston:
      Northeastern University Press, 2004), 225–247.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0412">4. Joaquin Miller was the pen name of Cincinnatus Heine
      Miller (1837–1913), an American poet nicknamed "Byron of the Rockies" and
      "Poet of the Sierras." In 1871, the <em>Westminster Review</em>
      described Miller as "leaving out the coarseness which marked Walt Whitman's
      poetry." In an entry in his journal dated August 1, 1871, John Burroughs
      recorded Whitman's fondness for Miller's poetry; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin Co., 1931), 60. Whitman met Miller for the first time later in 1872; he
      wrote of a visit with Miller in a 
      letter to Charles W. Eldridge.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0422">5. Ellen Louise Chandler Moulton (1835–1908), an
      American poet and critic, was staying with Philip Bourke Marston (to whom
      Whitman wrote on ), whose works
      she edited after his premature death in 1887. See Lilian Whiting, <em>Louise Chandler Moulton, Poet and Friend</em> (1910).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">6. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n2000">8. Percy Carlyle Gilchrist
      (1851–1935) was a British chemist and metallurgist, and the son of
      Alexander and Anne Gilchrist. Along with his cousin, Sidney Gilchrist Thomas, he
      developed the Thomas-Gilchrist process of producing steel from phosphoric pig
      iron during the late 1870s. See Marion Walker Alcaro, <em>Walt
         Whitman's Mrs. G: A Biography of Anne Gilchrist</em> (Cranbury, N.J.:
      Associated University Presses, 1991), 252 n28.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0358">9. Professor John Peter Lesley (1819–1903) was
      appointed state geologist of University of Pennsylvania in 1874. He was also
      secretary of the American Philosophical Society from 1858 to 1885. In 1849,
      Lesley married Susan Inches Lyman (1823–1904), the daughter of Judge
      Joseph Lyman (1767–1847) of Northampton, Mass. His daughters were Margaret
      White Lesley Bush-Brown and Mary Lesley Ames (both mentioned in Whitman's , letter to Ellen O'Connor). Anne
      Gilchrist spoke glowingly of the "delightful family circle" of the Lesleys
      (Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist, <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and
         Writings</em> (1887), 228–229).<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">10. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.

   <p id="n0890">11. Grace Gilchrist Frend
      (1859–1947) was one of Anne Gilchrist's four children and Herbert's
      sister. She became a contralto. She was the author of "Walt Whitman as I
      Remember Him" (<em>Bookman</em> 72 [July 1927],
      203–205).<a href="#r11">[back]
