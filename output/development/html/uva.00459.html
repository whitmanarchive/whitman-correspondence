   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George M. Williamson was a New York
      book collector who contacted Whitman several times about purchasing manuscripts,
      and later published <em>Catalogue of A Collection of Books,
         Letters, and Manuscripts written by Walt Whitman, in the Library of George
         M. Williamson, Grand View on Hudson</em> (New York: The Marion Press, 1903).
      Other items in Williamson's collection, which was sold at auction in 1908,
      included George Washington's copy of <em>Don Quixote</em>, a
      presentation copy of Longfellow's "Evangeline," Hawthorne's annotated copy of
      <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>, and "a very remarkable collection
      of Walt Whitman's works" (<em>The George M. Williamson
         Collection</em> [Anderson Galleries, Inc., 1908]).
