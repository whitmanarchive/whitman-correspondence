      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I mailed a letter to you either last Friday or Saturday, containing $11. 10 from Hill
      &amp; Newman and $1. from Henry Carlow &nbsp;On Tuesday I again wrote you, sending you $4…$2
      from Theo. A. Drake and 2 from "Cash" through John D. Martin<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;The enclosed $5 is from our friend Mr. E. Rae.<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> He gave it to me last night &nbsp; I left him a couple of letters to read and I want you
      to write him one of the same kind of letters asking him to show it to some of his
      friends and if they have anything to devote to the purpose for him to send it directly
      to you or through me. Walt, I know Rae is a liberal hearted man and through his friends
      he could do a great deal and I am confident that he could be more earnestly interested
      in the matter if you write him directly. Please acknowledge the receipt of this and the others (if received)
      so that I may be positive that the money is reaching you. Ive no doubt we shall keep dribbling along, a few dollars at a time, for some time yet.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are all about the same at home as when I last wrote. Mother is of course quite
      worried about the moving of the 9th Army Corps and very much disappointed that George
      will not have an opportunity to come home and see us.<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> We are all getting well of our colds, last night Mother had a very bad sore throat
      but I made her some "hot stuff" and she was much better this morning. Mat and Sis
      have nearly recovered and are all right I guess. In George's letter he speaks of wanting
      $20. We think of sending it to him by Capt. Simms,<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> who is now here, and I think it will be the better and safer way.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am really much disappointed that George should have to go in the thickest of the danger. I certainly feel that
      he is doing wrong if there is any possible way for him to avoid it. However I try
      to put as good a face on the matter as possible and sincerely hope for the best &nbsp;Tis
      too bad that he should just have got his hut done and then have to go away and leave
      it.<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>How goes matters with you Walt? Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> will send you the letters I spoke of in a day or two. I wish you could make it so
      that you could visit George before they leave Fortress Monroe &nbsp;Do if you possibly
      can. I am having a plan for a small 2 Story house (22 x 32) made and shall try to
      get Rae to build it for me. the only question that I am not clear on and am wanting
      advice is the position that I shall put on the lot, front or rear. I have almost made
      up my mind to set it so that a 65 or 70 x 20 foot lot can at any time be made in front, and the <em>only</em> objection to placing it in that position is the location of the privy in the next
      yard, which in this case would be right abreast of the center of the house thus<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> &nbsp;I do not fear that it would amount to anything unless 'twould damage the cellar in some manner. Unless I am convinced that it will be some damage
      <em>via</em> the
      <br><br><img class="teiFigure" src="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/figures/loc.00399.001.jpg"><br><br>
      cellar I shall place it as above. Let me know what you think of it. (The above sketch
      is not at all in proportion, but may convey an idea to you what I mean) &nbsp;The front
      lot will be quite ample, I think, (65 x 20) when you take in consideration that there
      will neither have to be a privy or cistern in the yard, and you will be able to have
      a gate in the ally which is quite an advantage. Mr Lane compliments me highly on my
      bargain and says I have done <em>well</em>. I hope I have but I am as ignorant about these matters as a baby. However I am bound
      to go through with it now, sink or tother thing.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear brother write me. If you see dear dear Brother George tell him how fondly we
      looked for his coming home and assure him that we were <em>all</em> much, very much disappointed. All send their love to you and you may be assured you
      are never absent from our minds.

   <p>The enclosed letter Mr Lane gave me to send you, wishing me to say that undoubtedly
      this Mr Webster<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> could help you and if he did it would be with the idea that it would help him somehow
      at some future period, That you must use him (Webster) if you can. Mr Lane sends his
      respects to you
   </p>
   
   <p>At Dinner time to-day Mother told me that Andrew had been discharged from the yard.
      Tis too bad but I presume it is on account of his not being there much of the time.
      I hardly know what Nancy<sup><a href="#loc.00399_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> is to do with her two children.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00399_n1">1. This firm has not been
      identified. Henry P. Hill, James Hill, and Warren Hill were engineers; Simon
      Hill, Samuel Hill, and Thomas Newman were contractors. Henry Carlow, an
      engineer, is listed in the Brooklyn directory for 1859–60, but not in the
      subsequent years. Theodore A. Drake was a waterworks inspector and John D.
      Martin an engineer.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n2">2. Edwin Haviland Miller
      reads this as "Rae" (Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:78, n46), but Jerome M.
      Loving reads this as "Rac" (Loving, ed., <em>Civil War Letters of
         George Washington Whitman</em> [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 1975],
      71, n7). We agree with Miller and believe Jeff refers to Edmund H. Rae, a notary
      and copyist who lived in Brooklyn but kept offices at 13 Wall Street, New York
      City. It is not clear why Jeff would consider having Rae build his house.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n3">3. General Ambrose
      Burnside's men, including George, travelled from Falmouth to Newport News,
      Virginia, crossing the Rappahannock River in the infamous "mud march"—an
      unsuccessful attempt to capture Fredericksburg. George came home March 7.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n4">4. Samuel H. Sims, a
      captain in George Washington Whitman's Fifty-first New York Volunteer Regiment,
      had been the subject in part of Walt Whitman's article, "Our Brooklyn Boys in
      the War," which appeared in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, on
      January 5, 1863. Sims died on July 30, 1864, of wounds received near Petersburg,
      Virginia (see George Washington Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      from ). Walt Whitman may have lived
      in Sims's tent during part of his stay at Falmouth, Virginia, opposite
      Fredericksburg—a trip that Walt took in search of George after reading his
      brother's name in the <em>New York Herald</em> listed among the
      wounded in the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. As it turned out,
      George only suffered a minor injury; George wrote in a letter to his mother on
      : "I have come out safe and
      sound, although I had the side of my jaw slightly scraped with a peice of shell
      which burst at my feet."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n5">5. On , Geroge wrote to Walt Whitman: "I
      have my log hut partly finished and should have had it completed long ago, but
      after I had cut the logs...orders came for us to be ready to move the next day
      so I used the logs for fire wood."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n6">6. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Like Jeff Whitman, he collected money from his employees
      and friends for Walt's hospital work. Lane sent Whitman $15.20 in his letter of
      , and later various sums which
      Whitman acknowledged in letters from , , , and . In his letter of , Lane pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the
      Henry W. and Albert A. Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Whitman wrote,
      obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum of money,
      contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York, (chiefly
      through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted Whitman
      in other ways as well (see Whitman's letters from , and ). He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for your
      own especial benefit."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n7">7. Jeff's sketch occurs
      here. It is reproduced about twice the size of the original.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n8">8. On February 12, 1863,
      Moses Lane wrote to E. D. Webster: "Mr. W. has been for a long time connected
      with the New York Press and is a writer of most decided ability. His patriotism
      and loyalty you can rely upon under all circumstances" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection, Library of Congress).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00399_n9">9. Whitman scholars have
      assumed that Nancy was Andrew Whitman's common-law wife. However, on September
      22, 1852, Hannah wrote to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman: "tell me who Andrew is
      reported to be married to" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University
      Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library). It seems more likely
      that this remark would have been prompted by a legal marriage rather than by a
      common-law marriage.<a href="#r9">[back]
