   </p>
   
   <p>Please accept my lasting acknowledgement for the copy of "November Boughs"<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r2">2</a></sup> so kindly
      sent me through the persuasion of our friend Mr Harned.<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>This expression of your goodness I did not expect nor deserve. I sought only 
      thro'
      
       Tom Harned a line from your hand to place in my copy of 'Leaves of
      Grass.'
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis many a year ago that I learned to love your noble, honest robust nature, and the
      immortal lines that flowed from your virile  and vigorous pen.
   </p>
   
   <p>Your poetry above all others is stamped with intense sincerity and rugged beauty and
      I love it for its entire absence of pretence, cant affectation and hypocrisy.
   </p>
   
   <p>If you ever come my way I know a place hard by, where a bottle of the reddest
      Burgundy may be found that will dispel the November chill of age and make our hearts
      as joyous and generous as its own ruddy hue.
   </p>
