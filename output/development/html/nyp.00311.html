      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Friday afternoon, Sept. 5.<sup xmlns=""><a href="#nyp.00311_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I still remain here in Camden, &amp; in a condition not much different—alternating constantly
      between the bad spells, &amp; then hours, &amp; sometimes days, 
      not so bad. I suppose you rec'd the little Philadelphia paper I sent a week since—Dr.
      Grier here is confident my principal trouble is cerebral anæmia (blood not 
      properly going to the brain to nourish it)—says it arises from a long 
      continued excessive emotional action generally<sup><a href="#nyp.00311_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; thinks it so has arisen in my case—does not think writing, or study, or ordinary
      brain action has been the cause—it has been long a-coming &amp; will probably be long
      a-going—thinks I will get well however.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He thinks it has been coming on for many years, says I need rest, rest for a long
      time 
      &amp; social exhilaration—(The paralysis, according to him, is only an incident, or result,
      
      &amp; not the cause-disease)—Since I have been here I have followed Dr. Drinkard's advice—taken
      no medicine, &amp; lived very prudently—(I still quite thoroughly believe in Dr. Drinkard)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Charles Eldridge called upon me on his way back—his visit was a great treat, 
      &amp; was only too short—I rec'd a letter from him a few days since—all goes on as usual
      in Washington matters we are interested in—I have a substitute<sup><a href="#nyp.00311_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> working for me at my desk, and he seems to give satisfaction—When I shall be able
      to go to work again, if ever, is as indefinite now as it has been for over seven months—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have rec'd a letter from John Burroughs. He has bought some land at Esopus, 
      on the Hudson, west bank, some 80 miles from New York, &amp; is going 
      to build him a house &amp; home there forthwith.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I get out some—went over to Philadelphia yesterday—go sometimes 
      to the Mercantile Library Reading Room, as it is very pleasant there 
      for a change—or rather for a place to go to &amp; rest—though the atmosphere 
      of a <em>reading room</em> soon weighs on me, &amp; I feel like retreating—Yesterday 
      took a ride up in the Market st. cars to West Philadelphia—&amp; was caught in a violent shower coming home in the evening,
      &amp; nicely soaked—Soon as I got home it stopt, and we had a splendid moonlight evening—It is bright &amp; clear to-day, &amp; rather hot—It
      is socially here an utter blank to me—my cynical dread of being bored by any one is
      now completely gratified with a vengeance—I look long &amp; long at my mother's miniature,
      &amp; at my sister Mat's—I have very good one's of each—&amp; O the wish if I could only be
      with them—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, this has grown to be a perturbed sort of letter—&amp; had better be torn up—but
      I will let it go.
      
   </p>
