   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00867_n1">1. According to William
      Sloane Kennedy, whose transcription, held in the Trent Collection of Whitmaniana
      at Duke University, is the only available text, the letter was written on the
      verso of one from Eldridge to Whitman on April 14, 1887, discussing O'Connor's
      illness and his indignation over Thomas Wentworth Higginson's articles in <em>Harper's Bazar</em>: "It is fortunate for Higginson that I am
      sick." On March 5 Higginson wrote about the "proposed pension for Mr. Whitman,
      the poet; although he is not wholly an instance in point, having been a man of
      conspicuously fine physique, but who deliberately preferred service in the
      hospitals rather than in the field." On March 26, in "Women and Men. The Victory
      of the Weak," Higginson supported Lanier's attack upon the "dandyism" in
      Whitman's depiction of the "roughs."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4979">2. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
      see Christina Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_105.html">Smith, Robert Pearsall (1827–1898)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00867_n2">3. Apparently Whitman did
      not sit for Augustus Saint-Gaudens (1848–1907), since the entry in his
      Commonplace Book on the following day made no reference to the sculptor, who had
      attended the New York lecture (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="med.00797_n1">4. This is referring to
      Whitman's lecture entitled "The Death of Abraham Lincoln." He first delivered
      this lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times
      over the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He
      had published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882–83). For more on the lecture,
      see Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed.,
      (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998), 169–170.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03486_n1">5. Andrew Carnegie
      (1835–1919), the prominent industrialist and admirer of Whitman, had
      donated twice to the support of the aged poet.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0871">6. Richard Watson Gilder
      (1844–1909) was the assistant editor of <em>Scribner's
         Monthly</em> from 1870 to 1881 and editor of its successor, <em>The Century</em>, from 1881 until his death. Whitman had met
      Gilder for the first time in 1877 at John H. Johnston's (Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1955], 482). Whitman attended a reception and tea given by Gilder after William
      Cullen Bryant's funeral on June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation" in the <em>New York Tribune</em>, July 4, 1878. Whitman considered Gilder
      one of the "always sane men in the general madness" of "that New York art
      delirium" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.22.html">Sunday, August 5, 1888</a>). For more about Gilder, see Susan L.
      Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_95.html">Gilder, Richard Watson (1844–1909)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]
