      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt;
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is a long time since I have heard from you or word of you: though I have had one
      short note from Ernest Rhys, it is true, who spoke of you; &amp; of your being
      somewhat under the weather.
   </p>
   
   <p>We all liked your brief letter about the President—&amp; our Friend—Mr.
      Forman<sup><a href="#n0240" id="r1">1</a></sup> spoke of it the other evening as "very nice."
   </p>
   
   <p>It seemed to me to eminate from someone who felt pretty brisk.</p>
   
   <p>You find E. Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> a good fellow—I am heartily glad
      he is getting on so well in the States—at least he seems to be entering into
      the fun of a winter there.
   </p>
   
   <p>Last Friday evening I created a chalk &amp; charcoal portrait of Buxton Forman: he
      was delightful with it &amp; so was his wife, for whom it was a birthday present. He
      has a good characteristic head and I enjoyed making it very much.
   </p>
   
   <p>Once a week H.B. Forman is Clerk-in-Waiting at the General Post Office &amp; on those
      evenings in comfortable office lit with electric light I made the portrait.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am in the evening now planning out this large reception w 33 friends to see your
      portrait, that I spoke of in my last letter.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>If any names &amp; addresses of friends occur to you, that you would like me to ask,
      send them in your next. I have already got a good many of your friends' addresses
      but the <u>last batch</u> of subscribers through the <u>Pall Mall Gazette</u> I have <u>not</u>
      got. Mrs. Rosamund Powell (a friend of L. Morgan Brown's)<sup><a href="#n3176" id="r3">3</a></sup> sends
      (£3) through me in this letter her annual subscription (free will offering) to
      you. Let me know if you get this all-right?
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my kind rememberances to Morse,<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r4">4</a></sup> when you are writing, I expect to show his bust
      along with my others works at this reception in April.
   </p>
   
   <p>Carpenter<sup><a href="#n0141b" id="r5">5</a></sup> is well.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mont S.<sup><a href="#n0910" id="r6">6</a></sup> has been very ill as you must have heard.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0240">1. Henry Buxton Forman (1842–1917) was most
      notably the biographer and editor of Percy Shelley and John Keats. On , Buxton sent a copy of R. H.
      Horne's <em>The Great Peace-Maker; A Sub-marine Dialogue</em>
      (London, 1872) to Whitman. This poetic account of the laying of the Atlantic
      cable has a foreword written by Forman. After his death, Forman's reputation
      declined primarily because, in 1934, booksellers Graham Pollard and John Carter
      published <em>An Enquiry into the Nature of Certain Nineteenth
         Century Pamphlets</em>, which exposed Forman as a forger of many first
      "private" editions of poetry.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03310_n1">2. Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3176">3. Leonard Morgan Brown was an English
      teacher from Croton-on-Hudson, New York, who had contributed to Whitman's funds
      in the past.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">4. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0141b">5. Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
