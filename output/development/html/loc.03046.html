      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have yours of yesterday, and am happy in the thought that you find my second letter
      telling. I think it indicates the line to stick to, and I don't see how Chadwick can
      climb over it. The enemy would give much to be able to break down the
      Emerson letter. That is what they will try to do, and my reply to Chadwick will make
      it harder than ever for them. When we get them fairly shut up on that point, we will
      proceed to further action.
   </p>
   
   <p>Meanwhile, be careful not to make any unguarded admissions,
      so as to call for defence We must
      not be detained on side issues. I burn to resume the thunder and let the levin fly
      at Marston. He need not think he is going to escape. At present I am only perplexed
      by the problem how to make the other side fight. So far, the affair is too much one
      way, and they seem
      
      
      cowed. O if you only had a publisher! What a chance for advertising is slipping
      by.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am anxious not to be dragged away from the main question into the discussion of
      side issues, and am therefore in doubt whether to reply to "Sigma." Of course, it
      is
      a fine chance for the catawampous
       
      chaw, as this bogus "experienced
      critic" will find out if I go for him, but it seems too much like being drawn away
      from the trail. On the other hand, The Tribune invites my attention to Sigma's
      "assertion" about the "disgusting Priapism," which is, of course, a disgusting lie,
      and I 
      
      I have to
      make up my mind whether the point is worth scoring. I have been talking today with
      Professor Loomis who was up at Concord when Emerson's letter was published, and
      heard him talk on the subject. He says Emerson's enthusiasm about the book was
      great,
      
      and that
      he never said a word, nor assumed any tone, pointing to any discount or
      qualification. Emerson's prominent consideration about Leaves of Grass was its absolute
      <u>newness</u>. He spoke of it as absolutely a new manifestation of literature—a fresh revelation.
      Professor Loomis is very
      
      strong about the impossibility of Emerson ever having gone back
      upon his letter. The tone he took, he says, precluded this. He says that undoubtedly
      Emerson was <u>subsequently</u> much annoyed at what the
      publication of the letter brought upon him—the swarm of "trippers and
       
      askers" that
      surrounded him with demands as to how he could defend such a passage as this, and
      what had he to say to such an expression as this, etc, etc., and that he may have
      expressed his annoyance, said petulant things, wished you more than once at the
      devil, etc.,
      
      but
      this was all, and that he never qualified his original utterance—never! This
      is Professor Loomis' view—a distinguished man, a witness—and it has
      weight and force at this time.
   </p>
   
   <p>Thoreau, he said, was equally, or nearly equally, strong in favor of Leaves of Grass,
      and so were the other
      
       Concordians. All this knocks the "disgusting Priapism" assertion
      endways. Of course we must expect all sorts of hardy lying, but we must allow
      nothing and demand proof of everything alleged.
   </p>
   
   <p>Another question is as to the genuineness of the Sigma letter. The 
      Tribune
      editorial shows a desire to put in something as a makeweight, and to seem biased
      against me, while admitting my letters and letting me do all the mischief I can, and
      Whitelaw Reid's notes to me have a cordial tone which sustains this view. Hence, the
      Sigma letter
      
       
      may
      be got up as a counterpoise. At any rate, it is let in in sham equity. If genuine,
      who wrote it? Sigma is the Greek letter S, which might stand for Spofford, the
      librarian of Congress, who is unfriendly to you, and a great squirt and jackass
      generally.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>I will decide soon whether to answer this serpentine signature.</p>
   
   <p>Apropos, Professor Loomis says he wrote to you for a copy of your book, which he is
      anxious to get. I wish you would let me know the price, as I have enquiries on this
      point, and can only suppose
      
      it is $2, like the Osgood.
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent John Burroughs one of yesterday's Tribunes, which I hope will reach him.</p>
   
   <p>The day here is bad for heat, and I sit soaked, after a sleepless night, not fit to
      write a letter nor anything else. Congratulatory epistles continue to flow. All taffy
      so far, except
      
      "Sigma," whose lucubrations make me think of dear old Gurowski's phrase of
      objurgation—"Sir, you are an asinine assish ass!" This is too mild, but
      nevertheless it faintly describes Sigma.
