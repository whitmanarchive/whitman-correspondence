   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are so sorry to hear you are so ill, &amp; we long to help you. You have done so
      much for us, your "Leaves of Grass" have been a real Bible to us, full of hope for
      our poor human race &amp; especially for the help you have given to our half of
      humanity,  namely the
      Women. It is about 3 years now since we found you, &amp; you have been a dear &amp;
      cherished friend [illegible]
       since,
      at first secretly because of the Jews but we can dare to speak now more freely of
      our prophet.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is so painful to us to hear of so dear a friend  being in trouble, we sh[illegible] like to go over &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">nurse?</span>]
       you, but we cannot,
      one of us is busy with professional engagements; &amp; the other can not leave her
      mother. We are sending this to your friend &amp; champion 
      Rosetti
      
      
       as we do
      not know your address. Dear Walt Whitman  pray accept the warmest sympathy from
      two grateful Scotch Women.
   </p>
