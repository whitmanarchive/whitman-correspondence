      St Clair river on a steamboat taking with us a sailboat, provisions &amp;c (fishing
      tackle of course). From Robert's landing (30 ms. below Sarnia) we sailed (in our
      small boat) some 20 ms. further down the Chanail Ecarté (a stream which puts
      out of the St Clair)—spent two days fishing and camping about the shores of
      Lake St Clair—we had a grand time, caught some black bass, perch, and a big
      pike and a rock bass. We sailed across Lake St Clair from Mitchell's Bay to Star
      Island Home (15 ms.) took steam-boat there and back to Sarnia Sunday
      evening—Home here Monday noon and found the Inspector waiting for
      me—hard at work since

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07304_n1">1. This letter is
      addressed: Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey U.S.A. It is
      postmarked: London | PM | MY 28 | 89 | Canada; C. D. [illegible] | 8[illegible]; Camden, N.J. | May | 30 | 6 AM | [illegible]9 | Rec'd.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Bucke of .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07304_n3">3. The cutting from <em>The Critic</em> is probably the notice of William Douglas
      O'Connor's death which appeared May 18, 1889. Horace Traubel had written an
      appreciation notice for <em>The Critic</em> but it was rejected.
      Instead, the journal printed one which Whitman called "weak enough to be
      namby-pamby" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.37.html">Tuesday, May 14, 1889</a> and <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.43.html">Monday, May 20, 1889</a>. Traubel's note on the envelope refers to <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.53.html">Thursday, May 30, 1889</a>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n4">5. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n3">6. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.07233_n2">7. Frederick William
      Kittermaster (?–1904) was a lawyer in Sarnia, Ontario; he married Louisa
      Helen Pardee (1865–1950), the daughter of the Canadian lawyer and
      politician Timothy Blair Pardee, in 1888.<a href="#r7">[back]
