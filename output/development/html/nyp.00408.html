      <br></br>Down at White Horse
      <br></br>At the Staffords'—
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Aug 3
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Herb
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I came down here yesterday afternoon in the 4½ train.<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> Mrs Stafford has been for over a week, &amp; yet is, quite ill—in bed most of the time—She
      lies in Deb's room—the one you used to occupy—She is pretty comfortable—is thinner,
      &amp; more brunette than ever—Keeps pretty cheery—Will get around I think this coming
      week—had a good night last night &amp; a fair forenoon to-day, (sitting up in the easy
      chair by the window) but is not quite so well this afternoon (it is now 3)—They have
      had no doctor so far—I think the <em>immediate</em> trouble is of stomach &amp; bowel nature, deeply seated—&amp; the general <em>basic</em> &amp; more or less remote trouble is being fearfully &amp; for a long time overwork'd in
      body &amp; worried in mind—Still, as I said, I think she will be about again in a few
      days<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—As at present, though a quite sick woman, nothing serious indicated—Debby<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has been home the past week, but is to go away to-night—Mr Stafford is well as usual—was
      up to the city with a load of straw yesterday.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Sunday forenoon Aug 4</p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this down by the pond, in the cool of the willows close by the gurgling
      brook—a hot walk down the lane &amp; across the big field, but the strong sun welcome
      to me, for all that—Here I sit (have hung my shirt on a bush to dry)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All here just as you used to see it—only more so—more luxuriant, un-trimm'd, bushy,
      weedy than ever—the locust (cicada) sounds firmly to-day here—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mrs S[tafford] down in the kitchen this morning—I rose early &amp; made the fire, &amp; assisted
      Ruthey<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> in getting the breakfast—We had a fine meal—I made the coffee &amp; (<em>of course</em>) it was good—No mail to-day &amp; I must wait to send this to-morrow—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>August 5th</p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this up in Harry's &amp; my room at K[irkwood]—Mrs S is much better to-day—She
      is about seeing to things somewhat as usual—(A great part of her illness is some peculiar
      trouble, or breakage or rupture to which <em>women</em> only are liable—in her case aggravated by overwork)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is a wet foggy forenoon—Debby went away with Jo Saturday night—George has gone
      up to the City with a load of sugar-corn—Harry has gone over to his work at the station—Ed
      to the store—Lizzie Hider<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> was over here Saturday afternoon &amp; evening—Bill Peak (epileptic), the miller's son
      at Tomlinson's, has been arrested for purloining a lot of Camden &amp; Atlantic RR tickets—Old
      Mr Morgan<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> has been dead six weeks—you knew that Mrs Lizzie Stafford (Ben's wife)<sup><a href="#nyp.00408_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> was dead &amp; buried—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Shall send this over by Harry to mail after dinner—Much obliged for the designs on
      the block—very nice—also the letter—both arriving safe—Give my best love to your mother—tell
      her I am well, &amp; shall branch off somewhere (I hardly know where) for the rest of
      the summer, &amp; will not forget to send some written or printed sign of my whereabout,
      if any chances—Her letter of a week since was rec'd just as I was starting out—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall go up either this afternoon or to-morrow.</p>
