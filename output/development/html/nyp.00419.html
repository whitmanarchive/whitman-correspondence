   <p>Yours of 21st 
      rec'd
      
       this forenoon, with slip from <em>Nation</em> (herewith
      enclosed, returned)—<em>I am glad you sent it me</em>, as I do
      not see the N.—The eye-works have resumed operations pretty nearly same as
      before—I see out of <em>both</em> now &amp; a great blessing in
      my imprisoned condition—A friend has sent me Stedman's book, &amp; I have
      looked it over<sup><a href="#nyp.00419_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—it seems to me a dissertation &amp;
      biographies on very grand themes &amp; persons by an amiable "clerk with a pen
      behind his ear"—as Warren Hastings or Macaulay, or Canning or Sheridan or
      somebody said—("By God, sir, if I am to have <em>a master</em>,
      don't let it be a mere clerk with a pen behind his ear")—I heard from John
      Burroughs ten days since—he was well &amp; every thing right—I hear from
      Dr Bucke pretty often—he is not well himself—(though not <em>down</em>)—&amp; there has been bad sickness in his family
      &amp; the hospital staff—his last letter 
      rec'd
      
       yesterday is dated at Sarnia,
      Canada<sup><a href="#nyp.00419_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am getting along comfortably—the weather has been bad as can be &amp; the
      traveling ditto, for three weeks past, my old nag has nearly given out too, &amp; I
      have not been out of the house—which tells on me—great torpor of the
      secretions—I am very clumsy &amp; can hardly get up or down stairs—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The English "offering" (through Rossetti and Herbert Gilchrist) will 
      am't
      
       to over
      $500—the principal part of which has been already sent me<sup><a href="#nyp.00419_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—&amp; on which I am really living this
      winter—write oftener—My last half-annual return of royalties for both my
      books just 
      rec'd
      
      —$20.71cts<sup><a href="#nyp.00419_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—the death of Mrs.
      Gilchrist has been a gloom to me, &amp; has affected me ever since—I am not
      sure but she had the finest &amp; perfectest nature I ever met—Glad to hear
      
      ab't
      
       the Channing's<sup><a href="#nyp.00419_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—Give them my love—I am
      scribbling in my little front room down stairs—the parrot has been squalling
      &amp; the canary singing—I write hardly at all—
