      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter, which Mr Rossetti forwarded to me, took me by surprise, and gave me pain
      also. I had just returned to the above address after a twelve-months absence, during
      which I had married and buried a gifted and beautiful young wife, and such a letter
      from you did not tend to solace the pain of my bereavement.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I gave my employé at the <u>Secularist</u> office the sum of £3 to procure a P.O.O. which I instructed him to forward to you.
      He was also to see that the books were sent to their proper destinations as soon as
      received, as I was much away from home. The £3 included about £1 from myself, the
      subscriptions mentioned in your
      
      letter being almost all I received from others.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had some difficulty in finding the address of the gentleman who subscribed a guinea,
      but having done so, I find that he never received his copy of the "Leaves of Grass"
      although strangely enough he never made any complaint about it. My employé, then,
      must have cheated me. I discovered that he drank and neglected the business, and had
      to discharge him, and soon after to drop the paper too; but I did not suspect him
      in pecuniary matters. Where he is now I don't know.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course I hold myself responsible, and in a week or two I will send a remittance
      with a list of the subscribers. I would have done this at once on receiving your letter,
      but my wife's illness and death were so costly and so unspeakably painful, that I
      was impoverished in pocket and broken down in health. I wrote you a letter at Christmas,
      when I expected some money, but the money was not forthcoming and so the letter was
      not sent.
   </p>

      Yours truly
