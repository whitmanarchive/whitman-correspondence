      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received your welcome letter on the 31,<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r1">1</a></sup> was glad to get it, I received one from H Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> the same day, he wishes me to come up to his house and go out to the theatre with
      him on Saturday, but I will not get to go, if I could go anywhere I would come up
      to see you, but I will have to put it off until next Saturday week, I think, I want
      to come up and see you so bad but cannot. I did not get my load of cabbage
      
      
      
      sold, had to leave them with a commissioner, over in the city, I got all wet and cought cold, and have not been well since, have had the head ache all the time. It is raining
      very hard there, and when I went out to get the paper to write to you I got all wet
      and got the paper wet also, you must excuse the paper. I wrote a letter Jo, to-day.
      I have not heard from him for a long time, I think that I wrote the last letter to
      him, but perhaps he did not get it, for I put it in a Telegraphic envelope
      
      
      
      and perhaps he has not received it. I am still with B K Sharp,<sup><a href="#n1041" id="r3">3</a></sup> him and I had a row one day last week, he came in as he always does [
      <span class="unclear">with?</span>]
       some of his fooling and I gave him back as good as he sent and he got on his ear
      about it and toled me if things did not suit me here I was free to leave at any time, then I cursed
      him and went out of the office and went over to the Narrow Gauge and found a job,
      but when I came back to tell him he made up with me, and I
      
      
      
      the same with him, so I did not go.
   </p>
   
   <p>The folkes are all well I ballieve, and I feel better than I have for the past 3 days, but not as well as I did before
      I went to market. I hear that: Elmer<sup><a href="#n0858" id="r4">4</a></sup> was over to see you 2 times and you and him went over to Mrs. Gilchrist's<sup><a href="#n0259" id="r5">5</a></sup> to spend the evening, hope you had a good time. I must close.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0262">2. Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist
      (1857–1914), son of Alexander and Anne Gilchrist, was an English painter
      and editor of <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and Writings</em>
      (London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1887). For more information, see Marion Walker Alcaro,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_87.html">Gilchrist, Herbert Harlakenden (1857–1914)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1041">3. B.K. Sharp was Harry's employer,
      according to Edwin Haviland Miller (see "Introduction," <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1964],
      3:6).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0858">4. Elmer E. Stafford (1861–1957)
      was Harry Stafford's cousin (see <em>Daybooks and Notebooks</em>,
      ed. William White [New York: New York University Press, 1978], 1:76
      n232).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0259">5. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
