   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00478_n1">1. This post card is
      endorsed: "Answ'd Feb 24/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving
      Service | Treasury | Washington | D C. It is postmarked: Philadelphia | Pa. |
      Feb 23 83 | 6 30 PM; Washington, Recd. | Feb | 24 | 4 30 AM | 1883 | 2. The date
      of this post card, obviously sent later than the preceding one, is established
      by O'Connor's endorsement, the postmark, and the reference to O'Connor's
      manuscript. In his reprint of <em>The Good Gray Poet</em> Richard
      Maurice Bucke included a reference to Richard Henry Stoddard's review of the
      pamphlet in <em>The Round Table</em> on January 20, 1866, and
      printed a letter written to the magazine by Charles Lanman and O'Connor's reply
      (130–132).<a href="#r1">[back]
