      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Well here I sit this forenoon in a corner by the window in Major Hapgood's office—all
      the Potomac &amp; Maryland &amp; Virginia hills in sight—writing my Tuesday letter to you,
      dearest mother—Major has gone home to Boston on sick leave, &amp; only the clerk &amp; me
      occupy the office &amp; he not much of the time—at the present moment there are two wounded
      officers come in to get their pay, one has crutches—the other is drest in the light blue uniform of the invalid corps—way up here in the 5th floor it is
      pretty hard scratching for cripples &amp; very weak men to journey up here—often they
      come up here very weary &amp; faint, &amp; then find out they can't get their money, some
      red tape hitch, &amp; the poor soldiers look so disappointed—it always makes me feel bad—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, we are having perfect weather here nowadays, both night &amp; day—the nights are
      wonderful, for the last three nights as I have walked home from the hospital pretty
      late, it has seemed to me like a dream, the moon &amp; sky ahead of any thing I ever see
      before—Mother, do you hear any thing from George, I wrote to him yesterday &amp; sent
      him your last letter &amp; Jeff's enclosed—I shall send him some papers to-day—I send
      papers quite often—(why hasn't Jeff sent me the Union<sup><a href="#loc.00791_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> with my letter in—I want much to see it, &amp; whether they have misprinted it.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I dont think the 51st has been in any of the fighting we know of down there yet—what is
      to come of course nobody can tell—As to Burnside I suppose you know he is among his <em>friends</em>, &amp; I think this quite important, for such the main body of East Tennesseans are,
      &amp; are far truer Americans any how than the Copperheads of the North—the Tennesseans
      will fight for us too—Mother, you have no idea how the soldiers, sick &amp;c. (I mean
      the American ones to a man) all feel about the copperheads, they never speak of them
      without a curse &amp; I hear them say with an air that shows they mean it, they would
      shoot them sooner than they would a rebel—Mother, the troops from Meade's army are
      passing through here night &amp; day, going west &amp; so down to reinforce Rosecrans I suppose—the
      papers are not permitted to mention it, but it is so—two Army Corps I should think
      have mostly passed—they go through night &amp; day—I hear the whistle of the locomotive
      screaming away any time at night when I wake up, &amp; the rumbling of the trains—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, you must write to me soon, &amp; so must Jeff—I thought Mat was going to
      send me a great long letter, I am always looking for it, I hope it will be full of
      every thing about family matters &amp; doings, &amp; how every body really is—I go to Major's
      box three or four times a day—I want to hear also about Andrew, &amp; indeed about every
      one of you &amp; every thing, nothing is too trifling, nothing uninteresting.
   </p>
   
   <p>O mother, who do you think I got a letter from, two or three days ago—Aunt Fanny,
      Ansel's mother—She sent it by a young man, a wounded soldier who has been home to
      Farmingdale on furlough, &amp; lately returned—she writes a first rate letter, Quaker
      all over<sup><a href="#loc.00791_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I shall answer it—She says Mary &amp; Ansel &amp; all are well—I have rec'd another letter
      from Mrs Price, she has not good health, I am sorry for her from my heart, she is
      a good noble woman, no better kind—Mother, I am in the hospitals as usual—I stand
      it better the last three weeks than ever before—I go among the worst fevers &amp; wounds
      with impunity—I go among the small pox, &amp;c just the same—I feel to go without apprehension,
      &amp; so I go—nobody else goes, &amp; as the darkey said there at Charleston when the boat
      run on a flat &amp; the reb sharpshooters were peppering them, <em>somebody must jump in de water</em> (&amp; shove the boat off)—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00791_n1">1. In the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em> of September 22 appeared Whitman's communication
      "From Washington," which is adequately described by its subheadings: "Waiting
      and Speculating," "The Weather—The President," "Signs of Next Session," "The
      Wounded in the Hospitals," "The Army Young and American," "Benjamin D. Howell,
      Company D, 87th New York, Aged 18," and "Fifty-first New York Volunteers." It is
      reprinted in Emory Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected Poetry and
         Prose of Walt Whitman</em> (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page and
      Company, 1921), 2:26–29.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00791_n2">2. Fanny Van Nostrand,
      Mary's mother-in-law, wrote to Whitman from Farmingdale, Long Island, on
      September 25: "I have raiced my pen unexpectedly to address thee with a few
      lines thinking thee will be pleased to hear from us as thee was so kind to let
      us know thee had not foregotton us in our old age, we wos very pleased with them
      few lines thee favord us with…I have roat more than I expected to with asking
      thee to over look and excuse all blunders and mistaks, thee must consider that
      it is from and old woman and vary laim" (The Library of Congress). Whitman's
      letter is apparently lost. Mrs. Van Nostrand's letter was evidently delivered by
      the soldier Hendrickson mentioned in a letter from 
      .<a href="#r2">[back]
