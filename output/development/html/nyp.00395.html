      sooner I have been laid up with a pain in my back ever since tuesday last, but I am
      feeling better at this present time &amp; hope to [be] able to go work tomorrow [morn]ing.
      I cant find words to tell you how thankful I am for the Picture. I dont think that I ever had a present that I think more of than I do it. I am agoing to
      have it framed if nothing happens&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I want that Picture to remain in my family as long as thier is a member of it living. I would like very much to see you &amp; have a long talk with
      you &amp; if nothing happens I want you to visit us soon as the Weather gets pleasanter.
      We are as comfortable as the most of poor people that has to labor for a living. this
      is a very plaesent place in the summer time when the trees are all out in full bearing.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William H. Millis Jr. was the son of William H.
      Millis Sr., who corresponded with Whitman during the war about the condition of
      his wounded son (see Millis Sr.'s 
      letter to Whitman). Whitman described Millis Jr., upon first meeting: "Wm H
      Millis co E 8th Penn Cav. Gen Gregg's old reg. Bridgeville Sussex co Del bed 33
      Ward B May 8th '64 / g s w in Chestâ€”w in left arm father living in Bridgeville
      Del" (<em>NUPM</em> 2:728). Millis Jr. first wrote to Whitman on
      , thanking him for his letter
      (not extant) and proclaiming, "May god bless you forever I cant find words to
      tell you the love thier is in me for you. I hope you &amp; I may live to meet
      again on this earth if not I hope we shall meet in the world w[h]ere there is no
      more parting."
