      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your card just rec'd—I am still badly under the weather—spells of prostration like those of two years
      ago—&amp; now for more than a week the restless wretched <u>nights</u> of the rheumatic—Still a good heart &amp; not only a hope <u>but confidence</u> having pass'd through worse spells several times—that I shall get round soon &amp; be
      the same as before ill—I am up, &amp; feeling quite jolly this evening—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><u>Instead of 15th of April I think it would be safer to fix the lecture night, any where
         between the 10th &amp; 20th May</u>—If you &amp; the rest feel to, go on that 
      
      
      understanding, <u>as a settled thing</u>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>What is Benton's address in N Y?—If convenient, I should like to see the list of names, &amp; the draft of the letter,
      before formally put out—if you think well of this, either send me the list, or <u>tell Benton to send it me forthwith</u>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Beatrice Gilchrist is over here with us this evening—the G's break camp here in three
      or four weeks—spend the ensuing year excursively in America<sup><a href="#uva.00376_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Write me the moves—I shall be home here all the time—Every thing (p o, or telegram)
      comes here, (431 Stevens Street Camden N.J.) as unerringly as fate, &amp; very promptly<sup><a href="#uva.00376_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00376_n1">1. The envelope for this letter
      bears the address: John Burroughs | Esopus-on-Hudson | New York. It is
      postmarked: Camden | Mar | 29 | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00376_n2">2. On May 1, Anne Gilchrist
      informed Burroughs that they were in Northampton, Massachusetts, and mentioned
      her sorrow in leaving Philadelphia: "We had planted our tent so firmly and
      spread our possessions around us so, at 1929. However it stands empty and
      forlorn now" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      145). This description of her former home undoubtedly characterized her own
      emotional state after an association with Whitman for eighteen months during
      which she had learned, how painfully she never divulged in her correspondence,
      the impossibility of establishing a physical relationship with the poet.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00376_n3">3. Burroughs came to Camden
      to see Whitman on April 1 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r3">[back]
