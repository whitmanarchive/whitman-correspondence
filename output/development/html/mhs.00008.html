      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sister Lou
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All goes satisfactory here—I keep as well as usual—have a very good room
      &amp; board in a kind of half hotel half boarding house, the <u>hotel Waterston</u>—the landlady Mrs Moffit,<sup><a href="#mhs.00008_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> has a hundred
      guests when full, mostly families, very nice—capital table, (most too good for
      me, tempts me too much)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My book is getting on swimmingly—I have got it (after considerable worrying
      &amp; doing &amp; undoing) into a shape that suits me first-rate, and this
      printing office is putting it into typographical shape too that satisfies me
      well—nearly 100 pages already set up &amp; cast—so you see that's
      working all right—I am mostly 
      
      here at the printing office, five or six hours
      every day, reading proof &amp; seeing to things<sup><a href="#mhs.00008_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Mr
      Osgood the publisher &amp; Rand &amp; Avery the printers are very friendly indeed, I
      couldn't have better ones to deal with. I suppose you get the papers I
      send—the Boston <u>Globe</u> of four or five days ago<sup><a href="#mhs.00008_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—&amp; others—I get my letters very well
      here, sent on from Camden—Lou I send a small package directed to you by mail,
      please put it up on my table—Shall send occasionally same way, to be put
      up there &amp; kept for me—I go out riding now &amp; then, am to go for a
      couple of hours this evening—havn't got anything from you since (I believe)
      Monday last.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Address me either <u>here</u> (see outside of this
      envelope)—or care Osgood &amp; Co: 211 Tremont Street—Of course the
      greatest anxiety about the President<sup><a href="#mhs.00008_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—thought here
      to-day there is no hope—it is terrible—

   <p id="mhs.00008_n1">1. Whitman paid $8 a
      week for his board to Eva E. Moffit. On September 30 Whitman paid Mrs. Moffit
      $41.44 "for six weeks, up to date" and $21 on October 19 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00008_n2">2. On August 22 Whitman
      spent the morning at the printing office: "the superintendent Mr [Henry H.]
      Clark very kind &amp; thoughtful—appears as though I was going to have
      things all my own way—I have a table &amp; nook, in part [of] a little
      room, all to myself, to read proof, write, &amp;c." In an inclusive entry, "Aug
      20 to 30," Whitman noted: "the book well under way—I am at the printing
      office some hours every day." On September 1 Whitman sent Dr. Richard Maurice
      Bucke "proofs up to page 143" and on September 4 "proofs to 
      p
      
       176" (Whitman's Commonplace Book). See also Clifton Joseph Furness,
      <em>Walt Whitman's Workshop</em> (Cambridge: Harvard
      University Press, 1928), 263–265.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="mhs.00008_n3">3. A lengthy interview with
      Whitman, entitled "The Good Gray Poet," appeared in the Boston <em>Globe</em> on August 24, in which the poet discussed the architectural
      structure of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>; averred that "the large
      magazines are still shy of me," citing a recent rejection by <em>Harper's Monthly</em> ("A Summer's Invocation"; see the letter from Whitman
      to Harry Stafford of ); praised
      Emerson as the most important American poet and termed Tennyson "in every
      respect the poet of our times."<a href="#r3">[back]

      lingered in a critical condition until September 19.<a href="#r4">[back]
