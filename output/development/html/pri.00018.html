      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have already acknowledged yours of 16th<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Mine of 17th will have advised you of the situation here, &amp; the general character 
      of my wishes, the way things have shaped themselves in London—Whatever I should do,
      if I had the planning 
      of it <u>de novo</u>, the question is now (like a general making the best of the turn the battle has taken
      in its 
      own hands, &amp; compell'd to decide quickly &amp; definitely,) what to direct &amp; authorize under the circumstances—While
      I unhesitatingly accept such kind offerings as Chas W Reynell's<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n4" id="r2">2</a></sup> (No 1. in your transcript) and J Leicester Warren<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n12" id="r3">3</a></sup> (No 2)—&amp; authorize you or any of my friends to continue to accept the like, in my
      name, where offer'd 
      readily &amp; properly, I'd rather you would, after receiving this, either, (to use nautical
      lingo,) <u>take in sail</u>, 
      or at least don't crowd on any more sail at all. The whole business requires to be
      done with perfect candor 
      to my generous friends—to you &amp; the other mediums of that generosity—&amp; to myself—&amp;
      must &amp; shall be so done. 
      Of the cheque (No 1) or any other, or any thing of the kind sent by you or through
      you or any of my friends, 
      the most convenient to me would be to have them remitted to me, to my address here,
      drawn on some well-known 
      New York or Philadelphia banker, <u>payable to my order</u>—(if in Philadelphia, on Drexel &amp; Co. bankers, 
      34 south 3d street.)<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n13" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      Then the p.o. international money order is also a good &amp; safe way to remit—I should
      like in all cases to have the full &amp; explicit address of the friend &amp; giver, to send
      him or her 
      at least one special autograph copy, or set, of my books—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As told you in former letter,<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> although I am indeed poor, with means exhausted, I am by no means 
      in a condition of pinching want, nor likely to be. I am boarding here, under the usual,
      unavoidable expenses. 
      I accept the kind gifts, first for my own help, then perhaps somewhat for the still
      graver needs of others, 
      forever falling in my way. For the future I really think the income from my books,
      if it can be utilized, 
      promises amply enough for my support—&amp; <u>that</u> decidedly would be most satisfactory to me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—Probably from the tinge of Quaker breed in me the inner convictions &amp; silent dictates
      of <u>the spirit</u> 
      settle these cases, &amp; what I must do in them, more than reason, convention or even
      delicacy—&amp; those inner dictates 
      I have now obeyed in the decisions of this letter, as <u>a higher reason &amp; delicacy</u>, 
      &amp; the final arbiter of the question.

   <p>If perfectly convenient I should like Buchanan to see this letter—also Dowden—Indeed
      you can make what use of it, in your discretion, you think best—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A line further about the publication copy, Two Volumes, I sent a couple of days since.<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> I couldn't rest until I had sent that copy to provide for any thing that might happen
      (my affairs are 
      in such a chaotic state here in America—my health, mentality, from week to week, even
      <u>existence</u>, uncertain)—Now you have it, I feel relieved, &amp; shall consider that the thing is
      secured, &amp; cannot be lost—<u>But there is no haste about it</u>—If you should hear of any proposed London reprint, then try &amp; get my copy 
      published at once, making any decent terms you can—But if there don't appear to be
      any danger, take your leisure, 
      &amp; hold on. See if you can get any one to pay me something down ahead—I revoke what
      I 
      
      said about the <u>shilling edition</u><sup><a href="#pri.00018_n14" id="r7">7</a></sup>—let the books, when printed, be at a price suitable to the trade &amp; market—

   <p>There is a precious row here over <u>your</u> row in London—all the curs &amp; kennels of literary New York and Boston 
      are in full chorus after you fellows—after Buchanan especially—then you, Dowden, 
      &amp; the rest—(of course <u>I</u> catch it roundly)<sup><a href="#pri.00018_n5" id="r8">8</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
