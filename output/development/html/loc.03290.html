   </p>
   
   <p> I am very, very sorry to learn that your physical condition is so low and that it
      prevents you from doing much work. What I want to know is whether, if I send a
      stenographer over to you, he could do your work, that is to say, could you dictate
      with perfect ease the article on Lincoln and such other articles as you may have
      intended for the North American Review, or any other of Mr. Rice's<sup><a href="#loc.02206_n4" id="r1">1</a></sup> literary enterprises. I think I can manage to give you
      this help if you could utilize it.<sup><a href="#loc.03290_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very truly yours,
      <br></br>Jas Redpath
      <br></br>
      <br></br>Walt Whitman, Esq.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
