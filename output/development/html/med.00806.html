   <p>Had for dinner stewed blackberries—a favorite tipple of mine—and boiled
      rice. . . . Sidney Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r2">2</a></sup> has made a second big head—an
      improvement, if I dare say so, on the first. The second is the modern spirit, awake
      &amp; alert as well as calm—contrasted with the antique &amp; Egyptian
      calmness &amp; rest of the first. We have decided on the second.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy and Richard
      Maurice Bucke were two of Whitman's closest friends and admirers. Kennedy
      (1850–1929) first met Whitman while on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> in 1880. He became a fierce defender of Whitman
      and would go on to write a book-length study of the poet. For more about
      Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Bucke (1837–1902), a Canadian physician,
      was Whitman's first biographer, and would later become one of his medical
      advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of Bucke and
      Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
