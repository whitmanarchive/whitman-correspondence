   <p>As you might possibly have room in the paper—&amp; a full report <u>might</u> hit—I send you a complete copy of my lecture, to take the chances <u>for to-morrow's paper</u>—(As I calculate, it would make about three quarters of a column in your small type)<sup><a href="#med.00631_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—My plan is to break the tedium of my half invalidism from time to time (&amp; also collect
      a few shekels) by getting engagements as a lecturer &amp; reader,—&amp; this is an attempt
      to break the ice.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00631_n2">1. The two-column report of
      Whitman's address—"A Poet on the Platform"—in the New York <em>Tribune</em> on April 15, began: "The poet Walt Whitman made
      his beginning as a lecturer last night at Steck Hall, in Fourteenth-st. His
      subject was the death of President Lincoln. He reads from notes, sitting in a
      chair, as he is still much disabled from paralysis. He desires engagements as a
      reader of his own poems and as a lecturer."<a href="#r1">[back]
