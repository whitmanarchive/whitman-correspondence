   </p>
   
   
   <p>I<sup><a href="#n0196" id="r1">1</a></sup> have mailed you and registered there, the following Books and
      printed matter. a Copy of "the Bhagavad Gita"<sup><a href="#n0079" id="r2">2</a></sup> Thompson's
      translations, (a recent Edition.) Selections from the 
      Sanscrit
      
       by John Muir<sup><a href="#n0425" id="r3">3</a></sup> D.D. a lecture on English Literature by a Unitarian Minister
      of Birkenhead (to whom I gave a copy of the Complete Edition of your Poems) lastly
      the Supplement to our town's paper. I would like you to look over a Sketch by H.C.
      Andersen on [
      <span class="unclear">two?</span>]
       Candles,
      its translated by one of your readers here. the other is a Story from Iceland being
      the first story in said paper, it is also written by a warm friend of yours, he was
      once Editor of the paper but is now engaged in a larger paper in a neighbouring
      town, a paper that is quite in advance of all our papers here about entitled the
      Newcastle Chronicle it has got a Daily as well as weekly issue. I will send you a
      copy someday of the weekly one so that you may gauge its power and its principles
      and also  contrast it
      with your own papers for I think there is large room for improvement in—many
      of them I see. they seem to contain matters of such trivial interest outside of the
      district they are issued in. now I think your papers ought as a rule to be universal
      in a 
      lare
      
       portion of their there topics. if your
      National poetry to a large extent is intensely European, I think the papers to large
      extent are essentially <u>local</u> in 
      there
      
       articles, at least with very few exceptions such I find is the case in
      those I 
      recieve
      
      . the best piece of [
      <span class="unclear">hopeful?</span>]
       outspoken utterance in print I see is the reports of the Free
      [
      <span class="unclear">Religious?</span>]
      
      Association of Boston. It seems quite in Keeping with what
      supposes and expects from the 
      cultureed
      
       people of your land—but perhaps you 
      dont
      
       see it? so that my reference to it will not be of use to you I help all I
      can here its circulation. Well I hope you will enjoy our little gift I hope in the
      perusal of such work you will something akin to the width and depth of your own
      heart. these are old utterances, yet new to us in  this lands. "the Gita" is one of my
      favourite Books it is the <u>gem</u> of all Indian love. it is as
      <u>wide</u> in its teachings and [
      <span class="unclear">has?</span>]
       deep too as anything I have ever yet seen in
      printed Book. I have tried hard to induce a <u>few souls</u> to
      aid in the issue of a cheap universal Edition of it, but have utterly failed. its
      present publisher been lead to do it, in the hopes it may lead to some such
      recognition by some of our Literary associations—I read with deepfelt sympathy
      the slight utterances a 
      E.A. Poe
      
       He and his Works have long been in part dear to me.—but what is it
      that is not so. and to Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r4">4</a></sup> and my own nature too and lastly
      to you and your teachings. how can one but feel interested and moved by such a
      Nature and then I ask? How [
      <span class="unclear">comes?</span>]
       the distance in such life as [
      <span class="unclear">over?</span>]
      
       such Souls? <u>We</u>
      <u>We</u> poor mortals sit in judgement on such—who know
      nothing of the nature or the environments of such. I pause in my thoughts on all
      such, and gaze on them in wonderment—even with aw and silence too.—
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>How much of the Speculations of our time did he not solve, and lies therein 
      embeded
      
      in these wild wild awful stories of his. Ah! that nature is one that used
      one's love and deepest sympathy, not our <u>hate</u> and <u>Scorn</u>, as alas too often is given it. your sketch of him
      in the Storm tossed vessel is very very awful real and true. it made me tremble
      while I read it.—and I have read it up to friends 3 times who call in to hear
      the news. 
      bye
      
       the way in the photograph you sent me with your Beaver [
      <span class="unclear">on?</span>]
       procurable yet? If so
      where and what price? The friend whose letter I sent you on your Critique on Burns
      who lives in London wants a copy. he has seen the one you sent me in 1869. Now
      lastly I feel glad to see in our papers you have seen [
      <span class="unclear">Conway?</span>]
      <sup><a href="#n0170" id="r5">5</a></sup> again. I once spent
      a little time pleasantly with him in London in 1873. He's a right noble free spoken
      man, full of wise helpful energy of all sorts in his neighborhood in London. I
      regretted his notes on you was so very brief. Will my subscription to your new
      Edition of your works, if sent you direct to America, be of any real aid in your new
      effort? let me know I will
