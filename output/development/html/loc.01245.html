      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It's good to get your letter of Nov 2<u>nd</u> forwarded to me
      here. Too bad my not acknowledging your books—they arrived all right sometime
      in Sept<u>r</u> and I forwarded one copy to the Fords.<sup><a href="#loc.01238_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I like the edition—it has a good monumental
      character about it. Your writing (in this last letter) looks as if you were well as
      ever, but I expect you vary—and sometimes pretty bad I fear, though never
      quite beaten. It is strange what a long time of suffering you have had in later
      life—you who were so healthy when young.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have come out here, dear Walt, to spend the winter, partly or chiefly in order to
      get at first hand the results of the Eastern thought + tradition in matters relating
      to religion—and the result is very interesting. I am staying just now with my
      friend Arunáchalam whose name you may remember. He has been very much pulled in
      this direction lately—and his Guru or Teacher is also here. This people has an
      extraordinary genius for religion and the force with which they abstract themselves
      from the world in their endeavor towards union with the universal consciousness is
      something remarkable—+ such as we have little idea of in the West. That a
      certain few attain this union, and with it unusual powers, is quite
      evident—and in attaining it they cast off all the bonds of caste + ceremonial + become
      free; so that one finds here behind the outer religion of the people a hidden few
      who are perfectly democratic and whose watchwords are Freedom Equality +
      Joy—and this has been the esoteric teaching of the Vedas + Upanishads for now
      thousands of years.
   </p>
   
   <p>The main method of attaining this union or emancipation is the suppression of <u>Thought</u> [which of course is abundantly indicated in yr L.
      of G.—tho' I don't know that it is actually formulated there]. When Thought is
      gone you are one piece with the universe, + by suppression you attain mastery and
      so
      can use thought or not use it, as you like.
   </p>
   
   <p>In the systematising and realising of these ideas these fellows here seem to have
      far
      outstripped us. On the other hand I think they are wanting in the part of Love.
      The word does not attract them—they do not <u>care</u> for
      others. They are gentle + kind, but glad after all to forget the world + everbody
      in
      contemplation of the divine being. Here I feel I cannot quite go with
      them—there is something cold + abstract in the business!
   </p>
   
   <p>However it is possible that in the union of the East + West both sides will be more
      perfectly represented + balanced in the future than they have ever been before.
      Wonderful isn't it? how these things have been known + worked out for ages.
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my love to Dr Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> if you write or see him—not
      forgetting H. Stafford,<sup><a href="#n0590" id="r3">3</a></sup> and with much love to yourself dear
      Walt + many remembrances + good hopes of rendezvous sometime or other
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Carpenter (1844–1929) was an English
      writer and Whitman disciple. Like many other young disillusioned Englishmen, he
      deemed Whitman a prophetic spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of
      brotherhood. Carpenter—a socialist philosopher who in his book <em>Civilisation, Its Cause and Cure</em> posited civilization as
      a "disease" with a lifespan of approximately one thousand years before human
      society cured itself—became an advocate for same-sex love and a
      contributing early founder of Britain's Labour Party. On , he wrote for the first time to Whitman: "Because you
      have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I thank you continually
      in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed of the noblest
      instinct of their nature" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [1906–1996], 1:160). For further discussion of
      Carpenter, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_12.html">Carpenter, Edward [1844–1929]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01238_n2">1. Isabella Ford
      (1855–1924) was an English feminist, socialist, and writer. Elizabeth
      (Bessie) Ford was her sister. Both were introduced to Whitman's writings by
      Edward Carpenter and they quickly became admirers of the aged poet.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0590">3. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
