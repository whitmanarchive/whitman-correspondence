      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had such hard work for the last six weeks that I have hardly had time to answer
      the regular business letters but to day thought I would "drop you a line" at any rate—
   </p>
   
   <p>Just now I am having rather a bad time in keeping up the water—so large a portion
      of the people let the water run to prevent freezing of the pipes—and our city—being
      so hilly that I cannot keep the water on the high points—still unless we have more
      than another week of this extremely cold weather we shall get through all right.<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>We talk of you often and wonder how you get on if you have anything like as bad a
      winter as we have &nbsp;I hope you take it easy and get on without much trouble. I have
      not been able to get out as much this season as usual—we have had the cold so long
      and so bad that I was forced to keep in doors to a great extent.
   </p>
   
   <p>I saw by yesterday's paper that Kingsley,<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of Brooklyn, had given up—poor fellow, all his keen striving and jobbing and talk
      is over forever &nbsp;He would have been happier, I think had he remained more like he
      was when he first came to Brooklyn.
   </p>
   
   <p>I mail you to-day a little picture of a new stand pipe tower that I am going to build
      this next year<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—we have let the work and shall commence on it as soon as the weather will let us.
      The design has been cut and changed—and re-made, till I got it to look as I thought
      it ought. The young man that made it has good taste and I think when finished it will
      look as well as anything of the kind in the country. The total cost will be about
      eighty thousand dollars complete. Let me know Walt how it looks to you please—All
      the lower part is to be of granite—and above that brick work—of the best bricks and
      workmanship. There will be nothing particularly grand about it except its proportions—That
      is I hav'nt attempted to make any wonderfully fine carving or anything of that kind. I shall
      be terribly disappointed if it fails to look well when built as I have carried out
      several things in opposition to the opinions of fellows who have the reputation of
      knowing all about such things—Well in a year from now, if we all live, we will know
      how it will be
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt, if you have a copy of your "Author's Edition" of your book that you can send
      me I would esteem it a great favor if you will write in it "A. J. Chaphe,<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> from the Author" and send it to me. Chaphe intends to get all your books as soon
      as he can get a little money ahead—but I would like to give him this one &nbsp;He has read
      all my copies—and is interested in them to a great extent.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hat and Jess keep pretty well and we all get on in the regular old way</p>
   
   
   <p>A few weeks ago Willard Arnold<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> called at my office—he was in St Louis a week—with one of the dramatic Companies
      &nbsp;I saw him often—did'nt go to the play but had him down to the house. Willard is in many respects the same
      as when a boy—he asked all about you—and well remembered many of the walks we all
      used to take on Sundays years and years ago.
   </p>
   
   <p>A few days ago I had a letter from Bill De Voe,<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> who is now located at Springfield, this state. Bill sent me a young mocking bird—his
      home is at a small town on the red-river in La. but he is running a surveyor's offices
      at Springfield
   </p>
   
   <p>I dont know whether I shall be able to get East this spring or not but I intend to make
      the effort. I feel the need of a vacation badly. I note what a terrible disaster you
      had in Philadelphia a few days since<sup><a href="#loc.00478_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—in some way it seemed to me the most heart rending of anything of the kind I ever
      read about. I suppose because it was a family dwelling perhaps. All send love to you
      dear Walt.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00478_n1">1. Jeff had been concerned
      with the recurring problem of water waste since 1876. From January 8 to 13,
      1884, the city suffered a five-day water shortage because of open faucets. To
      stop the practice, Jeff instituted house-to-house inspections and advocated
      universal metering.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00478_n2">2. See the letter from
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walt Whitman of . William C. Kingsley died in Brooklyn on February 21. He had
      worked with Jeff in Brooklyn, and later, in partnership with Colonel Abner C.
      Keeney, supervised the construction of the East River or Brooklyn Bridge. This
      engineering feat required fourteen years of work (1869-83) and was completed
      only after some loss of life, much political bickering, and enormous
      expenditures of capital and labor. Jeff echoes the popular view that this
      project exhausted Kingsley and perhaps destroyed him.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00478_n3">3. Standpipe No. 2, the
      "Red Tower" at Blair and Bissell streets, was authorized by the city council on
      June 10, 1884. Construction began in June 1885 and was substantially completed
      by March 1886. Jeff probably refers to a drawing of the water tower by its
      designer, William S. Eames, at that time deputy commissioner of public
      buildings.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00478_n4">4. Andrew J. Chaphe was
      the chief engineer of the pumping department at the St. Louis Water Works. Twice
      Jeff singled him out for praise in the official reports to the Board of Water
      Commissioners (1875 and 1876).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00478_n5">5. Unidentified.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00478_n6">6. See the letter from
      Thomas Jefferson Whitman to Walter Whitman, Sr., Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
      George Washington Whitman, Andrew Jackson Whitman, Hannah Louisa Whitman, and
      Edward Whitman of <a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00478_n7">7. The <em>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</em> carried the following headline on February 21:
      "<em>An entire Philadelphia family perishes in a burning
         dwelling</em>." The fire began in the home of John A. King, 1539 Pine
      Street, and eventually destroyed three houses and killed five people, including
      a nine-year-old boy.<a href="#r7">[back]
