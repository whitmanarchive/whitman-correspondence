      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send the MS<sup><a href="#col.00006_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> to-day by Adams Express. Return at my expense by ditto. 
   </p>
   
   <p>Take yr time. I am dissatisfied with the thing.—as I always am with any work when
      done. But in this case I feel particularly blue—after all my
      rooster-crowing—for anything put beside 
      yr
      
       writing dwindles immediately. The MS. is not <u>done</u>, &amp; never would be: I have simply suspended work. I 
      cd
      
       write forever on L. of G. because its scope is infinite. Have made the
      acquaintance of Sidney Morse.<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r3">3</a></sup> Good talks with him. He is going to <u>bust</u> you again in the Autumn! A <u>good
         fellow</u>!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
