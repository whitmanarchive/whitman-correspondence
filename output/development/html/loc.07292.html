   <p>A warm (almost hot) day—sun shining like June—birds singing all about the
      grounds—have been for a short drive and am going again soon for another and to
      post this.
   </p>  
   
   <p>I have looked up the Sarrazin<sup><a href="#n3115" id="r1">1</a></sup> article and I find (as
      expected) that Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> is quite right. S. says that "Hegel is
      (according to W.W.) the greatest of the philosophers."<sup><a href="#loc.07292_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup></p> 
   
   <p>I have been looking up the "Encyclopédie" question and I find it a bigger one
      than I expected. There have been many "Encyclopédies" pub<u>d</u> in France in the last 200 years and they are hard to untangle one from
      the other. However here are a few facts: 1, The great, celebrated, "Encyc'." edited
      by Diderot<sup><a href="#loc.07292_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> was in <u>21 Vol</u>. It was pub<u>d</u> from July 1751 to 1765. 2, The big "Encyc." called "Encyclopédie
      Méthodique ou par ordre de matiéres" was edited by C.J. Panckoucke,<sup><a href="#loc.07292_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> then
      by H. Agasse, then by the widow of the latter and was published—first vol. in Nov.
      1782—and the last in 1832 (just 50 years coming out). The text (letter press)
      of the book was in 166½ (I think 4<u>to</u> vols, and the
      plates in 51 parts, equal probably to 25½ vols—making 192 vols
      altogether. Your line (p. 120 "N.B.")<sup><a href="#loc.07292_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> to be correct ought to read say like this:
      "While the many (or while the ? two hundred) quarto volumes of the great french <u>Encyclopédie</u> are being published at fits and
      intervals in Paris" It is not <u>quite</u> correct to call the
      book the "Encyclopédie <u>Française"</u>).<sup><a href="#loc.07292_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup></p> 
   
   <p>We are all well, I am hearty, very glad to get home
      again after my run in the East—though I enjoyed my stay in Philadelphia
      immensely. I feel pretty confident I shall be East again in the course of the
      summer. I hope you will stick to the baths and a moderate rubbing with the hand or
      towel after each—and change your under clothes very often (two or three times
      a week) they need not be <u>washed</u> each time but hung up and
      aired—washing flannel so often soon<sup><a href="#loc.07292_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup> spoils it and is unnecessary

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3115">1. Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="loc.07292_n1">3. Artem Lozynsky
      points to the English translation of Sarrazin's essay to reveal Sarrazin's
      understanding of Whitman's thoughts on the philosopher Hegel: "Surely, I repeat, as
      regards thought this pantheism
      is not new, and we have but to examine it a little closer to recognize under the
      mystic tide of words the theory of the identity of contradictions announced by
      Hegel, the greatest of philosophers according to Walt Whitman, ('Specimen Days,'
      pp. 174–177)" (Gabriel Sarrazin, "Walt Whitman," translated by Harrison S.
      Morris, <em>In Re Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Horace Traubel, Richard
      Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1893],
      163–164). In the essay, "Carlyle from American Points of View," Whitman
      explains that, when it comes to "the impalpable human mind and concrete Nature,"
      Hegel's "fuller statement of the matter [the relation between the
      'Me' and the 'Not me', according to Lozynsky] probably remains the last best word
      that has been said
      upon it, up to date" (<em>Specimen Days</em> [Glasgow: Wilson and
      McCormick, 1883], 175). See <em>The Letters of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman</em>, ed. Artem Loyzynsky (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1977), 113n1.
      Yet, Whitman goes on to write in the same essay that although the philosophers'
      contributions (including Hegel's) are "indispensible to the erudition of America's
      future,"
      "there seems to be . . . something lacking—something cold, a failure to satisfy the
      deepest emotions 
      of the soul—a want of living glow, fondness, warmth, which the old <em>exaltes</em>
      and poets supply, and which the keenest modern philosophers so far do not" (<em>Specimen Days</em> [Glasgow: Wilson and
      McCormick, 1883], 177).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.07292_n4">4. Denis Diderot (1713–1784) was a French philosopher and writer who 
      was the chief editor of the <em>Encyclopédie</em> (1751–1772).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07292_n5">5. Charles-Joseph Panckoucke (1736–1798), a French writer and publisher, oversaw the
      publication of the 
      Encyclopédie Méthodique (1792–1832), along with his son-in-law Henri Agasse (1752–1813);
      Thérèse-Charlotte Agasse—Panckoucke's daughter and Agasse's widow—completed the work.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07292_n6">6. All of Bucke's research here was in the service of one line of Whitman's opening remarks
      in his 
      <em>November Boughs</em> essay "Notes (such as they are) founded on Elias Hicks"; in a catalog of "the foremost
      actors and events from 1750 to 1830 both in Europe and America [that] were crowding
      
      each other on the world's stage," Whitman mentions how "the many quarto volumes of
      the Encyclopædia Française are being published at fits and intervals, by Diderot,
      in Paris."<a href="#r6">[back]
