   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04953_n1">1. In 1880 Whitman paid his
      only visit to London, Ontario, where his friend Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke was
      superintendent of a mental institution. Dr. Bucke accompanied Whitman from
      Camden on June 2, and for almost four months, until September 28, the poet
      vacationed in Canada. See <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>
      (Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company, 1904) and Whitman's Commonplace Book
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The letter must have been written, then,
      between June 4 and September 28, 1880.<a href="#r1">[back]
