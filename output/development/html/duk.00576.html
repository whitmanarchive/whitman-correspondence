   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00576_n1">1. This letter dates to March
      15, 1869. The date "March 15" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand on the
      second page, and Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to 1869. Edwin Haviland
      Miller agreed with Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:367). In March 1869 George Washington Whitman was struggling to keep his
      housebuilding business afloat financially, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman in this
      letter asks Walt Whitman for a loan of "five or six hundred" on George's behalf,
      the "cause of her writing." This direct request had been prepared two weeks
      earlier when Louisa wrote on the reluctance of agents to lend money to George:
      they instead sought the safety of government bonds (see her  letter to Walt). Walt sent a bank
      draft immediately after receiving this letter, and Louisa acknowledged George's
      receipt of the draft (see her 
      letter to Walt). Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman confirmed Walt's loan to George
      a week later (see Jeff's  letter to
      Walt).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00576_n11">2. In his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman, Walt Whitman wrote of "severe cold in my head" and "bad spells,
      dizziness in the head." Walt's suffering continued for some time. In her  letter, Louisa wrote, "i was
      sorry Walter you have them bad spells with your head it must be very bad
      indeed." She also recommended a "kind of linement [<em>sic</em>]
      called cloroform [<em>sic</em>]."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      started a building business with a partner named Smith in 1865, and they were
      joined by a mason named French the following year. See Jerome M. Loving, ed.,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 27–29.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00576_n2">4. According to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman, George Washington Whitman was returning to the R. D. Wood Foundry in
      Camden, New Jersey, to inspect the "new main" for Moses Lane, chief engineer of
      the Brooklyn Water Works. George's brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman also
      had pipe made for the St. Louis Water Works in Camden. George accepted a
      position as inspector of pipes at the foundry in late 1869.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00576_n4">6. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman had agreed to lend his brother George Washington Whitman $2,000 (see
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter
      to Walt Whitman). If there are "800 dollars to come," as Louisa wrote above,
      George had already received six $200 installments from Jeff—with four more
      to come. However, the set of installments may have differed. Louisa attempted to
      provide a complete accounting in her 
      letter to Walt: two installments from Jeff in the amount of $500 each were
      followed by a series of installments of $200, which George eventually expected
      would total $3,000 for a mortgage on top of the initial $1,000 in two
      installments. It is unclear whether Jeff agreed to provide $4,000 in
      full—$3,000 in $200 installments on top of the initial
      $1,000—because he only loaned George $3,400, which was $600 less than
      George expected.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00576_n13">7. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      shortened a series of words in her conventional closing: "mor[e]," "remem[ber],"
      and "you[r]."<a href="#r7">[back]
