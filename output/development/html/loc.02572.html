   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02572_n2">1. Johnston had taken
      Whitman's four-volume edition of Pepys and the two-volume Forman edition of
      Shelley on January 20 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n4126">2. William J. "Billy" Thompson
      (1848–1911), known as "The Duke of Gloucester" and "The Statesman," was a
      friend of Whitman's who operated a hotel, race track, and amusement park on the
      beach overlooking the Delaware River at Gloucester, New Jersey. His shad and
      champagne dinners for Whitman were something of a tradition. See William Sloane
      Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> (1896),
      15–16.<a href="#r2">[back]
