   <p>Dear Sir: I also send you two more little pieces, to take their chances for the magazine.
      The price, if you take them, will be $8 each. I forgot to say, with the one I sent
      yesterday, that whatever pieces are printed, I reserve the right to include them in
      any future collection of my poems.
   </p>

      yours,
      <br></br>W. Whitman

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Russell Lowell had
      been the editor at the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> when Whitman
      published there in 1860. Unbeknownst to Whitman, however, James T. Fields,
      partner in the <em>Atlantic's</em> publisher Ticknor &amp; Fields,
      took over the editorship of the magazine in May 1861 as a cost-saving measure.
      The <em>Atlantic</em> did not publish a list of its editors, and
      Whitman subsequently submitted the poem "1861" on , to Lowell in error. The letter here submits two
      additional poems, unfortunately unidentified. Later, Whitman received an
      impersonal reply dated —signed
      only "Editors of the Atlantic Monthly"—returning "the three poems with which you
      have favored us, but which we could not possibly use before their
      interest,—which is of the present,—would have passed." Horace Traubel questioned
      Whitman about this rejection many years later, but Whitman could not remember
      any of the poems he had submitted, only that he had been puzzled by Lowell's
      reason for their rejection.
