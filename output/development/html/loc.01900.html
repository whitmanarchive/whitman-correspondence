      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Whitman;
      <br></br>Dear Sir
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My desire to address you springs from a question addressed me by a member of my class
      in literature.
   </p>
   
   <p>What do you think of Walt Whitman?</p>
   
   <p>Up to that moment I had read only a single one of your poems "The two mysteries" which
      moved me by its subtlety and beauty. Soon after the question, which I was not prepared
      to answer, came comments in a British Review to the effect that Americans did not
      
      
      
      
      know their poets when they had them, instancing our slow appreciation of yourself—put
      me upon the determination to know your works, but I have only been able to secure
      a volume of Leaves of Grass, which I understand are your earlier poems—
   </p>
   
   <p>I should feel that my addressing you was an insult, if I could pretend not to have
      been moved by these. You seemed to me as near the divine secret of Nature, as most
      poets have been to her external graces and to have restored almost the virginal force,
      and vividness to language. But as true poems, are
      
      
      
      
      not like mosaics to be admired in bits, I have sought to discern the distinctive idea
      which informs and controls the expression in these
   </p>
   
   <p>I feel its presence, but am conscious that I do not define it, nor am I able to get
      at your idea of poetical form which seems to me as essential an element in poetry,
      as lines of beauty are in the plastic arts. Many expressions in your poems pain me
      because many things which seem to me sacred, because natural, are profaned by the
      utterance. I have long been enamored of the poetry of the past, but lately find myself
      longing to come into sympathy with the poetry of the present, and
      
      
      
      most of all, as a teacher, I desire to know the truth of all art. Should you pardoning
      my presumption, and my candor, be kind enough to explain the points to which I have
      referred, I should consider myself highly favored.
   </p>
   
   <p>I do not know which is most likely to reconcile you to the liberty I have taken, the
      accompanying letter, or the recollection of your own words—"Stranger if you passing meet me, and desire
      to speak to me—why should you not speak to me?"
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Little information is available
      about Annie Tolman Smith. She wrote several articles about education, including
      an essay titled "Progress of Education for Women" that appeared in the Annual
      Report of the Department of the Interior (U.S. Government Printing Office,
      1871). In the late 1880s and early 1890s, she worked at the Bureau of Education
      in Washington D.C. (see American Association for the Advancement of Science, <em>General Program of the Meeting</em>, [Washington: The
      Association, 1969] 40:77).
