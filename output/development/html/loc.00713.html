   </p>
   
   <p>Your contribution of $20 for the soldiers in hospital, sick or wounded, has been received—&amp;
      I thank you for it most sincerely. I shall apply it to their aid, faithfully &amp; with
      care.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was out to Harewood yesterday week, &amp; last Sunday—the patients have however since
      been removed to another place, near the Old Douglas hospital. Then there are the Providence
      hospital, &amp; the 5th Reg. Cavalry, &amp; some other small, military hospitals.
   </p>
   
   <p>There are comparatively few soldiers now that need ministering to, but full enough
      to occupy one's spare hours—&amp; especially as half of the inmates of the hospitals are
      discharged soldiers, drawing no pay, though sick, or suffering sometimes very deeply
      indeed, from relapses of old wounds.
   </p>
   
   <p>I wish you health, my friend, in body &amp; in spirit. Farewell.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Garaphelia ("Garry") Howard (1840?–1881?) was one of
      Walt Whitman's Washington friends. In a , letter to Ellen O'Connor, Whitman describes Howard as "a good,
      tender girl—true as steel." (A Garaphelia Gallatin Howard was born in
      Charlestown, Massachusetts in 1840 and died in 1881 in Washington D.C.)
