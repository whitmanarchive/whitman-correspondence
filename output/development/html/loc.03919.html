   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).

   <p id="n0259">2. Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
