   <p>Some six months ago, you wrote me (I was then laid up ill in St Louis) that you had
      purchased the electrotype plates of the 1861 Boston ed'n of my <em>Leaves of Grass</em>—&amp; making me some proposals about them—To which I made answer at the time, as you
      probably bear in mind.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Are you still the owner of those plates? Do you still hold to the offer then made
      by you? Please write me here.
   </p>

      Worthington affair, see the letter from Whitman to Richard Watson Gilder of , where Worthington's letter,
      which Whitman misinterpreted, is quoted. The poet's letter, probably written in
      October 1879, is not known.<a href="#r1">[back]
