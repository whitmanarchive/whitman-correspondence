      <br></br><br></br>My good friend,       
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It was a kind thought of yours sending me your article from the North American Review. I forwarded Alfred his Copy to the Isle of Wight where he is living at present. he will be in London
      before Easter. You <u>may</u> know about when that will be tho' you may not take great keep of the Ancient festival!
   </p>
   
   <p>Alfred will be much pleased with what you say about him in
      
      
      
      in your article, yet perhaps he may not be quite so pleased—it is very difficult to
      discourse on a poet, &amp; to entirely please him.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am sure he will be interested, as I am, in your article</p>
   
   <p>Poets of Eminence, and critics of discernment tell me that the real representative
      poet of America came into view when you first put pen to paper.
   </p>
   
   <p>Certainly nearly all your Poets, delightful as they are,
      
      
      are founded on European models, in subject &amp; form, but, I presume, what you mean strikes
      deeper than that.
   </p>
   
   <p>I will not trouble you with more of my views of this subject!</p>
   
   <p>I hope you are as well and happy as you can hope to be on this best of all possible
      [

   <p>We are losing Carlyle—as I write he is either moribund or dead.</p>
