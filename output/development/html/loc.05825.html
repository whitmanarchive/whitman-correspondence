   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05825_n1">1. When Rolleston wrote on
      , he was in Ireland.
      Acknowledging his failure to persuade a German publisher to undertake the
      volume, he now wanted Whitman to find "a willing publisher with some German
      connection" in America. The book was printed in 1889 in Switzerland. This draft
      letter was written on the verso of an envelope from John K. Randall, a Baltimore
      lawyer. According to Whitman's reference to this letter in his Commonplace Book,
      he must have sent about this time a post card to Rolleston in
      Switzerland.<a href="#r1">[back]
