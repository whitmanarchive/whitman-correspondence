      This postcard bears the address, "Mrs. E. M. O'Connor, | 1015 O st. near 11th
      N. W. | Washington, D.C." It is postmarked: "Camden | (?)| 3 | N.J."<br><br>
      This postcard was apparently written at the same time as Whitman's  letter to Abby H. Price since
      both allude to the "bad spell" of February 1874. Note that in his letter to
      Price, Walt Whitman referred to the receipt of a letter from Ellen
      O'Connor.<a href="#r1">[back]
