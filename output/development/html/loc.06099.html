      (1848â€“1931) was an importer of Hungarian wine in New York City. He made a
      practice of sending complimentary cases of wine to individuals he admired. The
      archive of letters of thanks at the New York Historical Society includes
      appreciative replies from Robert Browning, Samuel Clemens, Grover Cleveland,
      Ulysses S. Grant, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and John
      Greenleaf Whittier, among others.
