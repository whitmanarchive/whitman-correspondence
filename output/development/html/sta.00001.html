   </p>
   
   <p>Your welcome gift of money for wounded here, ($5) came safe to-day &amp; is most acceptable—Most
      of wounded brought up here now are without a cent—Many of the cases appeal very strongly—(I
      sometimes think only one going among the men as I do, with personal feeling &amp; my own
      way of investigation understands how deep &amp; what sort the appeal is)—the hospitals
      are very full—Armory Square has more inmates than many a well known New England village—I
      go as usual to one or another hospital &amp; to Alexandria, day &amp; night—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear friend, I shall always be glad to hear from you—Should you find any you know
      who are able &amp; who feel to aid the wounded, through me, it would come <em>very acceptable now</em>—sure to reach addressed
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
      Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry
         Boy and the Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
      their meetings in <em>My Own Story</em>, (Boston: Houghton and
      Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
      11, 1862, Trowbridge had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending
      Whitman; see Emerson's letter from . Though Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to
      William D. O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that
      no book has approached the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and
      Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For
      Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
      also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948),
      262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.
