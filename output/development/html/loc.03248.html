      Mr. Walt Whitman,
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Last spring I wrote to you informing you that the pupils of the public schools of
      this place, contemplated planting a tree and naming it in honor of you. But as I did
      not receive an answer from you, and thinking that my letter miscarried, I concluded
      to write again, and name the tree of their planting of the next "Arbor
      Day"—Oct. 18" 1889, in honor of you. I would be pleased to receive a letter
      from you giving the pupils some encouragement in this grand work of
      tree-planting—I will read it to them on "Arbor Day" which we celebrate one
      week from today—Hoping to hear from you—I am—
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Very truly yours—
      <br></br>A K McIlhaney
      <br></br>Principal of Schools—
