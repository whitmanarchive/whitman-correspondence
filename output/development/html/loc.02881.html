      Earls Colne, Halstead
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Feb 21 1875
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have run down to Colne for a glimpse of my dear Bee whom I had not seen for five months,
      &amp; of my Mother, &amp; now I am alone with the latter, Beatrice taking my place
      at home with her brother &amp; sister for a week or two. A wonderful evergreen my
      Mother continues; still able to face the keen winds &amp; the frost daily in her
      Bath chair—well swathed of course in eiderdown &amp; flannels. Beatrice takes
      beautiful care of her &amp; is happy &amp; content with her life here, loving the
      country as dearly as I do &amp; having time enough for study &amp; reading as well
      as for domestic activities to keep her mind as busy as her body. How I do long for
      you to see my children, dearest Friend. I wonder if you are surrounded with any in
      your brother's home—young growing  blossoming plants that gladden you. And
      I wonder if the winter which I hear is so severe in America this year, tries
      you— whether you can yet move briskly enough to keep up the
      circulation—and whether you have as many dear friends round you as you had at
      Washington. In my walks I keep thinking of these things. Write me a little letter
      once more, it would do me such good. No one of all your friends so easy as I to
      write to, because none to whom any &amp; every little detail is so welcome, so
      precious,—lifting a tiny corner of the great vast of space between us giving
      me for a moment to feel the friendly grasp of your hand—I that long for it
      so.—Two years 
      are
      
      over since your illness began or seemed to begin dearest friend—so slow &amp;
       stealthy in its
      approaches, so slow &amp; stealthy in its retreat—may the Spring that is
      coming (the birds have already caught sight of it, cold &amp; brown &amp; bare as
      the landscape still is) may it but come laden with healing strengthening refreshing
      influences—so that you begin to feel again the joyous freedom of health
      warbling once more a song of joy for Lilac time. True I know indeed my dearest that
      anyhow you are content, not grudging the price paid for your life work, but even
      some way or other the richer for paying it—garnering precious equivalents for
      pain &amp; privation of health in your inmost soul. I cannot choose but believe this
      earnestly—the resplendent faith that there is not "one cause nor result
      lamentable, at last, in the Universe" which  glows throughout the Poems is for me an
      exhaustless source of strength &amp; comfort.—I see [
      <span class="unclear">every</span>]
       now &amp; then
      &amp; like the more each time the Conways. I am half afraid Mr. Conway works too incessantly—that is does not like well
      enough the indispensable supplement of close mental work—plenty of air &amp;
      exercise—[
      <span class="unclear">he?</span>]
      
       hates walking, &amp; indeed it is not to be wondered
      at in great smoky London (I shall be fond enough &amp; proud enough of it too when I
      am over the Atlantic). Unless one has a real passion for open air &amp; the sense of
      sky overhead, like me. I hear Mr. Conway is coming to America for six months in
      October. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Feb. 25—I kept my letter till today that I might
      have the happiness of [
      <span class="unclear">speaking</span>]
      
       to you on my
      birthday. See me this evening in the bright cheerful parlour of our cottage which
      stands just in the middle of the old village (it has  been a village &amp; jogged on through
      all change at its own sober sleepy pace this 800 years) my mother in her arm chair
      by the fire, I chatting with her &amp; working or playing to her when she is awake,
      &amp; with the Poems I love beside me reading musing pondering
       while she dozes. Ah, shall I ever attain to the
      Ideal that burst upon me with such splendour of light &amp; joy in those Poems in
      1869—so filling, so possessing me I seemed as if I had by one bound attained
      to that ideal—as if I were already a very twin of the soul from whom they
      emanated. But now I know that divine foretaste indicated what was possible for me
      not what was accomplished—I know the slow growth—the standstill winters
      that follow  the
      growing joyous springs &amp; ripening summers. I believe it will take more lives
      than this one to reach that mountain on which I was transfigured again, never to
      descend more, but to start thence for new [
      <span class="unclear">heights, fresh?</span>]
       glories. Ah, dear Friend, will you be able
      to have patience with me, for me?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
