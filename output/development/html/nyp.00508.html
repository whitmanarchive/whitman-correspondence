   <p>A young workingman &amp; engineer, Edward Doyle, (brother of my dear friend Peter D.)<sup><a href="#loc.05091_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> may call on you, before long, to see what chance if any for employment. He is healthy,
      strong, intelligent for a laboring man—no bad habits—single—hails from Washington.
      I am well as usual—Nothing new—I send you a paper—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05091_n1">1. Doyle spent the afternoon
      of December 7 with Whitman (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). He visited the poet again on June 4, 1884. When Doyle's
      mother was dying, on May 23, 1885, Whitman sent $10, and he lent Doyle
      $15 when he came to Camden on June 4, 1885 (Whitman's Commonplace Book). In
      the 1870s Edward Doyle, like Peter, had been a streetcar conductor.<a href="#r1">[back]
