      <br></br><br></br>W. M. Rossetti—Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yours of the 28th Feb.<sup><a href="#pri.00016_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> rec'd, &amp; indeed welcomed &amp; appreciated. I am jogging along still about the same in physical
      condition—still certainly no worse, &amp; I sometimes lately suspect rather better, or
      at any rate more adjusted to the situation—Even begin to think of making some move,
      some change of base, &amp;c. (the doctors have been advising it for over two years, 
      but I hav'n't felt to do it, yet.) My paralysis does not lift—I cannot walk any distance—I still
      have this baffling, 
      obstinate, apparently chronic affection of the stomachic apparatus &amp; liver—Yet, (as
      told in former letters) I get out doors 
      a little every day—write &amp; read, in moderation—appetite sufficiently good, (eat only
      very plain food, 
      but always did that)—digestion tolerable—&amp; spirits unflagging. (As said above, I have
      told you most of this before, 
      but suppose you might like to know it all again, up to date.) Of course, &amp; pretty
      darkly coloring the whole, 
      are bad spells, prostrations, <u>some pretty grave</u> ones, intervals—&amp; I have resigned myself to the certainty 
      of permanent incapacitation from solid work—but things may continue at least in this
      half-and-half way, 
      for months—even years.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My books are out, the new edition, a set of which, immediately on 'receiving your
      letter' of 28th, I have 
      sent you (by mail March 15)<sup><a href="#pri.00016_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; I suppose you have before this rec'd them.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My dear friend, your offers of help, &amp; those of my other British friends, I think
      I fully appreciate, 
      in the right spirit, welcome &amp; acceptive—leaving the matter altogether in your &amp; their
      hands—&amp; to your &amp; their 
      convenience, discretion, leisure &amp; nicety—Though poor now even to penury <u>I have not so far been deprived 
         of any physical thing I need or wish whatever—&amp; I feel confident I shall not, in the
         future</u>. During my 
      employment of seven years or more in Washington after the war (1865–'72) I regularly
      saved a great part of my
      wages—&amp; though the sum has now become about exhausted, by my expenses of the last
      three years—there are already 
      beginning at present welcome dribbles hitherward from the sales of my new edition
      which I just job &amp; sell, 
      myself, (as the book agents here for 3 years in New York have successively, deliberately,
      badly cheated me)<sup><a href="#pri.00016_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; shall continue to dispose of the books myself. And <u>that</u> is the way I should prefer to glean my support—In that way I cheerfully accept all
      the aid my friends find it convenient to proffer (Prof. Dowden has sent me 
      the money for seven sets—which I have forwarded to him at Dublin.<sup><a href="#pri.00016_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I wish you to loan this letter to him to read.) I wish you to notify me—by postal
      card will do—soon as you receive your books sent on the 15th—I wish you also to loan
      this letter 
      to Mrs. Gilchrist, first of all. I shall write to her to-day or to-morrow—but briefly.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To repeat a little, &amp; without undertaking details, understand, dear friend, for yourself
      &amp; all, that I heartily 
      &amp; most affectionately thank my British friends, &amp; that I accept their sympathetic
      generosity in the same spirit 
      in which I believe (nay, <u>know</u>) it is offered—that 
      though poor <u>I am not in want</u>—that I maintain good heart 
      &amp; cheer—&amp; that by far the most satisfaction to me (&amp; I think it can be done, &amp; believe
      it will be,) will be 
      to live, as long as possible, on <u>the sales</u>, <u>by myself</u>, <u>of my own works</u>—&amp; perhaps, if practicable, 
      by further writings for the press.

   <p>There is a small fury &amp; much eructive spitting &amp; sputtering already among the "literary

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00016_n1">1. Although previously
      confused by conflicting press reports as to Whitman's financial straits,
      Rossetti accepted Whitman's statements in the <em>West Jersey
         Press</em> and in Whitman's letter to Rossetti of . In a letter to Whitman on , Rossetti wrote: "There are some of us who 
      wd
      
       really be glad to exert ourselves to the extent of our moderate means,
      to prove that we are not insensible of the obligations we owe you." Yet in this
      letter Whitman was silently modifying his own earlier accounts; in fact, his
      position as now stated did not materially differ from that in the Springfield
      <em>Republican</em> which had led to the reply in the <em>West Jersey Press</em>. Rossetti distributed facsimiles of
      this letter to English admirers.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00016_n2">2. On  Rossetti informed Whitman that Anne
      Gilchrist and he would shortly send £10 (approximately $50) for sets of
      Whitman's new edition.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00016_n3">3. For Whitman's account of
      this alleged embezzlement, see the letter from Whitman to an unidentified
      correspondent of .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00016_n4">4. See Whitman's letter to
      Edward Dowden of .<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00016_n5">5. Buchanan had written in
      praise of Whitman as early as 1867 (see the letter from Whitman to Routledge
      &amp; Sons of , and the letter
      from Whitman to Rudolf Schmidt of ). His account in the London newspaper was based on excerpts from the
      <em>West Jersey Press</em> which Rossetti had inserted in <em>The Athenaeum</em> on March 11. Rossetti's letter in support
      of Buchanan appeared in the London <em>Daily News</em> on March
      14.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00016_n6">6. Except for this final
      paragraph, which was probably added later, the letter differs from a draft
      version held by the Library of Congress only in insignificant verbal changes
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919).<a href="#r6">[back]
