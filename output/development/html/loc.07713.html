      Feeling middling—am scribbling a little—I believe the ensuing
      <u>Century</u> is to print my little poemet "My 71st Year"<sup><a href="#loc.07713_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>—&amp; I think of sending
      off a piece to Harper's—sent it off Friday evn'g—w'd make a page<sup><a href="#loc.07713_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
      fine sunny weather, now the third day—A young rather green fellow,
      Charles Sterrit, came over here as candidate for my new nurse &amp; helper—
      could not tell only from practical trial—is to come Monday—what slight
      impression I had was rather pleasant—we are all sorry Ed<sup><a href="#n4319" id="r4">4</a></sup> is going—
      every thing has been smooth &amp; good without anything—no hitch or anything
      of the kind—bowel action this forenoon—pretty fair I guess these late &amp;
      current days—am sitting here in my den, alone as usual—have rec'd the 
      Boston "<u>Transatlantic</u>," it is like <u>Harper's Weekly</u> in form, &amp; semi-
      monthly—Y'r letters come—thanks—O how beautiful it looks out—the sun
      shining clear—&amp;the active people flitting to and fro— 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      9 P M—am sitting here alone—comfortable enough—Ed has gone 
      over to the theatre with one of Mrs. D's<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r5">5</a></sup> boys<sup><a href="#loc.07713_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—

      all are stout &amp; well &amp; hearty over there in London—Mary<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r8">8</a></sup> least so, but she 
      not ill—I guess "society" (a great humbug) is a bad strain on her, &amp; the
      responsibility of household &amp; two little children—&amp; Mary is not a rugged
      girl—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07713_n1">1. This letter is addressed: Dr
      Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, NJ | Oct

      PA | Oct | 19 | 9 PM | 1889 | Transit; NY | 10-20-89 | 9 AM; London | PM | OC 21

   <p id="loc.07713_n3">2. Whitman's poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00006.html">My 71st Year</a>" was published in <em>Century Illustrated
         Monthly Magazine</em> in November 1889.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07713_n2">3. On October 18, 1889,
      Whitman sent a cluster of poems entitled "Old Age's Echoes" to Henry Mills Alden
      of <em>Harper's New Monthly Magazine</em> and asked $100
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book [Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.]). On
      October 24, Alden rejected the work: "It is too much of an improvisation for our
      use. I had it set up, hoping that, seeing it in type, I might come to a more
      favorable impression of its form. The thought is worthy of a more careful
      texture in its parts &amp; of a more shapely embodiment as a whole. I am not
      critisizing. Criticism has no place in the poet's world. I am writing only as a
      Magazine editor with reference to Magazine requirements." Alden's letter cannot
      be located. On November 2, 1889, Whitman sent the piece, now called "Old Age
      Echoes," to <em>Nineteenth Century</em> and asked £20; the
      editor, James Knowles, returned the manuscript on . The "3 or 4 sonnets poemets," as the poet
      characterized the work in his Commonplace Book, were eventually published in the
      March 1891 issue of Lippincott's Magazine. Here, the
      poem "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00140.html">Old-Age Echoes</a>" consists of the "poemets" titled "Sounds of the
      Winter," "The Unexpress'd," "Sail out for Good, EidÓlon Yacht!" and "After
      the Argument." "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00139.html">To the Sun-Set Breeze</a>" appeared in <em>Lippincott's
         Monthly Magazine</em> in December, 1890; Whitman received $60
      (Commonplace Book).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">4. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6113">5. Mary Oakes Davis (1837 or
      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_92.html">Davis, Mary Oakes (1837 or 1838–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07713_n4">6. Whitman is probably
      referring to either Harry (Henry) or Warren (Warry) Fritzinger. Prior to
      becoming Whitman's housekeeper, Mary Davis had worked for Henry Whireman
      Fritzinger, a blind sea captain. Following his death in 1881, Mary served as a
      guardian for the Fritzinger boys.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.07866_n5">7. Alys Smith (1867–1951)
      was Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe's sister. She would eventually marry the
      philosopher Bertrand Russell.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02189_n1">8. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="n4267">10. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
