      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thank you for the Camden papers which you kindly sent me, containing the
      paragraphs anent the Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r1">1</a></sup> Lecture. By their refusal to
      let the Hall the Philadelphians have belittled themselves in the eyes of all
      good men and true, and their attempt to stifle free discussion 
      shews
      
       that the spirit of intolerance and the narrow-minded ecclesiasticism
      which consigned Giordano Bruno to the stake still survives in your "City of
      Brotherly Love." I
      hope you had a good time + I shall look forward with pleasure to seeing a report
      of the meeting.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We had a grand meeting here on Oct 6<u>th</u> when I read to
      the friends J. W. W.'s "occasional out-of-door notes" upon yourself and your
      teaching, which were much appreciated by all. Some of the things that were said
      in the discussion or rather friendly talk, which followed prompted J. W. W. to
      write a "Rejoinder" which he requested me to read to the friends on Monday night
      last (Oct 20<u>th</u>) when we had another delightful
      symposium—some of the friends, Wentworth Dixon, Tho. Shorrock + myself contributing notes
      to the discussion and the others taking part in the interesting after talk
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>R. K. Greenhalgh has received the copy of the pocket book edition of <u>L. of G</u> which you kindly sent to him + is greatly
      pleased with it. On Sunday last he took it to the Parish Church Sunday School,
      where he is a teacher, + read extracts from it, including the "Prayer of
      Columbus," to his scholars.
   </p>
   
   <p>I had a very cordial letter from Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> the other day in
      which he said that he would probably see you on the occasion of the Ingersoll
      Lecture. <u>That</u> I know will be a great pleasure to you +
      I have no doubt
      you will have a good time together.
   </p>
   
   <p>By the way it so happens that Charles Bradlaugh—the English
      Ingersoll—is lecturing tonight in Bolton Oct 21<u>st</u>—same date as yours—on "Doubt, the mother of
      Progress."
   </p>
   
   <p>I don't think I have told you that in April last J. W. W. made me a present of a
      copy of the Thayer + Eldridge<sup><a href="#loc.00568_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> (1860) Edition of <u>L. of G.</u> with the portrait which brings out the Dutch
      elements in your features.
   </p>
   
   <p>I enclose a cutting from <u>The Family Herald</u>—a
      paper with a wide circulation—which may be of interest to you.
   </p>
   
   <p>I hope the <u>grippe</u> has quite left you + that you are now
      in better health
   </p>
   
   <p>J. W. W. has got back to work but still complains of a lack of nerve energy.</p>
   
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      With best love to you + kindest regards to all your household, remain,
      yours, affectionately,

   <p></span><span class="handshift">Geo. H. Dawson.—When
      we spoke of Mr. Ruskin's<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r4">4</a></sup> critic, we did not argue the case
      between the two men. One is a practical painter who has undoubted genius, and he
      certainly knows what he is talking about. He thinks that Mr. Ruskin has mistaken
      notions about art; and we fear you will find that very many artists share that
      opinion. For our own part, we are pagan enough to say that we do not very much
      care even if any one tells us that Mr. Ruskin knows nothing about brushes and
      pigments. His prose is an abiding glory and delight; and, as to the question of
      his practical ability, we are very well content to let the artists fight it out
      among themselves. You are quite right—the critic is born, not made.
      By-the-way, you speak of Whitman's critical powers. Do you know that he is one
      of the most exquisitely delicate of literary critics? Some of his judgments on
      such men as Carlyle,<sup><a href="#n4301" id="r5">5</a></sup> Longfellow,<sup><a href="#n0367" id="r6">6</a></sup>
      Emerson,<sup><a href="#n1044" id="r7">7</a></sup> Scott,<sup><a href="#n4277" id="r8">8</a></sup> Whittier,<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r9">9</a></sup> Edgar Allan Poe, and even Homer and 
      Shakspere
      
      , seem to us almost flawless. In your list of critics you do not
      mention Matthew Arnold.<sup><a href="#loc.05536_n4" id="r10">10</a></sup> Had it not been for Arnold's
      most heartbreaking affectation, he would have been among the highest; but he
      spoiled himself by writing in a fashion which, although it was often felicitous,
      was more often insufferable. You mention Schlegel. Name of fear! We wish the
      Germans had never seen 
      Shakspere
      
      , and we wish that a serious accident would irrevocably destroy all the
      works of all the commentators. When a man writes a learned essay to prove that
      Macbeth was the third murderer, we have got quite far enough.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0839">1. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00568_n3">3. Thayer and Eldridge was a
      Boston publishing firm responsible for the third edition of Walt Whitman's <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde [1829–1896] and Charles W. Eldridge

         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">4. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4301">5. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881)
      was a Scottish essayist, historian, lecturer, and philosopher. For more on
      Carlyle, see John D. Rosenberg, <em>Carlyle and the Burden of
         History</em> (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1985).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0367">6. In his time, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
      (1807–1882) was both a highly popular and highly respected American poet.
      His <em>The Song of Hiawatha</em>, published the same year as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, enjoyed sales never reached by Whitman's
      poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
      manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
      not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:129–130).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1044">7. Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.
      For more on Emerson, see Jerome Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4277">8. Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832)
      was a Scottish statesman, historical novelist, playwright, and poet, best known
      for <em>Ivanhoe</em> (1820), <em>The Lady of the
         Lake</em> (1810), and <em>Waverly</em> (1814). For more on
      Scott, see Vickie L. Taft, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_209.html">Scott, Sir Walter (1771)–1832)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">9. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.05536_n4">10. The English poet and
      critic Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) first came to America on a lecture tour
      in October, 1883, and remained until March, 1884. He "returned to England
      confirmed by experience in his conception of the average American as a hard
      uninteresting type of Philistine." After a second trip to the United States in
      the summer of 1886, Arnold commented on American life being "uninteresting, so
      without savour and without depth" (Stuart P. Sherman, <em>Matthew
         Arnold</em> [Indianapolis, 1917], 46–49).<a href="#r10">[back]
