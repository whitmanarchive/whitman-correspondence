   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0912">1. The "Book on the war" was probably
      Whitman's <em>Memoranda During the War</em>. Six sections of this
      book first appeared as newspaper pieces in 1874, and then were collected and
      revised for the book publication in 1875. See Robert Leigh Davis, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_32.html">Memoranda During the War [1875-1876]</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0818">2. Not much information is known about
      Thomas B. Freeman other than that he was a young man in whom Whitman took an
      interest. Freeman notes that he was "born the first year of the war," which
      would make him roughly 16 years old at the time of his first letter to Whitman.
      The poet mentioned sending Freeman material on several occasions (most likely a
      copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, a newspaper piece by Whitman
      that appeared in the Philadelphia <em>Times</em>, and a copy of
      <em>Drum-Taps</em>). See <em>Walt Whitman:
         Daybooks and Notebooks</em>, ed. William White (New York: New York
      University Press, 1978), 1:32, 36, and 56.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0336">3. John H. Johnston (1837–1919) was a New York
      jeweler and close friend of Whitman. Johnston was also a friend of Joaquin
      Miller (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> [New
      York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915], 2:139). Whitman visited the Johnstons for the
      first time early in 1877. In 1888 he observed to Horace Traubel: "I count
      [Johnston] as in our inner circle, among the chosen few" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.81.html">Wednesday, October 3, 1888</a>). See also Johnston's letter about
      Whitman, printed in Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man,
         Poet and Friend</em> (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1915), 149–174. For
      more on Johnston, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
