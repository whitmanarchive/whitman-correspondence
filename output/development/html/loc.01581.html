   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your second letter yesterday—it is a real comfort to me to get such
      letters from you, dear friend. Every word does me good. The <em>Star</em> came all right, &amp; was quite interesting. I suppose you got my
      second letter last Wednesday. There is nothing new or special to write about
      to-day—still I thought I would send you a few lines, for Sunday. I put down
      off hand, &amp; write all about myself &amp; my doings, &amp;c. because I suppose
      that will be really what my dear comrade wants most to hear, while we are separated.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am doing a little literary work, according as I feel in the mood—composing on
      my books. I am having a small edition of the Leaves of Grass for 1867, fixed up
      &amp; printed. This &amp; some other things give me a little occupation. Upon the
      whole though I don't do much, but go around a great deal—eat my rations every
      time, sleep at night like a top, &amp; am having good times so far, in a quiet way,
      enjoying New York, the society of my mother, &amp; lots of friends. Among other
      things I spend a portion of the day, with the pilots of the ferry boats, sailing on
      the river. The river &amp; bay of New York &amp; Brooklyn are always a great
      attraction to me. It is a lively scene. At either tide, flood or ebb, the water is
      always rushing along as if in haste, &amp; the river is often crowded with steamers,
      ships &amp; small craft, moving in different directions, some coming in from sea,
      others going out. Among the pilots are some of my particular friends—when I
      see them up in the pilot house on my way to Brooklyn, I go up &amp; sail to &amp;
      fro several trips. I enjoy an hour or two's sail of this kind very much indeed.<sup><a href="#loc.01581_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> My mother
      &amp; folks are well, &amp; are engaged just these times in the delightful business
      of moving. I should assist, but have hired a substitute in the shape of a stout
      young laboring man.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you, by mail, a copy of <em>the Broadway</em>, with the piece
      in<sup><a href="#loc.01581_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> the same as I had in the car one day. It will not interest you
      much, only as something coming from me.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think of you very often, dearest comrade, &amp; with more calmness than when I was
      there—I find it first rate to think of you, Pete, &amp; to know that you are
      there, all right, &amp; that I shall return, &amp; we will be together again. I
      don't know what I should do if I hadn't you to think of &amp; look forward to.<sup><a href="#loc.01581_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tell Tom Hasset,<sup><a href="#loc.01581_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> on No. 7, that I wish to be remembered to him
      particular. Pete, I hope this will find you entirely well of your cold. I am glad
      to
      hear that your mother is all right of her cold. This is the time of year when they
      are apt to be pretty troublesome. I should like to have seen that match played
      between the Nat. &amp; Olympics.<sup><a href="#loc.01581_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01581_n1">1. This draft letter is
      endorsed, "3d letter | Sept 25 | letters sent | 1st 18th Sept. | 2d—22
      | 3d—25th | 4th—29 | 5th Oct 2 | 6th—Oct 6 | 7th Oct 9. |
      Oct 9—sent papers to | P. D. Harper's &amp; Star | Charley
      Sorrell—Clipper | Wm Sydnor—Sporting Life | Jas
      Sorrell—Sporting Life."<br><br>
      These "papers" probably included the September 26, 1868, issue of <em>Harper's Weekly</em>, which contained some of Thomas
      Nast's brutal cartoons aimed at the Democratic party. The New York <em>Clipper</em> excerpt, "The Oldest American Sporting and
      Theatrical Journal." The Sorrells were evidently brothers and drivers.
      William Sydnor was described in an address book as "driver car boy on
      Pittsburgh's car 7th st" (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman,
      The Library of Congress, Notebook #108); Walt Whitman inquired about
      Sydnor's health in his 
      letter to Lewis Wraymond. <em>Sporting Life</em> was a weekly
      sports magazine.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01581_n2">2. Since Walt Whitman's first
      two letters to Peter Doyle are not extant, this is the beginning of an extensive
      correspondence. Doyle, however, had written on the day Walt Whitman had sent his
      first letter. Doyle's letter of 
      is characteristic.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01581_n3">3. At this point Walt
      Whitman inserted a direction to himself: "Mention the two letters I have
      sent."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01581_n4">4. <a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01581_n5">5. Walt Whitman crossed out
      the following: "I have been with M. (the lady that was there [in] W[ashington] .
      . ."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01581_n6">6. Perhaps Thomas Hassett,
      listed in the Washington Directory as a laborer. The name is spelled Hassett in
      Whitman's  letter to Doyle.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01581_n7">7. The Washington Nationals
      defeated the Olympics 21 to 15 on September 21, 1868.<a href="#r7">[back]
