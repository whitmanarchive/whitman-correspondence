   <p>The weather has fallen into the sulks but I don't let that trouble me at
      all—just jog along and pay very little attention to it—It will come
      round all in good time and we shall have a grand fall yet I do not doubt. The hot
      weather must be about over even with you and the pleasant cool autumn days will
      surely revive you and cheer you up. I hope you will be able to get out a little in
      an easy carriage before the cold weather comes.

   <p>I fancy Herbert Gilchrist<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r2">2</a></sup> must be with you by this
      time—give him my kind regards and tell him I hope to see him in Philadelphia
      before long—i.e. if he makes any stay—I am in hopes he will take a run
      west and see the Asylum before he goes back to England. Yesterday was my wedding
      day—we are 23 years married<sup><a href="#n4273" id="r3">3</a></sup>—getting to be quite old folk! We had some
      people in in the evening, had quite a pleasant time. Nothing new about the
      meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—nothing much can be done until the patents are secured and this will
      take some weeks yet.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
