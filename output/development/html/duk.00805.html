   <p>Your card rec'd some days since—I had a sun stroke two weeks ago—makes me
      weak since (legs and bones like gelatine)—but I guess I am
      recuperating—My Phila: publisher McKay was just over here to pay me the income
      on the last six months' sales of my two Vols. L of G. and S Days—the am't was
      $22: &amp; six cts.<sup><a href="#duk.00805_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00805_n1">1. This card flattered
      Kennedy, who observed fervidly in : "Your
      confidential item ab't royalties also makes me glad &amp; wrings my heart at the
      same time." He enclosed $5, which, he declared, "is a pure <u>business</u> debt. $5000. represents my soul indebtedness to Walt Whitman,
      who is the only <u>god</u> I at present worship apart from
      the Universe as a whole."<a href="#r1">[back]
