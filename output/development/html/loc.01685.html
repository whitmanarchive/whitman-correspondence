   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01685_n1">1. Charles Warren Stoddard
      (1843–1909) published <em>Poems</em>, edited by Bret Harte,
      in 1867. His most famous book, <em>South-Sea Idyls</em> (1873), is
      mentioned in Walt Whitman's  letter
      to Stoddard. He was a journalist, a lecturer at the Catholic University of
      America from 1889 to 1902, and for a brief period Mark Twain's secretary.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01685_n2">2. Stoddard's first letter
      was written on , when he was about
      24; he requested (or beseeched) an autograph. When he wrote again on , he was in Honolulu, and passionately
      implored an answer. Fascinated with the "Calamus" theme, Stoddard began a
      correspondence with Burroughs; see Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1931), 48. See also
      Whitman's  letter to
      Stoddard.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01685_n3">3. In his letter of , Stoddard described his entry into a
      typical native village: "The native villagers gather about me, for strangers are
      not common in these parts. I observe them closely. Superb looking, many of them.
      Fine heads…Proud, defiant lips, a matchless physique, grace and freedom in
      every motion. I mark one, a lad of eighteen or twenty years who is regarding me.
      I call him to me, ask his name, giving mine in return. He speaks it over and
      over, manipulating my body 
      unconciously
      
      , as it were, with bountiful and unconstrained love. I go to his
      grass-house, eat with him his simple food. Sleep with him upon his mats, and at
      night sometimes waken to find him watching me with earnest, patient looks, his
      arm over my breast and around me." After listening to Horace Traubel read this
      letter, Walt Whitman commented: "Occidental people, for the most part, would not
      only not understand but would likewise condemn the sort of thing about which
      Stoddard centers his letter" (Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.42.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> [1906–1996],
      4:269).<a href="#r3">[back]

      appear in the draft; otherwise there are no significant alterations.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.01685_n5">5. Whitman probably sent the
      Washington <em>Sunday Chronicle</em> of May 9, 1869.<a href="#r5">[back]
