      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will write you just a line, to show you I am here away north, &amp; alive &amp; kicking.
      
      I delivered my poem here before the College yesterday. All went off very well.—(It
      is rather provoking—after feeling unusually well this whole summer,—since 
      Sunday last I have been about half sick &amp; am so yet, by spells.) I am to go 
      to Vermont, for a couple of days, &amp; then back to Brooklyn—Pete I received your letter,
      that you had been taken off—write to me Saturday 30th or Sunday—direct to usual address 107 Portland av. Brooklyn. I will
      send you the little book with my poem, 
      (&amp; others) when I get back to Brooklyn. Pete did my poem appear in the Washington
      papers—I suppose Thurs-day or Friday—<u>Chronicle</u> or <u>Patriot</u>?<sup><a href="#loc.01598_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—If so, send me one—(or one of each)
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>—It is a curious scene here, as I write, a beautiful old New England village, 150
      years old, 
      large houses &amp; gardens, great elms, plenty of hills—every thing comfortable, but very
      Yankee—<u>not an African to be seen all day</u>—not a grain of dust—not a car to be seen or heard—green 
      grass every where—no smell of <u>coal tar</u>—As I write a party are playing base ball on a large green 
      in front of the house—the weather suits me first rate—cloudy but no rain.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
