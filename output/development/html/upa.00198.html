   <p>I am down here spending a few days<sup><a href="#upa.00198_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Every thing
      continues very much the same—Our friends the S[tafford]s still at Glendale,
      farming &amp; store-keeping—Mr and Mrs S. &amp; all the boys &amp; girls as
      usual—
   </p>
   
   <p>Nothing very new with me—I suppose you have 
      rec'd
      
       my pieces, slips, papers
      &amp;c. sent the past winter<sup><a href="#upa.00198_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I 
      rec'd
      
       your good
      letter 
      ab't
      
       ten days ago<sup><a href="#upa.00198_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—trust you are yourself
      again in sound health by this time<sup><a href="#upa.00198_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I believe I
      wrote last 
      ab't
      
       my being somewhat unwell<sup><a href="#upa.00198_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—got badly
      
      chill'd—felt the effects two months—am now pretty well over it, &amp;
      expect to be as usual till next time—My brother &amp; sister well—J[ohn]
      B[urroughs] is reading the proofs of new book <em>Pepacton</em> (the
      Indian name of a beautiful little river)<sup><a href="#upa.00198_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—I am out
      in the woods a great deal—to-day mild but damp &amp; cloudy—a little
      bird they call the rain-bird is singing softly &amp; coyly on a bush over the
      road—
