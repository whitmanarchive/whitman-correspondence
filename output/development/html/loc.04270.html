      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman,
      <br></br>Dear Sir,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am a stranger to you, but have long been an admirer of your writings. Perhaps you
      have heard of me as at one time editor of the "Radical Review," which published J.
      B. Marvin's admirable essay entitled "Walt Whitman." The action of the Massachusetts
      authorities and the cowardice of the Osgoods prompt me to write to you. I am ashamed
      of the whole business. What do you propose to do? Some steps should be at once taken
      for the republication of your book, from the same plates, in the same locality where
      it has been struck down. Is there no one that will undertake it? With able counsel
      to conduct the case I do not believe a jury could be
      
      
      found in Massachusetts to send the
      publisher of "Leaves of Grass" to prison. At any rate the question ought to be tested.
      If I had the means, I would gladly, with your permission, put your book on the
      market advertised as the suppressed edition, and invite the authorities to dispute
      my right to do so. What I will do is this, if nothing better can be done. If you
      will find parties to furnish the means for republication from your plates,
      advertising the book, and defending it in court, I will become the responsible
      publisher, and go to prison if necessary. In case the verdict should be against me
      and I should be fined, I should decline to pay the fine. It seems to me highly
      important that the people of America should know exactly how far they can safely
      indulge in the expression of their opinions. What do you say? If you desire to know
      anything about me before  replying to so important a question, you may inquire of S. H.
      Morse, Quincy, Mass., the sculptor, whom you know, and who has long been one of my
      intimate friends. He does not know of my design in this matter, but he will tell you
      that I am thoroughly reliable, and no notoriety-hunter or anything of that kind.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours indignantly,
      <br></br>Benj. R. Tucker.
