      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, it is a dark cloudy day, &amp; raining hard—the darkies were to have a
      great celebration here to-day, in honor of emancipation—they turn out here in
      real good style, on such occasions—but it is too wet for them to-day—Mr. Stanbery
      is quite ill, as you see by the papers—The Impeachment trial
      still goes on—I went up, that day,<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> but it was very crowded,
      &amp; the air was so bad, I left, &amp; went off &amp; had a real good tramp, way up
      Georgetown, along the banks of the river—it is beautiful along there, of a
      fine day—So you see I am still able to get around.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new in the office—the same old story—I have rec'd a
      number of papers from England with notices of my book, there—mostly friendly
      &amp; favorable—more so than any here<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Mother, I am very sorry you have those pains in your
      face &amp; head<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I shouldn't wonder if it was neuralgia—that is a
      violent inflammation of the nerves of the face &amp; head—Mrs. Mix<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> used to have it very bad—O, I
      forgot I believe to tell you Mrs. Mix is living yet—she had a very bad spell,
      but got over it—Mother, I have just got your letter of 14th—&amp; was
      glad to get it—I havn't seen William Velsor<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> for some time—will tell him when I see him—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I send a couple of papers same time with this—they are not much, but
      will do just for a change—poor old Uncle John<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—he is failing then
      at last—I suppose George<sup><a href="#nyp.00280_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> is well, &amp; having good times—I see him
      every day as I have his picture tacked up on the door of my desk in front—Good bye,
      dearest mother, &amp; take good care of yourself, &amp; dont work too
      hard.

   <p id="nyp.00280_n1">1. A reference to a lost
      letter.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00280_n2">2. In his  letter to John Camden Hotten, Walt
      Whitman wrote graciously about the reviews Hotten had been forwarding.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00280_n3">3. On , Louisa Van Velsor Whitman said that
      she was "troubled with the 
      dissiness
      
       in my head but to day i feel entirely free from it."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00280_n4">4. A Washington acquaintance,
      Mary Mix was first mentioned in Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00280_n5">5. Probably a nephew of
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, he was listed as a "teamster" in the 1869 Washington
      Directory. "Jo. Velsor," mentioned in Walt Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman as a driver in the
      Quartermaster Department, was probably a brother.<a href="#r5">[back]

      Whitman lived with his mother in Brooklyn. He was an inspector for Moses Lane,
      chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works (for Lane, see Walt Whitman's  letter to Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman). On , Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman wrote to Walt Whitman: "Mr Lane makes strait for george [when there is
      trouble]. Jeff says george 
      needent
      
       be uneasy about being discharged as long as lane is there." George
      continued to build houses on speculation.<a href="#r7">[back]
