   <p>I send you the picture according to promise.<sup><a href="#med.00696_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> There is
      nothing very new or special at the house since you leftâ€”nor with me either. I am
      writing this at my desk in the Attorney General's office, by a great open window,
      looking south, away down the Potomac, &amp; across to Virginia, along Arlington Heights.
