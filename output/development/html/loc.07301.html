   <p>So our old dear friend O'Connor<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r2">2</a></sup> is gone at last.<sup><a href="#loc.07622_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Thank God that he died peacefully,<sup><a href="#loc.07301_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> without pain.<sup><a href="#loc.02978_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> My
      great regret is that with his magnificent abilities he should have done so
      comparatively little to keep his name alive. However he will be long
      remembered—if for nothing else—for the "Good Gray Poet" which will not
      be forgotten for a while yet.<sup><a href="#loc.07301_n3" id="r6">6</a></sup> His death will be a great
      grief and also a great relief to Mrs O'C.<sup><a href="#n4137" id="r7">7</a></sup> The care of him was
      almost more than she could bear. She will of course grieve bitterly but for her sake
      I am glad his life was not prolonged if it had been she must have broken down and
      that would have made
      things worse than ever. I believe, dear Walt, that it is all right and as it should
      be—and I trust when I come to die myself, as I must and ought in a little
      while, that I shall say the same thing. "We shall go to him though he will not come
      back to us" and when we <u>do</u> go to him we shall see that
      there things are better managed than they would be if we had our way with them.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mrs O'Reilly (wife of the Inspector of Asylums) died yesterday morning—I go to
      Toronto to the funeral tomorrow—back next day.
   </p>
   
   <p>So we go one after the other—but it is all right—what good would it be to
      stay?

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="loc.07622_n2">3. Ellen O'Connor wrote on
       to deliver the sad news of the
      death of her husband, William. For Bucke's reaction to the death of O'Connor,

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07301_n3">6. Both Whitman and Bucke
      highly valued O'Connor's polemical writings on the poet. Bucke reprinted them in
      his biography of the poet, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (1883): "Mr.
      O'Connor's Letter, 1883," 73–98; <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html"><em>The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</em></a>,
      99–130; and "Two Subsequent Letters," 130–132. See also Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.36.html">Monday, May 13, 1889</a>.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">7. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
