      <br></br>My dear young man,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letters have been most welcome to me—welcome to me as Person, &amp; then as
      Author—I don't know which most—You did well to write to me so unconventionally,
      so fresh, so manly, &amp; so affectionately too. I too hope (though it is not probable)
      that
      we shall one day personally meet each other. Meantime I send you my friendship &amp; thanks.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Edward Dowden's<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r3">3</a></sup> letter containing among others your subscription for a
      copy of my new edition, has just been rec'd. I shall send the books very soon by express
      in
      a package to his address. I have just written to E. D.<sup><a href="#uva.00372_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My physique is entirely shatter'd—doubtless permanently—from paralysis &amp;
      other ailments. But I am up &amp; dress'd, &amp; get out every day a little—live here
      quite lonesome, but hearty, &amp; good spirits. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Write to me again. </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="uva.00372_n1">1. This letter's envelope bears the address,
      "Abraham Stoker | 119 Lower Baggot street | Dublin, | Ireland." It is
      postmarked:"Camden | Mar | 6 | N.J."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="uva.00372_n2">2. Stoker (1847–1912) was the author of
      <em>Dracula</em>, secretary to Sir Henry Irving, and editor of
      <em>Personal Reminiscences of Henry Irving</em> (1906). As a
      young man, on February 18, 1872, Stoker wrote a personal, eccentric letter to
      Walt Whitman which he did not send until . In the earlier letter he had written: "How sweet a thing it is
      for a strong healthy man with a woman's eyes and a child's wishes to feel that
      he can speak so to a man [Walt Whitman] who can be if he wishes, father, and
      brother and wife to his soul." Stoker visited Walt Whitman in 1884 (Gay Wilson
      Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
      516).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0199">3. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
