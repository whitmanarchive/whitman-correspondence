   <p>I have said that I would not write to you any more (until you wrote to me), but I

      morning [illegible] Lucas<sup><a href="#n3002" id="r2">2</a></sup> stoped me as I was coming from the pond with a pail of watter (on my way to the Station) and asked me how I would like to come over to his office
      and help the boys with the books and do the letters myself. I said I [illegible] like to come and he talked [illegible] asked me several questions which I answered to suit him and then he asked me to come
      over during the day and he would talk farther
      
      
      
      [illegible] the subject, so when I got there he said that he would give me $50 for one year and
      board myselfe in the meantime he went away and left me with the boys, so when I came away they
      asked me if I would come back [illegible] that I would see Mr. Lucas at the [illegible] in the morning and give him [illegible] my answer was no, of corse, I told him that I could not work for any less than
      
      
      
      my board he did not think I could earn that I guess for he left me and went home.
      The result was this he refuses to let me practice in his line. What do you think of

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0590">1. Walt Whitman met the 18-year-old Harry Lamb Stafford
      (b. 1858) in 1876, beginning a relationship which was almost entirely overlooked
      by early Whitman scholarship, in part because Stafford's name appears nowhere in
      the first six volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>—though it does appear frequently in the last three
      volumes, which were published only in the 1990s. Whitman occasionally referred
      to Stafford as "My (adopted) son" (as in a , letter to John H. Johnston), but the relationship between the
      two also had a romantic, erotic charge to it. For further discussion of
      Stafford, see Arnie Kantrowitz, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_55.html">Stafford, Harry L. (b.1858)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n3002">2. John Lucas was a manufacturer of
      paint with a store at 1028 Race Street in Philadelphia. Lucas and his wife were
      active in numerous professional and philanthropic organizations. A week after
      Harry's letter, John became a member of the <em>Philadelphia
         Society for Organizing Charitable Relief and Repressing Mendicancy</em>
      while his wife was later elected president of <em>The Women's Silk
         Culture Association of the United States</em>. The Lucas family had a zinc
      and color works near Kirkwood; see <em>Proceedings of the New
         Jersey Historical Society</em>, 66 (October 1948), 148.<a href="#r2">[back]
