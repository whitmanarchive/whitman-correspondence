   <p>I would ask of you the favor to see, if convenient, whether the enclosed article (The
      American War) 
      would be available for the <em>Academy</em>—(or any where else if you think preferable.) I would like pay for it—would be satisfied
      with 25, or $30.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am getting along much the same. My new book wont be out yet, publicly, for a month.

         I also send a little hitherto unpublished poem, <em>The Man-of-War Bird</em>—which I can't sell here—I wonder if you could sell it for me, 
         in London? It is not in my new book, &amp; is entirely fresh.

   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
