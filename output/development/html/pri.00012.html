      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr. Rosetti :<sup xmlns=""><a href="#pri.00012_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose Mr. Conway has received, &amp; you have read, 
      the letter I sent over about three weeks since, 
      assenting to the substitution of other words, &amp;c. 
      as proposed by you, in your reprint of my book, or selections therefrom.<sup><a href="#pri.00012_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I suppose the reprint intends to avoid any expressed or 
      implied character of being an expurgated edition. 
      I hope it will simply assume the form &amp; name of a selection 
      from the various editions of my pieces printed here. 
      I suggest, in the interest of that view, whether the 
      adjoining might not be a good form of Title page:<sup><a href="#pri.00012_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish particularly not only that the little figures 
      numbering the stanzas, but also that the larger figures 
      dividing the pieces into separate passages or sections 
      be carefully followed &amp; preserved, as in copy.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When I have my next edition brought out here, 
      I shall change the title of the piece "When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd,"
      
      to <em>President Lincoln's Funeral Hymn</em>.<sup><a href="#pri.00012_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      You are at liberty to take the latter name, or the 
      old one, at your option, (that is, if you include the piece.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is quite certain that I shall add to my next edition 
      (carrying out my plan from the first,) a brief cluster 
      of pieces, born of thoughts on the deep themes of Death &amp; Immortality.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Allow me to send you an article I have written on "Democracy"—a hasty charcoal-sketch
      of a piece, but indicative, 
      to any one interested in Leaves of Grass, as of the audience the book supposes, 
      &amp; in whose interest it is made. I shall probably send it next mail.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Allow me also to send you (as the ocean-postage law is now so easy,) 
      a copy of Mr. Burroughs's <em>Notes</em>,<sup><a href="#pri.00012_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> 
      &amp; some papers. They go same mail with this.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now, my dear sir, you must just make what use—or no use at all—of any thing I
      suggest or send—as your occasions call for. 
      Very likely some of my suggestions have been anticipated.
      
   </p>

      I remain, believe me, with friendliest feelings &amp; wishes,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="pri.00012_n1">1. This letter is Walt
      Whitman's first to William Michael Rossetti, whose name he consistently
      misspelled.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00012_n2">2. See Walt Whitman's  letter to Moncure D. Conway for a
      fuller explanation of the kinds of changes Rossetti had suggested.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00012_n3">3. 
      Whitman included with this letter a sketched mock-up of the proposed title
      page. Whitman suggested the page read, "WALT WHITMAN'S | POEMS | Selected
      from the American | Editions | By Wm. M. 
      Rosetti
      
      ."<br><br>
      On , Rossetti wrote to Whitman:
      "The form of title-page which you propose would of course be adopted by me
      with thanks &amp; without a moment's debate, were it not that my own
      title-page was previously in print." <a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00012_n4">4. Rossetti agreed to this
      change on : "I had previously
      given it a title of my own, 'Nocturn for the Death of Lincoln'." See
      "Postscript" to <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/rossetti.html">Poems by Walt Whitman</a></em> (London, John Camden Hotten, 1868),
      402.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00012_n5">5. Rossetti had seen the
      proofs of Burroughs' pamphlet in April; see Walt Whitman's  letter to Abby H. Price.<a href="#r5">[back]
