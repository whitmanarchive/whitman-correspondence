   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1043">1. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n2002">3. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">4. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

   <p id="n0119">5. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="n4319">7. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r7">[back]
