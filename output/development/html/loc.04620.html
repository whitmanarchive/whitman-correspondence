      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>your copy of Poems is at hand in good condition, with your Note of the 15th Inst.</p>
   
   <p>In complyance I enclose and mail to your addres a Post order for three dollars.</p>
   
   <p>Now Sir; as I have purchased a copy of your Poems, will you please inform me by return
      mail how far you can trace back your genealogy. I have a pamphlet which goes back
      eight generations to the first Whitman that came from England to America.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mr [
      <span class="unclear">Farnam?</span>]
       of New Haven is now getting up a more general and complete [
      <span class="unclear">one?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had an Uncle John (a [illegible]) who lived in New York. (Levi and Elinor) who lived in Massachusetts, and Josiah,
      who died in Michigan over 90 years old, leaving several sons.
   </p>
   
   <p>When I hear of one bearing the name it is always gratifying to me to know which branch
      they descended from.
   </p>
