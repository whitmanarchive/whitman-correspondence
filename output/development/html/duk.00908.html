   <p>It is dark &amp; I have had my dinner &amp; am sitting by the fire &amp; gas light—anchor'd &amp;
      tied in my old big democratic chair &amp; room, the same as all summer, now in the fall
      &amp; soon the long winter &amp; (if I live) probably through all—I have been occupied most
      of the afternoon writing my autographs—there are to be 600 for the Edition of my

      revisions (no changes at all, but a few misprints, brokennesses, &amp; errors
      corrected)—will be an <em>authenticated</em> ed'n—You shall have one—I will send one when
      ready—It is slow, but I am in no hurry.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4151">1. Whitman wanted to publish a "big
      book" that included all of his writings, and, with the help of Horace Traubel,
      he made the presswork and binding decisions for the volume. Frederick Oldach
      bound Whitman's <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), which
      included a profile photo of the poet on the title page. The book was published
      in December 1888. For more information on the book, see Ed Folsom's <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/anc.00150.html">Whitman Making Books/Books Making Whitman: A Catalog and

      Whitman admirer C. Sadakichi Hartmann.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="n2002">4. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">5. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="duk.00908_n3">6. Burroughs wrote from West
      Park, New York on  after his
      return from the seashore (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.95.html">Wednesday, October 17, 1888</a>).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">7. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="duk.00908_n4">8. George Ellis' <em>Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances</em> first
      appeared in the Bohn edition in 1848. See Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.6.html">Friday, July 20, 1888</a>.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07531_n4">9. Whitman is referring to
      Julia Pardoe's <em>Louis the Fourteenth and the Court of France in
         the Seventeenth Century</em> (1855). See Whitman's letter of  to Richard Maurice
      Bucke.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4301">10. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881)
      was a Scottish essayist, historian, lecturer, and philosopher. For more on
      Carlyle, see John D. Rosenberg, <em>Carlyle and the Burden of
         History</em> (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1985).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6168">11. Whitman is probably referring to
      Jane Carlyle Welsh (1801–1866), Thomas Carlyle's wife, and to reading the
      volume that collects her correspondence. The book is entitled <em>Letters and Memorials of Jane Carlyle Welsh</em>. It was edited by James
      Anthony Froude (and prepared for publication by Thomas Carlyle), and published
      in 1883 by by Charles Scribner's Sons.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyu.00005_n2">12. Whitman refers here to
      John Addington Symonds' <em>Studies of the Greek Poets</em>
      (London: Smith, Elder, &amp; Co., 1873–1876), in which Whitman was lauded
      as "more thoroughly Greek than any man of modern times."<a href="#r12">[back]
