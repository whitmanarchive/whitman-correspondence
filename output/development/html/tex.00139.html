      <br></br><br></br>Dear Father &amp; Comrade
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received yours of Dec 17th [lost letter] and as always will be the case was glad
      to hear from you  I have delayed answering your last a day or two for this reason.
      I have been very busy and shall write but little this time as I must go once to a
      place called West Jersey about ten miles from here to see about buying a house and
      lot but do not think that because I write but little I am tired of writing to you
      or wish to stop corresponding with you for I know of no one's letters that are looked
      for and read with more interest than yours, now that Mary has come. She came down
      on tuesday  she is well though tired when she arrived  she sends her love to you give my respects
      to all friends and write soon I will write again soon yours ever
   </p>

      Union soldier in the Third Infantry Wisconsin. At the time of his enlistment in
      May 1861, he resided in Buena Vista, Wisconsin. According to the "Notebook:
      Septemberâ€“October, 1863" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Fox was brought
      to Armory Square Hospital on September 26, 1863; it was here where he met Walt
      Whitman. He was discharged from the Union army on November 10, 1863, due to
