   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02835_n1">1. This postcard bears
      the address, "John Swinton | 124 East 38th st | New York City." It is
      postmarked: "Camden | May | 31 | N.J.<br><br>
      Though the text of this postcard is not helpful, it seems to refer to
      Swinton's support of Walt Whitman's 1876 edition; see Whitman's  and  letters to Swinton. (This postcard also resembles Whitman's
       postcard to Edmund W. Gosse
      in appearance and in handwriting.)<a href="#r1">[back]
