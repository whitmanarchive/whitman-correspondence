   <p>Friend Walter: I did not answer your last letter because I could not reply to the
      questions it put. I have heard since that Emerson tried to have something done about
      you, but failed. Believing that he would write to you, I didn't.
   </p>
   
   <p>There is a prejudice agst you here among the "fine" ladies &amp; gentlemen of the transcendental School. It is
      believed that you are not ashamed of your reproductive organs, and, somehow, it wd seem to be the result of their logic—that eunuchs only are fit for nurses. If you
      are ready to qualify yourself for their sympathy &amp; support, that you may not unnecessarily
      suffer therefrom, is the sincere wish of your friend,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath
      (1833–1891) was the author of <em>The Public Life of Capt.
         John Brown</em> (Boston: Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the
      <em>New York Tribune</em> during the war, the originator of
      the "Lyceum" lectures, and editor of the <em>North American
         Review</em> in 1886. He met Whitman in Boston in 1860 (Thomas Biggs Harned
      Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress, Notebook #90) and remained
      an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em>, ed. Sculley Bradley (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914),
      3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp."
      See also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins,
      1926).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01008_n2">1. Redpath's article appeared
      in the April 10, 1863, edition of Boston's <em>Commonwealth</em>
      (2). The complete text reads: 
       "One of the most beloved and tender hearted of the visitors at the
      hospitals in Washington, is Walt. Whitman, author of Leaves of Grass. However
      his "barbaric yawp" may sound over other roofs, it sends sweet music into the
      sick wards of the Capital. A gentleman who accompanied him on several of his
      visits, relates that his coming was greeted by the soldiers with unvarying
      pleasure, and that he soothed the homesick boys so often seen there, with a
      tenderness that no woman could excel. His friends say that he cured one or two
      young soldiers who were dying of homesickness, by his sympathy and
      loving-kindness. Dying of homesickness is no figure of speech, but a reality of
      weekly occurrence in our army. To such invalids the religious tract, or the
      mechanical consolations of theology, give no relief; not musty manna from the
      church wilderness, but living waters of sympathy from the warm heart of man who
      loves them is what they need to save them. And this they get from the rough
      singer of Brooklyn. Walt. like other poets, is not excessively rich, and
      therefore may not stay in Washington much longer; but as long as he can afford
      to remain he means to keep at his self-elected and unpaid post, doing good to
      the sick and wounded. What a pity that when so many thousands of dollars are
      spent to but little purpose for this work that a hundred or two could not be
      devoted to retain this efficient volunteer."<a href="#r1">[back]
