      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Here we are yet in camp just the same as you left us, and I think by the appearance
      of things here we are likely to stay for some time. I have my log hut partly finished
      and should have had it completed long ago, but after I had cut the logs and had them
      brought here, orders came for us to be ready to move the next day so I used the logs
      for fire wood, and since then, the weather has been so stormy I could not do much
      to it. I suppose we will go on picket tomorrow, so that I wont have a chance to do
      anything to the house untill Wednesday, but I shall finish it this week, and as soon as I get it done, I want
      you to come down and see me. Frank Butler<sup><a href="#duk.00336_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is helping me build it and is to occupy apartments in it. Your last letter to me
      is dated Jan 27th. You speak of haveing sent one the previous Saturday, encloseing one from home, and some money. I have not received it. I got a letter from Mother
      a day or two ago. She says they are all getting along after the old sort. Han has
      not got home yet, but Mother says she expects her before a great while.
   </p>
   
   <p>We had a regular old Northern snow storm last week, but it is nearly gone now but
      the mud is quite plenty just about hear. Capt Sims tells me to night that he has been
      promised a leave of absence for 10 days and will probaly start for Brooklyn in a day or two &nbsp;I suppose he will call on you in Washington.<sup><a href="#duk.00336_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> As soon as he gets back, I shall apply, and if I dont get it I dont know but I will send in my resignation &nbsp;as it is hardly a fair shake for some to
      go home two or three times a year while others cant get away at all, but I dont blame Sims at all for going whenever he can get a chance.
   </p>
   
   <p>Walt I think you had better write on to Mother and let her send you (by express) $20
      of my money and bring it on here to me when you come, for if I go home I shall want
      it, as I may not have a chance to get my pay in Washington.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tom<sup><a href="#duk.00336_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> recd. a letter from you to night. Write as soon as you get this. Good night &nbsp; &nbsp; G.W.W.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
