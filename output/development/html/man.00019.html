      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A friend of yours in Boston sends through me a little New Years gift.<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> It comes from a
      good fellow. I wish I could duplicate it. I went over to Boston to the Holmes<sup><a href="#n3024" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      breakfast &amp; had a pleasant time, I saw Emerson &amp; spoke with him. He seemed
      to grope about in his mind for some clew as to who I was, but I hardly
      think he placed me, though I told him the names of my books. There seems to be a
      fearful chasm in his mind &amp; he is hardly able to bridge it over, in conversation.
      He does not remember the name of his own State. Whittier<sup><a href="#n1029" id="r3">3</a></sup> was standing by him &amp;
      hearing my name, said to Emerson, "oh! thee knows him" with much emphasis. I
      then spoke to Whittier: he seemed to know me well &amp; said he had read all I had
      published &amp; was complimentary. Emerson is thin &amp; sharp &amp; his hair is
      about gone. He seemed to eat well &amp; to enjoy the fun. He wears the same look as of
      old. Holmes greeted me very heartily &amp; said many pleasant things to me. Fields<sup><a href="#n0231b" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      was very cordial &amp; wanted me to stay at his house, a Mrs Fairchilds asked to be
      introduced to me to tell me how much she admired you &amp; your poems &amp;c. I went
      out to Arlington &amp; saw Trowbridge<sup><a href="#n0860" id="r5">5</a></sup> He is well &amp; made many inquiries about
      you. He has several children by his second wife, &amp; they have a pleasant home.—I
      am making trips to 
      N.Y. 
      now adays
      
       to be treated for my arm &amp; hand. The Doctor says it is
      Neuritis, inflammation of the nerves of the arm. He cauterizes my back &amp;
      arm with a red hot piece of platinum. I go again in the morning &amp; shall stay
      down several days. The rest are all well here. I send the baby's picture taken in
      October. He runs all about now &amp; begins to talk; Smith &amp; his family are
      well. Mother mends a little. We have had a touch of winter here, &amp; the river is
      frozen over, but to-day it is thawing again. Write, I hope you are coming East
      soon.
   </p>

      With much love from us all &amp; a happy new year to you,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3024">2. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.
      (1809–1894) was a Bostonian author, physician, and lecturer. One of the
      Fireside Poets, he was a good friend of Ralph Waldo Emerson as well as John
      Burroughs. Towards Whitman's poetry, Holmes remained ambivalent. He married
      Amelia Lee Jackson in 1840 and they had three children, including the later
      Supreme Court judge Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. For more information, see
      "Holmes, Oliver Wendell (1809-1894)," (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, eds. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 280).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1029">3. John Greenleaf Whittier
      (1807–1892) earned fame as a staunch advocate for the abolition of
      slavery. As a poet, he employed traditional forms and meters, and, not
      surprisingly, he was not an admirer of Whitman's unconventional prosody. For
      Whitman's view of Whittier, see the poet's numerous comments throughout the nine
      volumes of Horace Traubel's <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      (various publishers: 1906–1996) and Whitman's "My Tribute to Four Poets,"
      in <em>Specimen Days</em> (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh &amp; Co.,
      1882–'83), 180–181.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0231b">4. Likely James T. Fields (1817–1881), who
      had succeeded James Russell Lowell as editor of the <em>Atlantic
         Monthly</em> in 1861 and held the position until 1871.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0860">5. John Townsend Trowbridge
      (1827–1916) was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and
      anti-slavery reformer. Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry
      in 1855, he did not meet Whitman until 1860, when the poet was in Boston
      overseeing the Thayer and Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.<a href="#r5">[back]
