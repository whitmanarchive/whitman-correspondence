      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>In no less familiar or colder terms can we bring ourselves to address you, the most
      loved of friends, though such a salutation from strangers to anyone but yourself
      would seem an impertinence
   </p>
   
   <p>We, two friends chiefly united by our common love of you, wish to congratulate you
      on
      your birthday and express to you personally our very best wishes and love. To you
      we
      owe not only affection but endless gratitude and reverence. One of us, a doctor,
      owes to you entirely his spiritual enfranchisement &amp; deliverance from
      soul-benumbing scepticism, into which, not without pain, he had gradually fallen.
      Your books are his constant companions, his spiritual nourishment, his continual
      study and delight. And not least of his debts to you is "the glory" you have shown
      him, "in his daily walk &amp; trade" which you have ennobled and made beautiful for
      him.
   </p>
   
   <p>The writer in many obstructions &amp; difficulties is strengthened and comforted by
      your example and words. In past heavy bereavement (of a mother to whom he has often
      mentally applied the words you use of yours) <u>your</u> words
      have best tallied his deepest experience and hopes. For years he has been, and is,
      a
      lover and grateful student of Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r2">2</a></sup> and, in turn, of
      Ruskin.<sup><a href="#n3013" id="r3">3</a></sup> He has also, on the  other hand been long familiar with
      Emerson<sup><a href="#n0218" id="r4">4</a></sup> and reveres his memory. But <u>your</u> teaching, far more than Emerson's, has appealed to him as the fitting
      offset to and complement of theirs, and as a veritable "Gospel" bringing "glad
      tidings of great joy."
   </p>
   
   <p>We both study your writings as much as possible, and glean every help that critiques
      and notices can give. We endeavor to assimilate them in our lives and try to
      introduce them to others. We occasionally call friends together in your name to
      spend "a Whitman evening", to read your books and talk about them. We shall not fail
      to do so on the 31st, and shall rejoice to believe that you know it and that there
      is a <u>real</u> communion between us, though far sundered
   </p>
   
   <p>We are anxious to have the pleasure of giving you some little tangible token of our
      love. We do not know what else to send you so venture to ask you to accept a money
      present of £10. It will be a lifelong pleasure to us to feel that we have thus been
      in personal communication with you and that something you hold has been supplied by
      <u>us</u>.
   </p>
   
   <p>Hoping you will do us this favour, and wishing you long continued health and
      strength. We are,
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours gratefully and affectionately
      <br></br>John Johnston M.D.
      <br></br>J. W. Wallace.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04404_n1">1. The address is written on
      the verso of this letter. The town name "Bolton" is linked to both Johnston's
      and Wallace's address via a bracket.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0139">2. Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) was a Scottish
      writer who wrote frequently on the conflict between scientific changes and the
      traditional social (often religious) order. For Whitman's writings on Carlyle in
      <em>Specimen Days</em>, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf087v1">Death of Thomas Carlyle</a>" and "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf088v1">Carlyle from American Points of View</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3013">3. John Ruskin (1819–1900) was
      one of the leading art critics in Victorian Great Britain. Whitman sent <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and a "couple of photographs" to Ruskin
      via William Harrison Riley in March 1879 (see the letter from Whitman to Riley
      of ). Ruskin, according to Whitman,
      expressed "<em>worry</em> [...] that [<em>Leaves</em> is] <em>too personal</em>, too emotional,
      launched from the fires of [...] spinal passions, joys, yearnings" (see the
      letter from Whitman to William O'Connor of ). Whitman, late in life, said to Horace Traubel: "[I] take my
      Ruskin with some qualifications." Still, Ruskin "is not to be made little of: is
      of unquestionable genius and nobility" (Horace Traubel, <em>With
         Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/4/med.00004.4.html">Thursday, January 24, 1889</a>).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0218">4. Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–1882) was an
      American poet and essayist who began the Transcendentalist movement with his
      1836 essay <em>Nature</em>. On , Whitman informed Ralph Waldo Emerson that "" was "put in type for my own convenience,
      and to ensure greater correctness." He asked Emerson to take the poem to James
      T. Fields, editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, who promptly
      accepted it and published it in February 1869. For more on Emerson, see Jerome
      Loving, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_1.html">Emerson, Ralph Waldo [1809–1882]</a>," <em>Walt
