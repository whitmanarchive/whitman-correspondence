   <p>Your letter of 12th<sup><a href="#loc.07126_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came to hand yesterday—Shall we
      soon have a chance of seeing the "Annex"—"Good bye My Fancy"?<sup><a href="#loc.07126_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> This then I suppose is to be the end of the glorious
      Leaves? Well they are pretty complete—I hardly know what could be added with
      advantage. Next thing will be to incorporate the two annexes into the body of the
      book so as to make of it what it is—a unit.

   <p>Have you seen Dr. Thomas yet? has he order'd glasses for you and have you got

      new glasses and whether they do not make you more comfortable. As for that infernal

   <p>Surely you must need some medicine and you could not go far wrong to take say six

      Friedrichshall—unless you are a great deal better I advise you either to do
      this or send for a doctor—there is no use suffering more than can be
      helped.

   <p>I enclose a letter just came from Wallace<sup><a href="#n6121" id="r6">6</a></sup>—want you to

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n6121">6. James William Wallace
      (1853–1926), of Bolton, England, was an architect and great admirer of
      Whitman. Along with John Johnston (d. 1918), a physician from Bolton, he founded
      the "Bolton College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace
      corresponded with Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the
      Whitman circle in the United States, and they separately visited the poet and
      published memoirs of their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire
         Friends</em> (London: Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on
      Wallace, see Larry D. Griffin, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_65.html">Wallace, James William (1853–1926)</a>," <em>Walt
