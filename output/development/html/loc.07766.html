   <p>Bad night ag'n—heavy tussel strangling spell (phlegm &amp;c) bet. 12 and
      1—&amp; more or less all night but fell asleep utterly worried &amp; tired out
      toward morning—must have had sleep of a couple of hours—A suspicion of
      better, very faint but palpable, this forenoon—ate all my breakfast (egg,
      toast, coffee &amp; dab of raspberry) for the first time in three weeks—&amp;
      have a slight glint of strength instead of the deadly weakness &amp; inertia of past
      month—head ache all the forenoon—rather pleasant day, sun out most of
      the time—anxious abt my Tuesday evn'g engagement<sup><a href="#loc.07766_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      next, want much to carry it out—but very uncertain as I write—Y'rs of

      visitors—y'rs of even'g 9th<sup><a href="#loc.07766_n5" id="r10">10</a></sup> just
      rec'd—thanks—have not had any doctor in yet &amp; probably will
      not—what I have is mainly an expansion &amp; perhaps concentration of my long
      long chronic botherations, bad enough before &amp; when <em>this</em>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07761_n3">4. <em>Giordano Bruno: Philosopher and Martyr</em> (1890) consisted of two
      speeches before the Philadelphia Contemporary Club by Daniel G. Brinton
      (1837-1899), a pioneer in the study of anthropology, and by Thomas Davidson. It
      included a prefatory note by Whitman dated 24 February 1890 (see <em>The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman: Prose Works 1892</em>,
      ed. by Floyd Stovall, 2 vols. (1963-1964), 676-677). In his essay Brinton links
      the poet with Bruno in his rejection of the "Christian notion of sin as a
      positive entity" (34). On April 4, Whitman sent copies of the book to Symonds,
      Tennyson, Sarrazin, Rolleston, and W. M. Rossetti (<em>The
         Commonplace-Book</em>, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839-1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's
       letter to Bucke. After the poet
      presented him with a copy of <em>Complete Poems &amp; Prose</em>,
      Brinton expressed his thanks effusively on .<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="n0129">5. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n1043">6. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="n4979">9. Robert Pearsall Smith
      (1827–1898) was a Quaker who became an evangelical minister associated
      with the "Holiness movement." He was also a writer and businessman. Whitman
      often stayed at his Philadelphia home, where the poet became friendly with the
      Smith children—Mary, Logan, and Alys. For more information about Smith,
