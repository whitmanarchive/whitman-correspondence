      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Monday February 6, 1865.
      
      <br></br><br></br>My dear Friend:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As you see by the date of this, I am back again in Washington, moving around regularly,
      but not to excess, among the hospitals. . . . My health is pretty good, but since
      I was prostrated last July, I have not had that unconscious and perfect health I formerly
      had. The physician says my system has been penetrated by the malaria—it is tenacious,
      peculiar and somewhat baffling—but tells it will go over in due time. It is my first
      appearance in the character of a man not entirely well.
   </p>
   
   <p>The talk here is about the late Peace Conference<sup><a href="#loc.00307_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the general statement accepted is that it has been a failure and a bubble—even the
      war is to go on worse than ever—but I find a few shrewd persons whose theory is that
      it is not at all sure of its being a failure—they say that the President and Mr. Seward
      are willing to avoid at present the tempest of rage which would beat about their heads,
      if it were known among the Radicals that Peace, Amnesty, <em>every thing</em>, were given up to the Rebels on the single price of re-assuming their place in the
      Union—so the said shrewd ones say the thing is an open question yet. For <em>my</em> part I see no light or knowledge in any direction on the matter of the conference,
      or what it amounted to, or where it left off. I say nothing, and have no decided opinion
      about it—not even a guess (but rather leaning to the generally accepted statement
      above).
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear friend, I haven't your last letter at hand to see whether there is anything
      that needs special answer—I hope to hear from you often. For the present Farewell.
   </p>

   <p>Direct to me simply Washington, D. C., as I call for my letters daily at the post
      office. Should you have an opportunity to see Dr. Le Baron Russell,<sup><a href="#loc.00307_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> 3 Mt. Vernon St., tell him I wished you to thank him for many favors and contributions
      to the men in times past, and that I am now back in Washington. If perfectly eligible,
      it might help me in the cause of the men, if you were to prepare a paragraph for Mr.
      Shillaber's paper,<sup><a href="#loc.00307_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> if he were willing to publish it, stating that I am now as a volunteer nurse among
      the Hospitals at Washington &amp; in the field as formerly. Write soon as convenient.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Townsend Trowbridge
      was a novelist, poet, author of juvenile stories, and antislavery reformer.
      Though Trowbridge became familiar with Whitman's poetry in 1855, he did not meet
      Whitman until 1860 when the poet was in Boston overseeing the Thayer and
      Eldridge edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He again met Whitman
      in Washington in 1863, when Trowbridge stayed with Treasury Secretary Salmon P.
      Chase in order to gather material for his biography, <em>The Ferry
         Boy and the Financier</em> (Boston: Walker and Wise, 1864); he described
      their meetings in <em>My Own Story</em>, (Boston: Houghton and
      Mifflin, 1903), 360–401, with recollections of noted persons. On December
      11, 1862, Trowbridge had presented to Chase Emerson's letter recommending
      Whitman; see Emerson's letter from . Though Trowbridge was not an idolator of Whitman, he wrote to
      William D. O'Connor in 1867: "Every year confirms my earliest impression, that
      no book has approached the power and greatness of this book, since the Lear and
      Hamlet of Shakespeare" (Rufus A. Coleman, "Trowbridge and O'Connor," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 [1951–52], 327). For
      Whitman's high opinion of Trowbridge, see Horace Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.71.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996), 3:506. See
      also Coleman, "Trowbridge and Whitman," <em>PMLA</em>, 63 (1948),
      262–273. For several weeks in 1863, Trowbridge stayed with Whitman in
      Washington, D.C., along with John Burroughs and William D. O'Connor.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00307_n2">1. On
      February 3, 1865, Lincoln and his Secretary of State Wiliam H. Seward met with
      Vice-President of the Confederacy Alexander H. Stephens on the Union transport
      <em>River Queen</em> lying in Hampton Roads. All through 1864
      Lincoln had insisted that he would consider any peace plan that included
      restoration of the Union <em>and</em> the emancipation of all
      slaves; he now also demanded a complete end to the war, refusing to consider a
      temporary cessation of hostilities. Lincoln's last requirement frustrated the
      Southerners' desire for an armistice, which would, they hoped, allow for a
      cooling of passions before the beginning of negotiations. The meeting ended with
      no agreement reached.<a href="#r1">[back]
