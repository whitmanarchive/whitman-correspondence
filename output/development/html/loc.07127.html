   <p>Many thanks, dear Walt, for the two bundles of papers received yesterday and
      to-day—the one containing "Liberty" "N.Y. World" and cuttings and the other
      the "Critic" of 21 Dec. 89. All welcome but especially the "World" with its curious
      "obituary" of Walt Whitman "the American Dante, Aeschylus or Shakespeare" printed
      in
      '71 and which I had never seen before or even heard of. It is a most valuable item
      for my collection and will be valued beyond most old newspapers.<sup><a href="#loc.07127_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> How is the abdominal pain? wearing away I hope? or have
      you seen any doctor about it?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We are all well here—beautiful weather most of the time—has been a
      charming day and is now a lovely moonlight night
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
