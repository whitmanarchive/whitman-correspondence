   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00176_n15">1. This letter dates to
      between May 13 and May 18, 1868. The executors did not date this letter, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller did not list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:366). The letter dates to the removal of Samuel H.
      Roberts as the Brooklyn postmaster, which was reported on May 12, 1868, and
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman paraphrased the article on his removal. Louisa also
      acknowledged Walt's most recent letter (not extant) on Tuesday, probably May 12,
      1868. Her references to the "president question," which may refer to the
      impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson or to the expected nomination of Ulysses S.
      Grant as the Republican candidate at the Chicago Convention, corroborate the
      month and year but are too general to establish a particular date.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n3">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n12">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      refers to the <em>Illustrated Chicago News</em>, a periodical
      published by A. M. Farnum and C. A. Church that began a brief run on April 24,
      1868 (see Frank W. Scott and Edmund Janes James, ed., <em>Newspapers and Periodicals of Illinois, 1814–1879</em> [Springfield:
      Illinois State Historical Library, 1910], 92).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="tex.00176_n21">4. Walt Whitman's May 11? or
      18?, 1868 (Monday) letter is not extant. Edwin Haviland Miller did not list it
      among Walt's lost letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:361).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n1">5. Postmaster Samuel H. Roberts
      was removed from office and replaced by Joseph M. Simonson because the former
      "has been unpleasantly short, and for some reason has been unable to send
      forward the balances due the government" ("Removal of the Postmaster," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 12, 1868, 3).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n3">6. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson
      "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters,
      Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St.
      Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>
      (New York: New York University Press, 1977), 1–26.<br><br>
      Later, in a portion of her letter written the next day, Louisa acknowledged
      receipt of a letter from Mattie and one from Jeff. Neither letter is extant.
      Mattie in her June 8, 1868 letter wrote, "It is a long time since I wrote to
      you" (Waldron, 54).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n4">7. Moses Lane (1823–1882)
      served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862 to 1869. He later
      designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served there as city
      engineer. Lane helped to further the careers both of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman as an engineer and George Washington Whitman as a pipe inspector. That
      connection was especially useful for George's career: "jeff says as long as lane
      is in the [Brooklyn] water works georgey will be" (see Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's  letter to Walt
      Whitman). Lane resigned as Chief Engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works in 1869,
      and he soon became City Engineer of Milwaukee ("Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers</em> [February
      1882], 58).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">8. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00550_n4">9. Charles L. Heyde
      (1822–1892) a landscape painter, married Hannah Louisa Whitman
      (1823–190), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's second daughter, and they lived in
      Burlington, Vermont.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n16">10. The "president question"
      was before the Chicago Republican Convention, which nominated Ulysses S. Grant.
      Though widely viewed as the only probable candidate, Grant had signaled his
      unwillingness to be nominated while the impeachment trial of President Andrew
      Johnson remained unresolved ("Gen. Grant Declares," <em>Brooklyn
         Daily Eagle</em>, May 13, 1868, 2).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">11. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n11">12. This passage can be
      clarified by recalling Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's political sympathies. Her
      loyalties were in part to Walt Whitman's employ in Washington under Republican
      presidential administrations, but she performed a complex act of mimicry. She
      dramatized for Walt in monologue form Edward "Eddy" Whitman's exchange (and his
      report of the exchange) with the unnamed Democrat. Eddy reported that the
      Democrat said, "the radicals were all down," a statement which apparently
      excited Eddy. Louisa repeated Eddy's report of the Democrat's words, and then
      she interrupted Eddy to seek clarification because she found Eddy's exasperation
      to be humorous. So "i how doo you know he is clear he said" could be rendered
      with formal punctuation and explanatory insertions as follows: "I [said], 'how
      do you know?' Eddy is clear [the democrat] said, 'it was in the eagle. . . .' It
      [Eddy's reaction] was quite amusing. . . ." Louisa derided often the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>'s boosterism for the Democratic
      party.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">13. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00176_n14">14. The letter is cut off.
      The portion that concerns "mrs glover" is not present in the continuation of
      the letter. Above, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman indicated she was out of paper.
      She may also have abandoned the thought after acquiring paper to resume the
      letter.<br><br>
      Mrs. Glover cannot be positively identified. The <em>Brooklyn
         Directory</em> (1868) lists a "David K. Glover" as an engineer in East
      Brooklyn. She may have been a spouse or other acquaintance through Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman or George Washington Whitman at the Brooklyn Water
      Works.<a href="#r14">[back]
