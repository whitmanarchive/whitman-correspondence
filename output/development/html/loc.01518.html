      <br></br><br></br>Dear Pete—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been very sick the last three days—I dont know what to call it—it makes me
      prostrated 
      &amp; deathly weak, &amp; little use of my limbs.<sup><a href="#loc.01518_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I have thought of you, my darling boy, very much of the time. 
      I have not been out of the house since the first day after my arrival. I had a pleasant
      journey 
      through on the cars Wednesday afternoon &amp; night—felt quite well then. My Mother &amp;
      folks are all well. 
      We are in our new house—we occupy part &amp; rent out part. I have a nice room, where
      I now sit writing this. 
      It is the latter part of the afternoon. I feel better the last hour or so. It has
      been extremely hot here 
      the last two days—I see it has been so in Washington too. I hope I shall get out soon.
      
      I hanker to get out doors, &amp; down the bay.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And now, dear Pete, for yourself. How is it with you, dearest boy—and is there any
      thing different with the face?<sup><a href="#loc.01518_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Dear Pete, you must forgive me for being so cold the last day &amp; evening. 
      I was unspeakably shocked and repelled from you by that talk &amp; proposition of yours—you
      know what—there by the fountain. It seemed indeed to me, (for I will talk out 
      plain to you, dearest comrade,) that the one I loved, and who had always been so manly
      
      &amp; sensible, was gone, &amp; a fool &amp; intentional murderer stood in his place. 
      I spoke so sternly &amp; cutting. (Though I see now that my words might have appeared
      
      to have a certain other meaning, which I didn't dream of, insulting to you, never
      for 
      one moment in my thoughts.) But I will say no more of this—for I know such thoughts
      must 
      have come when you was not yourself, but in a moment of derangement—&amp; have passed
      away like a bad dream.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dearest boy, I have not a doubt but you will get well, and entirely well—&amp; we will
      one day look back on these drawbacks &amp; sufferings as things long past. 
      The extreme cases of that malady, (as I told you before) are persons that have very
      
      deeply diseased blood, probably with syphilis in it, inherited from parentage, 
      &amp; confirmed by themselves—so they have no foundation to build on. <em>You</em> are of healthy stock, 
      with a sound constitution, &amp; good blood—&amp; I <em>know</em> it is impossible for it to continue long. 
      My darling, if you are not well when I come back I will get a good room or two in
      some quiet place, 
      (or out of Washington, perhaps in Baltimore,) and we will live together, &amp; devote
      ourselves 
      altogether to the job of curing you, &amp; rooting the cursed thing out entirely, 
      &amp; making you stronger &amp; healthier than ever. I have had this in my mind before, 
      but never broached it to you. I could go on with my work in the Attorney General's
      office 
      just the same—&amp; we would see that your mother should have a small sum every week to
      keep the pot a-boiling at home.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear comrade, I think of you very often. My love for you is indestructible, 
      &amp; since that night &amp; morning has returned more than before.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Pete, dear son, my darling boy, my young &amp; loving brother, don't let the devil
      
      put such thoughts in your mind again—wickedness unspeakable—murder, death &amp; disgrace
      here, 
      &amp; hell's agonies hereafter<sup><a href="#loc.01518_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—Then what would it be afterward to the mother? What to <em>me</em>?—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Pete, I send you some money, by Adam's Express—you use it, dearest son, &amp; when it
      is gone, 
      you shall have some more, for I have plenty. I will write again before long—give my
      love to Johnny Lee,<sup><a href="#loc.01518_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> my dear darling boy, I love him truly—(let him read these three last lines)—Dear
      Pete, <em>remember</em>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01518_n1">1. Walt Whitman's health had
      begun to deteriorate; he had written about a "severe cold" with "bad spells [of]
      dizziness" in his  letter
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Yet in his puff in the Washington <em>Sunday Chronicle</em> on May 9, 1869, Walt Whitman had written
      about himself: "On the verge of becoming half a centenarian, he retains his
      accustomed health, eats his rations regularly, and keeps his weight well toward
      190 pounds"; reprinted in Emory Holloway, "Whitman as His Own Press Agent," <em>American Mercury</em> 18 (1929), 482.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01518_n2">2. According to Dr. Richard
      Maurice Bucke, Doyle was suffering a skin eruption popularly known as "barber's
      itch" and was taken by Whitman to Dr. Charles Bowen for treatment; see <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em> [New York: G.P.
      Putnam's Sons, 1902], 8:40–41n. Doyle's suicidal response to the skin
      irritation was undoubtedly associated with deep-seated feelings of guilt.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01518_n3">3. In this uncharacteristic
      injunction, Walt Whitman was no doubt exploiting Doyle's Catholicism.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01518_n4">4. Probably a laborer or a
      conductor. The 1869 Directory listed, however, a number of John Lees.<a href="#r4">[back]
