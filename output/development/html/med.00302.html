      <br></br><br></br>Dear M.,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am writing this in the hospital, sitting by the side of a soldier, I do not expect
      to last many hours. His fate has been a hard one—he seems to be only about 19 or 20—Erastus
      Haskell<sup><a href="#med.00302_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup>, company K, 141st N. Y.—has been out about a year, and sick or half-sick more than
      half that time—has been down on the peninsula—was detail'd to go in the band as fifer-boy. While sick, the surgeon told him to keep up with
      the rest—(probably work'd and march'd too long.) He is a shy, and seems to me a very sensible boy—has fine manners—never
      complains—was sick down on the peninsula in old storehouse—typhoid fever. The first
      week this July was brought up here—journey very bad, no accommodations, no nourishment,
      nothing but hard jolting, and exposure enough to make a well man sick; (these fearful
      journeys do the job for many)—arrived here July 11th—a silent dark-skinn'd Spanish-looking youth, with large very dark blue eyes, peculiar looking. Doctor F.
      here made light of his sickness—said he would recover soon, &amp;c.; but I thought very
      different, and told F. so repeatedly; (I came near quarreling with him about it from
      the first)—but he laugh'd, and would not listen to me. About four days ago, I told Doctor he would in my opinion
      lose the boy without doubt—but F. again laugh'd at me. The next day he changed his opinion—I brought the head surgeon of the post—he
      said the boy would probably die, but they would make a hard fight for him.
   </p>
   
   <p>The last two days he has been lying panting for breath—a pitiful sight. I have been
      with him some every day or night since he arrived. He suffers a great deal with the
      heat—says little or nothing—is flighty the last three days, at times—knows me always,
      however—calls me "Walter"—(sometimes calls the name over and over and over again,
      musingly, abstractly, to himself.) His father lives at Breesport, Chemung county,
      N. Y., is a mechanic with large family—is a steady, religious man; his mother too
      is living. I have written to them, and shall write again to-day—Erastus has not receiv'd a word from home for months.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I sit here writing to you, M., I wish you could see the whole scene. This young
      man lies within reach of me, flat on his back, his hands clasp'd across his breast, his thick hair cut close; he is dozing, breathing hard, every
      breath a spasm—it looks so cruel. He is a noble youngster,—I consider him past all
      hope. Often there is no one with him for a long while. I am here as much as possible.
