   <p>Not knowing what they were agoing to do with me until thursday last is my excuse for not writing sooner. Thursday I expected my dischar[g]e so that
      I could start Friday but on going to the office I found that they had not yet been
      signed by Bliss you recollect that Stearns told me he knew that they had gone up and
      when the truth was known he knew nothing about it thursday afternoon my papers wer sent in to the ward for me to go before Bliss<sup><a href="#tex.00133_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> he examined me and told me I could have my papers in three days think I can start
      tuesday for home    I have got so that I am able to walk to the Sutler's and back
   </p>
   
   <p>(Walt it is useless for me to try to tell you how much i have missed you at night
      when my supper was brought in there was still something wanting that that was your
      cheerful smiling face! and then too I missed your kiss of friendship and love as also
      your kind "good night" or "So long")
   </p>
   
   <p>I should like much to have seen you again before I went home. I have some thoughts
      of going up to Annapolis before I start north but have not yet decided. please write
      as soon as you get this and direct to Portage Kalamazoo, Co. Michigan good by dear
      friend

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Elijah Douglass Fox was a
      Union soldier in the Third Infantry Wisconsin. At the time of his enlistment in
      May 1861, he resided in Buena Vista, Wisconsin. According to the "Notebook:
      September–October, 1863" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection), Fox was brought
      to Armory Square Hospital on September 26, 1863; it was here where he met Walt
      Whitman. He was discharged from the Union army on November 10, 1863, due to
      disability.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00133_n1">1. D. Willard Bliss
      (1825–1889) was a surgeon with the Third Michigan Infantry, and afterward
      in charge of Armory Square Hospital. See John Homer Bliss, <em>Genealogy of the Bliss Family in America, from about the year 1550 to
         1880</em> (Boston: John Homer Bliss, 1881), 545. He practiced medicine in
      Washington after the war; see "Letter from Walt Whitman to Hiram Sholes, May 30,
      1867" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1961], 1:331–332). When a pension
      for Whitman was proposed in the House of Representatives in 1887, Dr. Bliss was
      quoted: "I am of opinion that no one person who assisted in the hospitals during
      the war accomplished so much good to the soldiers and for the Government as Mr.
      Whitman" (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman the Man</em> [New
      York: F. P. Harper, 1896], 169).<a href="#r1">[back]
