      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rhys
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I suppose you got the copy I mail'd you some three or four days ago<sup><a href="#nyp.00581_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the
      additional matter (27 printed pages) for "Democratic Vistas"—I enclose
      herewith the MS of a little Preface. The title page ought to be 
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Democratic Vistas</em></p> 
   <p>and other Pieces</p> 
   <p>By Walt Whitman</p>
   
   <p>Leave out "Two Letters"
      (p 315 and partly on p 316)—Leave out altogether the Appendix pieces (pp 339
      to 374 inclusive)—And I should suggest to have "Notes left over" (pp 317 to
      338) come last in the volume, &amp; <em>finishing it.</em> Finally I
      give you the same privilege over the putting together of this, as my other volumes.
      (Is there any probability of a second edition of "Spec: Days"? Is it
      stereotyped?)
   </p>
   
   <p><em>To the Publisher</em>—For this Volume, the Preface, &amp;c. I
      shall expect £10:10s (same as my other vols) and also 10 copies of the "Vistas"
      <em>bound in roan</em>. I wish the am't of the bill for the 50
      copies "Spec:Days" (sent me three months ago,) deducted from the £10:10s and
      when you send the balance, send in P.O. order.
   </p>
   
   <p>Respects &amp; good will to all</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="nyp.00581_n2">2. This letter illustrates
      Walt Whitman's careful, almost obsessive, supervision of every detail of
      publication. Although he granted Rhys authority to make adjustments as needs
      arose, in actuality he restricted Rhys's freedom.<a href="#r2">[back]
