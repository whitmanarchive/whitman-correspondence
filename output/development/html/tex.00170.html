   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00170_n7">1. This letter dates to between
      July 5 and July 12, 1869. The letter has no date marking in Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's hand. The executors did not date it, and Edwin Haviland Miller did not
      list it in his calendar of letters (Walt Whitman, <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:367). Based on Louisa's expectation that fractional currency bills, which Walt
      Whitman had forwarded, would "soon be in circulation," the letter dates to early
      July 1869, perhaps a week or two before the release of Postal Currency in the
      15-cent denomination. The latest possible date, July 12, is derived both from
      Louisa's expectation that Abby and Helen Price would visit soon and that Walt
      would arrive "next month." Walt in a mid-July letter to Abby Price praised her
      daughter Helen's visit to his mother and reported that he would "leave
      Washington soon after the middle of August" (see his  letter to Abby Price). Also see Louisa's  letter to Walt, which describes the
      Price's visit the previous day.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00170_n11">3. The R. D. Wood Foundry had
      a site in Millville, New Jersey, but George Washington Whitman more often
      inspected pipe at the more recently established foundries in Camden and
      Florence, New Jersey. George accepted a position as inspector of pipes at the
      foundry in late 1869. See Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's , , and
       letters to Walt Whitman. See
      Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
      <em>Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman</em> (Durham,
      North Carolina: Duke University Press, 1975), 28.<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="tex.00170_n18">4. Only the first three
      letters of the word "much" are visible in the image. The letter is pasted into a
      manuscript book, and the final letters on the edge closest to the binding in the
      page image are often obscured. Most of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman manuscript
      letters in the bound volume entitled <em>Walt Whitman: A Series of
         Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son</em>, held at the Harry Ransom
      Center, have obscured text on at least one page. Text from this page was
      recorded based on an examination of the physical volume, which allowed more text
      to be recovered.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00170_n8">5. The United States issued
      fractional currency during the Civil War, which was known as Postal Currency
      because the designs copied postage stamps. Various issues continued to enter
      circulation until the mid-1870s. The 15 cent note appeared only in the fourth
      issue, which entered circulation on July 14, 1869, and its design is known as
      the "Bust of Columbia." See Arthur L. Friedberg and Ira S. Friedberg, <em>Paper Money of the United States: A Complete Illustrated Guide
         With Valuations,</em> 18th ed. (Clifton, New Jersey: Coin &amp; Currency
      Institute, 2006), 174, 177. If Walt Whitman acquired the notes and forwarded
      them to his mother some days before they entered official circulation, how he
      was able to do so is unknown. His close friend William D. O'Connor, who worked
      in the Treasury Department, may have had access to uncirculated currency.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00170_n3">6. According to Clara
      Barrus, after visiting Brooklyn in late June 1868, John Burroughs described
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman favorably in a letter to his wife: "A spry,
      vivacious, handsome old lady, worthy of her illustrious son" (<em>Whitman and Burroughs: Comrades</em> [Boston: Houghton
      Mifflin, 1931], 57).<br><br>
      John Burroughs (1837–1921) met Walt Whitman on the streets of
      Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn in 1864, Whitman
      commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with Burroughs.
      Burroughs wrote several books involving or devoted to Whitman's work: <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Notes on
         Walt Whitman as Poet and Person</em> (1867), <em>Whitman,
         A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the Universe</em>
      (1924). Ursula North (1836–1917) married John Burroughs in 1857 and
      also became a friend to Walt Whitman. For more on Whitman's relationship
      with the Burroughs family, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John (1837–1921) and Ursula
         (1836–1917)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="tex.00170_n4">7. For Helen Price's visit,
      see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's 
      letter to Walt Whitman. Walt wrote to Abby Price within days of this letter
      from his mother: "What a good girl Helen is, to go and make those nice calls
      on mother" (see Walt's  to Abby
      Price).<br><br>
      Helen Price was the daughter of Abby H. Price (1814–1878) and Edmund
      Price. During the 1860s, Abby and Helen were friends with Walt and Louisa,
      and the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and
      she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother (see
      "Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">8. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r8">[back]
