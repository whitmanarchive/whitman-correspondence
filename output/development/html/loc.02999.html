      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend:—
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Let me thank you now, lest I forget it, for your kind thoughtfulness in offering to
      remember me with a copy of the new flexible pocket Ed.n of L. of G.<sup><a href="#loc.02999_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> It is what I
      have long wished for. I think the value of a book of poems is many times multiplied
      by being in pocket form. I recently b't (35 cts) a copy of Rhys's<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup> Ed.n. They had no business to sell it. It came over in
      an invoice of Camelot Classics. There are no more to be had here. But it is only a
      fragment—mutilated, &amp; has mistakes in it. I bt it to lend to Whitman beginners
      &amp; weaklings. Have loaned it now to Dr. Clarence J. Blake,<sup><a href="#loc.02999_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> the finest aurist in Boston.
   </p>
   
   <p>When will the little vol. be out? My yard is looking finely. 2 doz. hyacinths
      out.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
