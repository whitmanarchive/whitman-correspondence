   <p>A pleasant forenoon as I write, here by the open window. I remain ab't as
      usual—a little pull'd down by the heat perhaps. Your letter came, &amp; was
      welcome, as always—Alys's "circular"<sup><a href="#uva.00492_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> came, &amp;
      now one from Romsey arrived this morn'g—I had a letter from Dr B[ucke] two
      days ago— all well—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
