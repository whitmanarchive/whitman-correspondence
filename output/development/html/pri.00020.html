      <br></br><br></br>Dear friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is to acknowledge yours of the 25th March—those of the 16th and of the 20th,<sup><a href="#pri.00020_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> duly rec'd, were previously acknowledged.
   </p> 
   
   <p>My letters (that of March 17, in which I outline the situation &amp; my wishes—that of
      23d, postal c'd.—that of 29th, on sending the Two Volumes, publication copy L. of G. and Two R—that of April 1 
      conveying fuller &amp; more detailed statement of views &amp; wishes—&amp; a short letter afterward,
      same date) 
      have conveyed I think substantially all I desire to say on the whole affair.<sup><a href="#pri.00020_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If the cable telegram in the evening papers of Tuesday last here correctly synopsizes
      M D Conway's 
      letter about my case in some London paper or papers of that date, I <u>do not approve his letter</u>.<sup><a href="#pri.00020_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> It seems singularly <u>malapropos</u>—&amp; in the face of my friends—their efforts there.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I believe I ought to look over your two last letters again, &amp; say something further
      about the transcripts 
      of my kind &amp; generous friends—but cannot to-day—will soon.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Send me, at your convenience, the papers that print my things—also any <u>notable</u> criticism or letter, 
      (of course don't mind the small fry.)
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know I am troubling your time &amp; activity a good deal, but I won't make any apology
      about it further 
      than to say that I am sure I deeply appreciate it.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">Good bye for this time &amp; God bless you my dearest friend.

   <p>Your parcel of books by express has been delayed—not yet gone—will go in two or three
      days—You must have rec'd the 3 copies by mail?—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="pri.00020_n1">1. Rossetti's three letters are apparently
      not extant.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="pri.00020_n2">2. The letters referred to were written on
       and . The draft of the former, which Whitman retained in his possession,
      is dated March 31, with the additional notation: "went in steamer Baltic April
      1."<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="pri.00020_n3">3. Conway was reported in the London <em>Daily News</em> as saying: "On the strength of a letter just
      received from Mr. Whitman, that the idea that he is in distress or dependent
      upon his relatives is unfounded" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9 vols., 1:345, and see 1:346). On
       Conway informed Whitman that he was
      attempting to protect the poet and his relatives from the "insults" of his
      British admirers (Traubel, 1:347). On April 17 the New York <em>Tribune</em> paraphrased Conway's remarks in the <em>Daily
         News</em>, and quoted him on April 26: "Having recently visited the poet in
      his comfortable quarters in Camden, I am compelled to deny Buchanan's gross
      exaggerations." In the margin Whitman wrote: "sent this to C[onway]—2 of 4
      [newspaper accounts]."<a href="#r3">[back]
