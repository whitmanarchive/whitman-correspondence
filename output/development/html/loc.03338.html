      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your welcome p'card of July 23<u>rd</u> reminds me how the time
      has slipped away since my last letter to you. I have now been here in North Wales
      for nearly six weeks, having retreated to these mountains very soon after returning
      from Paris. I am lodged very comfortably in the cottage of a
      quarry-man,—William Davies, who works at [illegible], 5 or 6 miles from here. He is a very good type,—healthy,
      well-built, good-natured, impulsive, with the over-carefulness of the average
      Welshman tempered by his experiences of American life, for "he went to the States,"
      as they say here, some years back, + travelled far + wide, working in mines +
      quarries. Even now he does not talk English very fluently, + prefers his native
      Welsh, in which he gives me lessons every night on his return from work. Many people
      in the district speak no English at all. The Welsh are a peculiarly adhesive race,
      +
      stick to their language + old customs, +, it must be added, to their money, with a
      somewhat dubious devotion. An infusion of American generosity + freedom would do them great good. As it
      is, <u>[illegible] +
         money-making</u> is the formula of the lives of most of them,—their
      redeeming quality being their love of music + oratory!
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I found the change here from Paris very striking. The French are exactly opposite
      in
      every way,—those who live in Paris at any rate. There the sunshine + the
      gaiety + general friendliness are very pleasantly in contrast with the grey skies
      +
      the [illegible]
      
      montonous
      
       routine of London. Paris is a sort of ideal New York,—a New York
      touched with Romance + the finer graces of the Past, but without the youthful
      ardency that pulses in Mannahatta. Paris would delight you greatly, I know, though
      you might have misgivings at last about a life so frivolously secular, so wanting
      (as it seemed to me) in humane + religious aims of the higher kind. But this
      notwithstanding, the charm of those sunny streets, + good-natured [illegible] faces, is something to
      remember.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Exhibition, I daresay, you have heard enough of. What struck me most of
      all—much more than the Eiffel Tower + other nine-days wonders, was the endless
      cosmopolitan ebb + flow of the peoples of the world,—American, Arabian,
      Japanese, Indian, Egyptian, English, Norse:—a wonderful, undescribable <u>Concourse de Monde</u>!
   </p>
   
   <p>I must stop here to-day—Post-time!—hoping to take up the story at greater
      length shortly. Luck has been dead against me of late. I suppose I shall have to
      [illegible] Quarry-man
      presently,—Scottish Art Review + other papers not paying up!
   </p>
