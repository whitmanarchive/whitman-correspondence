   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Matlock Scovel began to
      practice law in Camden in 1856. During the Civil War he was in the New Jersey
      legislature, and became a colonel in 1863. He campaigned actively for Horace
      Greeley in 1872, and was a special agent for the U.S. Treasury during Chester
      Arthur's administration. In the 1870s Whitman frequently went to Scovel's home
      for Sunday breakfast, as he did on December 2 and 9, 1877 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). For a description of
      these breakfasts, see <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed.
      William Sloane Kennedy (Boston: Small, Maynard, 1904), 59–60. For Scovel,
      see George R. Prowell's <em>The History of Camden County, New
         Jersey</em> (Philadelphia: L. J. Richards, 1886).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.05903_n1">1. Apparently this letter
      was written on Tuesday, April 7, 1885, since Scovel on that date informed
      Whitman that his note had arrived too late in the evening for the "promised sour
      mash." At this time Scovel was preparing an article about Whitman for the
      Springfield <em>Republican</em>, and the poet was insisting upon
      alterations. On  Scovel suggested that "to
      start <em>right</em> again I think you had better send me my
      MSS—and let me do as I d—n please with it." On  and again on  Scovel asked Whitman to return the manuscript. The article, simply
      called "Walt Whitman," was sent to the newspaper on May 22 (Whitman's
      Commonplace Book) and appeared on June 15; it detailed Whitman's financial
      returns from the sale of articles and books with information obviously supplied
      by the poet.<a href="#r1">[back]
