      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got your envelope with the proof sheet of the poem, which I afterwards saw in the
      magazine.<sup><a href="#n1081" id="r1">1</a></sup> Thanks.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was delighted with the poem. No poem in the English tongue excels it in beauty or
      equals it in grandeur.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Springfield <u>Republican</u> article I forwarded at once, as you
      desired, to Dr. Bucke.<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r2">2</a></sup> I wonder who wrote it. Bucke, whom that infamous <u>Nation</u> article never stirred, was roused by this, and
      wrote me a slogging comment on it! For my own part, it (the Republican article) made
      me marvel. The implied tribute to you is so high, that the rest makes me wonder. His
      interpretation (I mean the Republican writer's) seemed to me quite an instantial piece of
      pure wrong-headedness. Where you wrote "physiological", he reads "sexual", and then
      makes an ass of himself in commentary.
   </p>
   
   <p>John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r3">3</a></sup> is here. It is five years since I saw him, and his appearance gave me
      delight. He tells me you think of settling up on the Hudson, which I should fancy a good idea.
   </p>
   
   <p>John says he heard that <u>Tribune</u> article which I walloped in
      Bucke's book was written by a woman! This seems <u>impossible</u>. I <u>cannot</u> make my belief square with such a notion.<sup><a href="#n1082" id="r4">4</a></sup></p>
   
   <p><u>Au revoir</u>. I am up to my ears in office work, wretchedly
      unwell, and wish I could be away. The devil Ennui has been celebrated; there is
      another far more terrible and malign; it is the foul fiend Routine!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n1081">1. Possibly "With Husky-Haughty Lips,
      O Sea," which Whitman had mentioned to O'Connor in a letter of , and which was published in <em>Harper's Monthly</em> in March, 1884. The issue may have been
      distributed before the publication date. William Sloane Kennedy also discusses
      this poem in a  letter to
      Whitman.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">3. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1082">4. The "<u>Tribune</u> article" O'Connor refers to is a review, "New Publications,"
      <em>New-York Tribune</em> 41 (19 November 1881): 4. His attack
      on this review can be found in Bucke's <em>Walt Whitman</em> where
      he declares "it would seem to have been written . . . in a brothel. . . . The
      whole article is thoroughly obscene" (81).<a href="#r4">[back]
