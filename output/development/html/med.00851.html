   <p>Dear friend; and all your folks, all the family—<sup><a href="#med.00851_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>I
      have been very ill for over a fortnight and still badly and weak yet—not yet
      quite definite—but the Doctor<sup><a href="#med.00851_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup> favors the probability. The heat is
      great—but in pulse and appetite things help me along; also in good
      spirits. Good remembrances and affection to you all.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Hunter (1818–1894) was a Scottish immigrant to Virginia in the 1880s, 
      where he farmed before moving to the Philadelphia area to work in publishing and edit
      a New Jersey weekly newspaper. He and his daughter 
      Susan (1864–1933) visited the poet in Camden numerous times. See Susan Hunter Walker,
      "I Knew Walt Whitman," in William White, ed., 
      <em>1980: Leaves of Grass at 125</em> (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1980), 71–74.

   <p id="med.00851_n2">2. In her article "I Knew
      Walt Whitman," James Hunter's daughter Sarah Hunter Walker (1864–1933)
      recorded her contacts with the poet after her arrival in the United States from
      Scotland. According to Walker, her father and Whitman discussed "questions of
      philosophy, religion, biology and the humanities" (See her essay in <em>1980: Leaves of Grass at 125: Eight essays</em>, ed. William
      White [Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1980], 72).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="med.00851_n4">3. Whitman was being cared for by several doctors at this time. Canadian physician and
      psychiatrist 
      Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) had visited Whitman earlier in June, and in 1885
      he had introduced Whitman to Sir William Osler (1849–1919), another 
      Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns Hopkins Hospital,
      where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Osler also visited Whitman in June.
