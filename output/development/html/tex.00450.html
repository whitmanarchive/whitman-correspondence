   <p>By an announcement in the Phil: <em>Press</em> this morning I suppose
      you have used my "How I made a Book"<sup><a href="#tex.00450_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp;c for the newspaper syndicate—All right. What I am somewhat concerned ab't is
      that I have not seen the proof (which is always an important point with
      me)—&amp; my 100 slips—What I mainly write now for, is to say, if
      possible, to have the slips run off from your type if still standing, &amp; sent me
      here—Thanks for the prompt pay—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);
