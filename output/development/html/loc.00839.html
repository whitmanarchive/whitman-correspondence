      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I sent Jeff a letter three or four days ago, which I suppose he received. There is
      nothing very new with me—I see in the U. S. Senate yesterday they passed a resolution
      that it was the sense of the Senate that there ought to be an exchange of prisoners.
      I feel as if there was a fair chance of the box you sent getting to George—I wrote
      to Jeff how I was so much surer that a box from City Point, would go through, that
      I had sent a letter to Julius Mason<sup><a href="#loc.00839_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> asking him to have a box made up there, &amp; sent, giving him the address, &amp; I or Jeff
      would pay the bill—if he writes to me that he has done so, I asked him to write if
      he got mine, I will send him the money myself—
   </p>
   
   <p>Well, mother, how are you getting along—we had a cold week, but the past three days
      has been much moderated—I am satisfied in the main with my room. I have such a good
      bed—&amp; my stove does very well—it is a little bit out of the way in location—My work as clerk in the
      Indian office is quite easy—I am through by 4—I find plenty who know me—I received
      a week's pay on Monday, came very acceptable—My appetite is not very good, but I feel
      very well upon the whole—I wish you would ask Wm Fosdick<sup><a href="#loc.00839_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> in the corner house for the <em>Times</em>, &amp; also sketch of 51st I lent him, &amp; put them away—I am very glad I have employment
      (&amp; <em>pay</em>)—I must try to keep it—I send you an envelope, so that you can write me a letter
      soon as convenient. I send $1 for Nancy, the other for you—I may not write again till
      about the 12th, or perhaps 10th—
   </p>
   
   <p>Tell Hattie &amp; sis Uncle Walt sent them his love. I see Gen. Butler<sup><a href="#loc.00839_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> says the fault of not exchanging the prisoners is not his but Grants.

   <p>My room is 468 M street, 2d door west of 12th—from 10 till 4, I am in the Indian Bureau,
      north-east corner Patent Office, basement.<sup><a href="#loc.00839_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00839_n1">1. Probably Julius W. Mason,
      a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry. On , Jeff mentioned a J. W. Mason, who "used to be in my party on
      the Water Works." When George considered staying in the army after the war, Jeff
      conferred with Mason; see his letter of . Mason remained in the army until his death in 1882. According to
      his letter to Jeff on , Whitman
      wrote to "Captain" Mason the same day; on , Jeff noted that Mason had complied with Whitman's request. Whitman
      apparently wrote again on February 13, and Mason replied from City Point on  that a box had been sent to George on
      February 10, and that Whitman's letter would be forwarded by "1st Flag of
      Truce."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00839_n2">2. Not listed in the
      1865–1866 Directory.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00839_n3">3. In a speech at Lowell,
      Massachusetts, on January 29, 1865, Butler blamed Grant for the collapse of the
      prisoner exchange. In an editorial on the following day, the <em>New York Times</em> termed Butler's address "exceedingly able, defiant and
      mischievous."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00839_n4">4. When Horace Traubel read
      this letter on December 13, 1888, Whitman was unusually moved: "O God! that
      whole damned war business is about nine hundred and ninety parts diarrhoea to
      one part glory: the people who like the wars should be compelled to fight the
      wars . . . I say, God damn the wars—all wars" (<em>With Walt
         Whitman in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard &amp; Company,
      1906–96], 3:293).<a href="#r4">[back]
