      Another perfect sunny day—plenty warm enough—am feeling 
      middling fair—toast, a rare fried egg, &amp; a cup of tea, for breakfast
      (demolished all)—the vibrating voices of the loud-crying peddlers in the streets,
      
      quite a musical study, some of them have wonderfully fine organs as they 
      peal and drawl them along &amp; it is fine, healthy, strengthening, expanding,
      blood-circulating &amp; blood-clarifying exercising, calling loudly out in 
      the open air this way, throwing the voices out freely, slowly walking along
      —I almost envy them, (with their cabbages, fish or what not, &amp; their old

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07697_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden (?) |
      Sep 1 | 5 PM | [illegible]; Philadelphia | Sep | 1 | 7PM | 1889; Buffalo, N.Y. | Sep | 2 | 1 PM | 1889 | Transit;

   <p id="loc.07313_n3">2. Whitman mentions Dick Flynn
      in his  letter to Thomas
      Nicholson. Like Nicholson, Flynn was an employee at Bucke's asylum.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">3. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07697_n4">4. Whitman was thinking of
      printing a select group of photos on uniform cards and arranging them in an envelope
      or album. At this
      time he even wrote up instructions to the printer specifying a run of 200 copies
      with gilt labeling and the title <em>Pictures from life of
         WW.</em> The project, like many others in Whitman's final years, was never
      completed (though a smaller edition of six portraits in a ribbon-tied envelope
      did appear in 1889).<a href="#r4">[back]

         Magazine</em>, established in 1850, became successful by reprinting British
      novels before eventually publishing American authors. The magazine published six
      of Whitman's poems between 1874 and 1892. For more information on Whitman's
      relationship with <em>Harper's</em>, see Susan Belasco's

   <p id="n4267">9. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt

   <p id="loc.03027_n4">10. For Whitman's seventieth
      birthday, Horace Traubel and a large committee planned a local celebration for
      the poet in Morgan's Hall in Camden, New Jersey. The committee included Henry
      (Harry) L. Bonsall, Geoffrey Buckwalter, and Thomas B. Harned. See Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.30.html">Tuesday, May 7, 1889</a>. The day was celebrated with a testimonial
      dinner. Numerous authors and friends of the poet prepared and delivered
      addresses to mark the occasion. Whitman, who did not feel well at the time,
      arrived after the dinner to listen to the remarks.<a href="#r10">[back]

   <p id="loc.03027_n3">11. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r11">[back]

   <p id="n6122">13. Logan Pearsall Smith
      (1865–1946) was an essayist and literary critic. He was the son of Robert
      Pearsall Smith, a minister and writer who befriended Whitman, and he was the
      brother of Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, one of Whitman's most avid followers.
      For more information on Logan, see Christina Davey "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_106.html">Smith, Logan Pearsall (1865–1946)</a>," <em>Walt

      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt

      against slavery and to sell her book, <em>Narrative of Sojourner
         Truth: A Northern Slave</em>. She served as a delegate from Massachusetts to
      the first national Woman's Rights Convention, and would continue to travel the
