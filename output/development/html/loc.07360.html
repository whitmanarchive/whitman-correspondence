   <p>May-be you will like to read Kennedy's letter—so I send it on. There was to be
      a meeting of the N E Womans' Club, (somewhat swell) last Monday Evn'g—at wh'
      Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r2">2</a></sup> was invited to take a hand—as I &amp; mine were to be the
      themes—&amp; K requested of me to send him replicas of Morse's<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r3">3</a></sup> plaster h'd &amp; Cox's new photo,<sup><a href="#loc.07360_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>
      wh' I did—furthermore see letter<sup><a href="#loc.07360_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>A dull spell of weather here—cloudy &amp; raw—I don't get out or around
      much—going out to-morrow—Thanksgiving dinner, to my friends Mrs and Mr
      Lawyer Harned<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup>—turkey &amp; champagne—always
      have something good to drink, &amp; plenty of it—(H. has the best whiskey in
      America)—&amp; a blazing wood fire—also a charming little girl &amp;
      boy—I go there quite often—
   </p>
   
   <p>In the London budget in N Y Tribune Nov. 22, is a short letter (extract) from
      Tennyson<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r7">7</a></sup> to me<sup><a href="#loc.07360_n3" id="r8">8</a></sup>—rather
      curious—nothing important—I sent T. one of Cox's photos of me (the
      "laughing philosopher")—&amp; this I suppose is an answer or part
      thereof—but how it got out &amp; in cable is funny—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dear O'C, I havn't heard from you in a month. Write soon, do. Dear Maurice, yours
      of
      20th came this morning. Ernest Rhys<sup><a href="#loc.03310_n1" id="r9">9</a></sup> has not arrived here
      yet, but I am looking for him. Morse is here to-day. Mr Eakins of Phila: has
      commenced painting me. A bouncing Thanksgiving week to you both—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>This letter is addressed to two
      close acquaintances of Whitman: William Douglas O'Connor (1832–1889) and
      the Canadian physician Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902). For more on
      these figures, see these entries from <em>Walt Whitman: An

   <p id="loc.07360_n1">1. Miller's transcription
      contains the following: ENDORSED (by O'Connor): "Answ'd Nov. 25/87 | Sent Dr.
      Bucke. It is addressed: Wm D. O'Connor | Life Saving Service | Washington | D C.

   <p id="n3039">2. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0862">3. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,

   <p id="loc.07360_n4">4. George C. Cox
      (1851–1903) was a well-known celebrity photographer who had taken multiple
      photographs of Whitman in April, 1887. The picture, entitled "The Laughing
      Philosopher," is reproduced in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1971),
      plate 174.<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="loc.07360_n2">5. Whitman's letter was
      written on the verso of one from William Sloane Kennedy, who described a meeting
      of the New England Woman's Club at which "I swept the audience away by my
      electric fire" (November 18–22, Charles E. Feinberg Collection, the
      Library of Congress). On November 25 O'Connor forwarded Whitman's letter to
      Richard Maurice Bucke. (Feinberg).<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">6. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n0625">7. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r7">[back]

      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
