       it would be well for you to give me a line to Prof. Dowden,<sup><a href="#n0199" id="r2">2</a></sup> telling him
      that you have read the bibliography of my forthcoming book, and that you think you
      can commend the work to his careful reading. Also a word of introduction to Symonds,<sup><a href="#n0615" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      in case he will be willing to write an Introduction to it, (the book). I am afraid
      they will be but dilatory in taking hold of the matter on my request alone,. But a
      word of introduction from you, worded as you please, would secure their devoted
      service. There is not a word of criticism in the book; it is solely an enthusiastic
      eulogy and an 
      interpetation
      
       and 
      defence   
      
       of your whole life, aims, and work,—accompanied by a
      valuable 
      bibliog.
      
       and concordance, with an appendix, and three illustrations. My belief is
      that it will have a great sale in Great Britain, if it is got before your public
      there in the right way. For my part, I dislike to ask anyone for to serve as
      go-between, but you seemed to think it would be wise. Be sure and tell me always how
      you are. I am just finishing the chapter "Walt W. &amp; his Friends". My roses are
      superb; have pitched a tent in my yard.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02896_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | Camden | New Jersey. It is postmarked: BELMONT | JUN | 18 | 1886
      | MASS; CAMDEN | JUN | 19 | 7AM | 1886 | REC'D. There is one additional, partial

   <p id="n0199">2. Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>). For more, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_93.html">Dowden, Edward (1843–1913)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n0615">3. John Addington Symonds (1840–1893), a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was author
      of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>, as well
      as <em>Walt Whitman—A Study</em> (1893), and a translator of
      Michelangelo's sonnets. But in the smaller circles of the emerging upper-class
      English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of homoerotic
      poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual inversion as it
      was then known. See Andrew Higgins, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_56.html">Symonds, John Addington [1840–1893]</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
