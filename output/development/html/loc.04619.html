      Whitman,
      <br></br>Camden 
      N.J.
      
      
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope the name subscribed hereto is not altogether forgotten by you; although when
      you were here we met but rarely, and since your change of residence we have not met
      at all.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I remember as though it were yesterday the first time I met you and the audacity with
      which I stopped you on Pennsylvania Avenue and introduced myself to you. I realize now more
      than I did then that it was audacity. But in my little intellectual life "Leaves of
      Grass" had been so much to me that I could not meet and pass you without saying
      something to you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It has long been a thought of mine that there ought to be a volume of selections from
      your works put before the public. I have often thought that many who know nothing
      of
      your writings and who have perhaps have been kept by popular criticism from reading
      your complete works, would, if they once caught a glimpse of the beauty and strength
      found there, read more extensively to their own pleasure and
      advancement and your profit.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Three or four years ago I spent an evening with
      two gentlemen friends of mine, and the conversation turning upon your works, a copy
      of
      which was upon the table beside me, I spoke somewhat at length in your favor reading
      extracts hastily selected from the volume at hand. The circumstance passed from my
      mind but a few days since one of the gentlemen referred to the occurrence saying he
      should never forget that evening as it was the beginning of his acquaintance with
      your writings from which he has since derived great pleasure This incident has suggested that
      perhaps I could prepare a volume of selections from your poems which would supply
      what I have felt to be a need and which would be acceptable to the public. I,
      therefore, have written this note to ask your permission to put such a volume of
      selections before the public in some graceful form to come out in time for the holy
      days.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A gentleman of literary tastes Mr. C. C. Adams, now of New York but formerly connected
      with
      the Treasury Department here will join me in this work. We propose that the entire
      proceeds from the sale of the book shall be yours as long as you live, stipulating
      only that in case of your death (which we pray may long be deferred) the profits
      thereafter arising shall come to us.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If you sanction our project it will be a work of love and gratitude and we shall
      labor to make you friends who shall so love you that they shall want to know more
      of
      you and to read you further.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>We do not propose an extensive work, nothing like an emasculated or expurgated
      edition of your poems, but we intend to cull detached thoughts and pictures for
      others, and our object will be to do the work before us in such a manner as only to
      enhance a fuller reading.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope our proposition will meet with your approval. We know that there are many more
      competent to discharge the work we would like to accomplish but there are none who
      would labor more reverently and lovingly to win you friends and lovers than we.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wishing you health, comfort and friends in your remaining years.</p>
