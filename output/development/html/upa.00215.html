   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ainsworth Rand Spofford
      (1825–1908) was Librarian of Congress from 1864 to 1897. In 1870, Spofford
      oversaw the transferral of American copyright records to the Library of
      Congress, also stipulating that two copies of every publication registered for
      copyright would be housed at the Library of Congress. Whitman suspected that
      Spofford did not care for the poet or his work; he told Horace Traubel that the
      librarian "has no use for me" and "suspects my work, sees no excuse for it"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.38.html">Saturday, May 5, 1888</a>).
