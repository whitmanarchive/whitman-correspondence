      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I promised to write to you a week ago Sunday Evening and did not do it—I have no apology
      to offer—Years ago Dear Walt—(And looking back over the tombstones it [
      <span class="unclear">seems?</span>]
       Centuries)—Father used to tell me I was lazy Mother denied it—and in latter years—(but
      O' my friend still looking over tombstones) I used to tell your Mother you was lazy
      and she denied it.—You have assented yourself. I have confirmed my Father—O, Walt
      what recollections will crowd upon us both, individually and in company from the above.
      To me the home so long long past—the brother—sisters—the sea—the return—New York, the Stage box,—Broadway,—Walt,—the Press—the Railroad Marriage, Express—Babies—trouble.
      <u>Rum</u> More trouble—More <u>Rum</u>—Estrangement from you. <u>More Rum</u>.—Good intentions, sobriety Misunderstanding and more <u>Rum</u></p>
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>Up and down&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      down and up,‑The innate manly nature of <u>myself</u> at times getting the best of it and at other times Entirely submerged—Now praying
      now cursing—Yet Ever hoping—and Even now my friend often loosing my hold of the highest
      rung of the ladder of fortune I Ever reached and dropping slowly but surely from rung
      to rung until I have almost reached the bottom I still hope—From causes 
      to
      
       numerous and complex to Explain <u>Except verbally</u> I found myself in June last in Brooklyn possessed of a wife and four boys—aged 12-9-4
      .
      
       years—and one of 8 months—no money no credit—no friends of a/c and no furniture—Well,
      I am writing with my own pen, ink, and paper on my own table, in a hired room, warmed
      by my own fire and lighted by my own oil—my wife sleeping on a bed near me and the
      Boys in an adjoining room.—
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I have just got through supper after a hard days work and have to start again in the
      morning at 7 o'clock and am glad of it—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      I am living on Atlantic ave one door above Classon ave and have been down past our <u>old</u> home several times this summer taking Freddie with me—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is never a day passes but what I think of you</p>
   
   <p>So much have you left to be remembered by—a Broadway stage—a Fulton ferry boat, a
      bale of cotton on the dock. The "Brooklyn Daily Times"—a ship loading or unloading at the wharf.—a poor man fallen from the roof of a new
      building a woman &amp; child suffocated by smoke in a burning tenement house, all—all
      to me speak of thee Dear Walt.—
   </p>
   
   <p>Seeing then my friend the past thou occupiest in my spiritual nature—. I feel assured
      you will forgive any remissness
      
      
      of me in writing—My love my Walt is with you alway.—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I earnestly pray God that he may see fit to assauge your suffering and in due time restore your wonted health and strength owing to "<u>impecuniosity</u>" (The first time I Ever seen that word was in a letter from R.W. Emerson to you while
      we were living in Classon ave. Excusing himself as I now do) I cannot promise to come and see you soon—&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      But Walt should you become seriously ill, promise to telegraph to me immediately.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My Father is Dead. Brother Burke is dead</p>
   <p>I have not heard from Mother in 10 months.—</p>
   
   
   <p>My wife is faithful-loving-honest, true, and one you Could dearly love.</p>
