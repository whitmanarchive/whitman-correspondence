      <br></br><br></br>Friend Walter,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your letters &amp;c have all been received and delivered to Han.,<sup><a href="#n0285" id="r1">1</a></sup> Respecting her neglect of writing her aged mother,<sup><a href="#n0705" id="r2">2</a></sup> not the
      slightest apology can be offerd. I have been compelled for a long time to procure
      [
      <span class="unclear">a?</span>]
       novel, for her
      "Sunday" reading—and certainly, if she spends Sunday this way, she can't write
      to her mother. It is reasonable to anticipate, from Mrs. Whitmans past robustness,
      [
      <span class="unclear">and?</span>]
       present
      approaching infirmities, that she will never undergo protracted sickness, but her
      demise, when it does take place, will occur in a brief period. It may so happen that
      Hannah may not be permitted to see her mother again (although I trust that Mrs
      Whitman will live many 
      years to come.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have reasoned with Han in this way, but without avail—Han 
      realy
      
       experiences no outward sentiment or sympathy—This neglect [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       hers is odious to me. I
      have told her frankly that it is impossible for me to respect her, in view [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       this; coupled with her
      indifference, [
      <span class="unclear">and?</span>]
      
      ingratitude in other cases.
   </p>
   
   <p>She drudges about the same—[
      <span class="unclear">"washing"?</span>]
       now takes place three days of the week, commencing Sunday
      morning; and her appearance would disgrace any servant in the vicinity. It seems
      impossible for me to maintain any respectable degree of order—It has become
      more than constant controversy—
      allmost
      
       a fight. She has no respect for me, nor the least consideration for the
      [illegible]
      bear I have performed, in endeavoring [
      <span class="unclear">to?</span>]
       accomplish an agreeable neat, and pretty home—I
      can go no further with it—We occupy but three rooms [
      <span class="unclear">of?</span>]
       the house, and these are
      badly kept.  ; my
      personal washing amounts to just 4 pieces a week, with a pair of stocking and two
      or
      three handkerchiefs.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have three vacant rooms—I dare not let them, at a handsome rent, or either
      use them myself professionally—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A greater want of morals or womanly sensibility could scarcely be found and
      intellectual imbecility—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She has been some days, and succeeds in tracing 3 lines to her mother, in "lead"
      pencil—I grow indignant and exasperated—No man assumes so much household
      responsibilities as I do, and all but for two persons—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Han speaks of visiting Brooklyn. I make no objection, although it will bring no
      comfort to her mother, I [
      <span class="unclear">predict.?</span>]
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She is too thoroughly selfish—There has been a proposition also for my
      absence—a few short months, [illegible] run down my place more than [
      <span class="unclear">I?</span>]
       would like to
      recover—So I shall rent the house—It is but a shelter since, I was sick;
      she deliberately turned the key on me, and I had to stay at my room all
      night—comment is unnecessary—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0285">1. Hannah Louisa (Whitman) Heyde (1823–1908),
      youngest sister of Walt Whitman, married Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890),

   <p id="n0705">2. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
