   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n3021">1. Captain Respegius Edward Lindell
      worked for the Camden ferries (<em>Specimen Days</em>, ed. Floyd
      Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963], 183). He was also a viola
      player (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">2. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0335">3. Among early friends at Camden was John R. Johnston
      (1826–1895), "the jolliest man I ever met, an artist, a great talker,"
      Whitman wrote in a , letter to
      Peter Doyle. Johnston was a portrait and landscape painter who for years
      maintained a studio in Philadelphia and lived at 434 Penn Street in Camden. See
      <em>The New-York Historical Society Dictionary of Artists in
         America, 1564–1860</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1957).
      Whitman was fond of Johnston's children, Ida and Jack (John Jr.).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00237_n5">4. John W. Forney
      (1817–1881) established the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in
      1857, the Washington <em>Sunday Morning Chronicle</em> in 1861,
      and the <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> in 1862. In 1878 he
      founded the Philadelphia <em>Progress</em>, a weekly magazine to
      which Whitman contributed; "The First Spring Day on Chestnut Street" appeared in
      the <em>Progress</em> on March 8, 1879 (<em>Specimen
         Days</em>, ed. Floyd Stovall [New York: New York University Press, 1963],
      188–190). During the Washington years Whitman's self-puffs had frequently
      appeared in Forney's newspapers. Later in 1879 the publisher accompanied Whitman
      to Kansas (see the letter from Walt to Louisa Whitman of ).<a href="#r4">[back]
