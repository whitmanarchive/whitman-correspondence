   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00602_n2">1. This letter dates to
      between December 20 and December 22, 1870. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the
      letter November 30, 1870 on an accompanying slip of paper held in the Trent
      Collection (not reproduced here). Bucke's month and date are unlikely to be
      correct because Louisa acknowledges receiving a letter from Walt "this
      wensday morning the last day of autumn." Bucke's year, 1870, however, is
      corroborated by other matters in the letter: a visit to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman by Ellen M. O'Connor and her daughter Jean; the presence of Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's family in St. Louis; Louisa's receipt of copies
      of the Boston <em>Radical</em>, presumably copies with a
      printing of Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman" from May
      of that year; and the absence of son George Washington Whitman from Brooklyn
      with the expectation that he will visit the coming weekend.<br><br>
      In the letter, Louisa writes that "Ellen M. O'Connor "was here yesterday
      tuesday 2[1?]." Edwin Haviland Miller's date for the letter of December 22,
      1870 presumably follows from this information (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:368). But if the year is 1870, Louisa's phrase to
      describe the day on which she wrote as "wensday last day of autumn" does not
      correspond with the fact that the last day of autumn fell on Tuesday,
      December 20 (Wednesday, December 21, 1870 being the first day or winter). As
      no date in December 1870 can be consistent both with Wednesday and with the
      "last day of autumn," it is likely that either her reference to the day of
      the week or to the last day of autumn is incorrect. The presumed date for
      the letter is the Wednesday morning that fell closest to the winter
      solstice, December 21, 1870. Another detail that supports the week before
      Christmas as the probable date is Louisa's expectation that George, who did
      not visit on Thanksgiving, is expected in Brooklyn on Saturday, Christmas
      Eve. The reference to the last day of autumn and the expectation that George
      will visit on Christmas support the week before Christmas in 1870 as the
      date of this letter. The most probable day of writing is Wednesday, December
      21, with the assumption that Louisa is mistaken on the intersection of
      season designation and the solstice. But given the inconsistency between
      calendar date and solstice, the letter can only be assigned a range from
      December 20 to December 22, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00602_n14">2. Neither Walt's December
      18–21?, 1870 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman nor "the books you spoke
      of" are known. Edwin Haviland Miller dated Whitman's missing letter December
      20?, 1870 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin
      Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:362).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00602_n7">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      regularly consulted almanacs, so she may be invoking the date in a strict sense.
      The winter solstice, traditionally the first day of winter, fell in the early
      morning on December 21, 1870, a Wednesday. Tuesday, December 20, 1870 was the
      last day of autumn, and Wednesday was the first day of winter. She may,
      technically, be writing early Wednesday morning before the exact hour and minute
      of the solstice and so be writing on a Wednesday but still during autumn because
      preceding the winter solstice, but that seems unlikely as she tended to rise
      early. The winter solstice fell December 21, 1870 at 1:42 am (<em>Political Manual and Annual Register for the State of New Hampshire</em>
      [Concord: McFarland and Jenks, 1869], [2]).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00602_n1">6. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor
      (1830–1910) was the wife of William D. O'Connor. Nelly O'Connor, whose
      marital strife with William had led to a separation in 1870 and resulted in
      divorce, wrote an admiring letter to Walt Whitman from Providence, Rhode Island,
      shortly before this visit to Brooklyn (see Nelly's  letter to Walt; and see Florence B. Freedman, <em>William Douglas O'Connor: Walt Whitman's Chosen Knight</em>
      [Athens: Ohio University Press, 1985], 246). For a time Walt Whitman lived with
      the O'Connors, who, with Charles Eldridge and later John Burroughs, were to be
      his close associates during the early Washington years. The correspondence
      between Walt Whitman and Nelly is almost as voluminous as the poet's
      correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00602_n20">7. The number is most likely a
      "1," but the character also resembles "7" or "9." Of these choices, only
      December 27, 1870 fell on a Tuesday. However, the "last day of autumn" (see note
      above) in the year 1870 was Tuesday, December 20. If the letter refers to the
      change of seasons at the winter solstice, "1" is the most probable
      number.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00602_n15">8. Walt Whitman dined
      frequently with William D. and Ellen M. O'Connor during his Washington years,
      and he spoke often in his letters of their daughter Jean, also known as "Jenny"
      or "Jeannie." The woman accompanying Ellen and daughter Jean may be her sister
      Mary Jane "Jeannie" Tarr Channing (1828–1897). Walt Whitman visited with
      Mary Jane and her husband Dr. William Ellery Channing during his October 1868
      visit to Providence, Rhode Island (see Walt's  letter to Peter Doyle).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">9. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00602_n13">10. The Boston <em>Radical</em> was a Unitarian periodical edited by Sidney H.
      Morse (1833–1903). The copies that Walt Whitman sent are most likely from
      an earlier issue that year, which included Anne Gilchrist's "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–359.
      For Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's opinion of Gilchrist's article, see her  letter to Walt. For more

   <p id="duk.00602_n9">12. Jean O'Connor
