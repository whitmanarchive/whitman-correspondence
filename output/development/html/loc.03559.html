   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed I clipped from the Inter Ocean today, and as this is my 48th birthday,
      I am prompted by old recolections to write you a few lines congratulating you on your 70th birthday. I hope you will
      long
      and prosper. This brings me back to 27 years ago when I used to see your sturdy form
      and kindly face in Washington. I don't know that you will remember me but I think
      you will. Do you remember the young man of the 5th 
      US Cavalary who you used to visit in Armory Square Hospital and the many times you used to take
      me into a Restaurant and give me a
      
      good square meal. I suppose you done that to so many you would hardly remember me
      by that. for all Soldiers know to you looked upon you as their friend, for you ever wore your heart on your sleeve
      to Old Soldier boys. 
      You used to call me [
      <span class="unclear">lea?</span>]
      dy thin. I well rember the last time I saw you it was in in the street in New York you had a little
      girl with you at the time, and readily recognised me. Well I have not changed so very
      much only of course somewhat older. hair sprinkled somewhat with gray. Your hair cannot
      be much more white than it was
      in the long ago. I hope you are in good healthy and may continue so to a good
       round old age. for you deserve it well an dyou also deserve well of your
      country. for you were ever a friend of the Soldier and of your country. 27 years and
      what history for the U.S has been written in that time. For the years gone by I have
      often passed through Camden,
      and had I known it was your home I should surely have stopped to see you, that I might
      once more have crasped you by the hand and looked into that kindly face and fought over our battles (once
      again) in Washington. 
      I would like very much to hear from you. should you remember once and have the leisure
      and should I in the future be near Camden. I will certainly
      do myself the pleasure of calling on you.
   </p>
