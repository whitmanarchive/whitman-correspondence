   <p>I have been and am still in considerable of a flustration here—have had the
      Inspector, he left yesterday, have to go to Toronto this afternoon to interview the
      minister of Public Works about the new building to replace one burned. Shall be back
      here again Monday evening or Tuesday. We are all well, sleighing's done though
      still a great deal of ice and snow over the fields &amp;c I enclose Lippencott's
      letter<sup><a href="#loc.07210_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—have heard nothing since about the
      Worthington business.<sup><a href="#prc.00056_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> Have done nothing more with my  W.W. paper, shall
      rewrite it as soon as I get a little time (a mighty hard thing to find nowadays) and
      I think send it to Walsh<sup><a href="#loc.04628_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> of Lippencott. Or would it be
      well to keep it until Kennedy's<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r5">5</a></sup> book comes out (will be out
      very soon now I suppose?) and incorperate it in a notice of that book—?
   </p> 
   
   <p>In any case I shall get to work elaborating it as soon as I can—It has been snowing,
      &amp; blowing great guns all day—there is a lull now and sun trying to come
      out.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07210_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle Street | Camden | New Jersey | USA. It is postmarked:

   <p id="loc.07210_n2">2. Bucke had tried to
      place <em>Leaves of Grass</em> with the publishing house
      Lippencott's, which rejected it on March 6th.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.04628_n1">4. William S. Walsh

   <p id="n3039">5. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
