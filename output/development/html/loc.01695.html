      The Committee of the American Institute had written on , "to solicit of you the honor of
      a poem on the occasion of its opening, September 7, 1871—with the
      privilege of furnishing proofs of the same to the Metropolitan Press for
      publication with the other proceedings.…We shall be most happy, of
      course, to pay traveling expenses &amp; entertain you hospitably, and pay
      $100 in addition."<br><br>
      The newspaper coverage of Walt Whitman's appearance was extensive: the
      Washington <em>Daily Morning Chronicle</em> published the
      poet's account on September 7, 1871; the New York <em>Evening
         Post</em> reprinted the poem, later entitled <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00005.html">"After All, Not to Create Only,"</a> and called Walt Whitman "a good
      elocutionist"; he was also praised in the New York <em>Sun</em> and the Brooklyn <em>Standard</em>; the New York
      <em>Tribune</em> printed excerpts from the poem on
      September 8, 1871, and later a devastating parody by Bayard Taylor
      (reprinted in his <em>Echo Club</em> [2nd ed., 1876],
      169–170); the Springfield <em>Republican</em> published
      the poem on September 9, 1871. In reply to the criticisms of the poem, Walt
      Whitman prepared the following for submission to an unidentified newspaper:
      "The N. Y. <em>World's</em> frantic, feeble, fuddled articles
      on it are curiosities. The <em>Telegram</em> dryly calls it
      the longest conundrum ever yet given to the public" (Yale). See also Horace
      Traubel, <em><a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.78.html">With Walt Whitman in Camden</a></em> (1906–1996),
      1:328–329; Emory Holloway, <em>Whitman–An
         Interpretation in Narrative</em> (1926), <em>American
         Mercury</em>, 18 (1929), 485–486; and Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
      433–435.<br><br>
      On , John W. Chambers,
      secretary of the Institute, thanked Walt Whitman "for the magnificent
      original poem."<a href="#r1">[back]
