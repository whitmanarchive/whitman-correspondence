   <p>At the breakfast table this morning we all agreed—my sister most
      markedly—that your piece in the March <em>Century</em> is the
      best you have written<sup><a href="#yal.00430_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I think so, after two
      readings. Don't you go back however on any positions (naturalistic &amp; critical)
      you have taken in former essays &amp; books—<em>they are all
         just right &amp; needed</em>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Dr Bucke's book is in the printer's hands—I am well as usual—Best love
      &amp; remembrances to you &amp; all—
   </p>
