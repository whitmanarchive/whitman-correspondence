   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00607_n5">1. This letter dates to June
      13, 1871. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter June 13, 1871, and this date is
      almost certain. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt Whitman,
      <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University
      Press, 1961–77], 2:368). At the close of the letter, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman asks Walt to "write in your this weeks letter what day you will come."
      Walt arrived in Brooklyn for his vacation on Wednesday the following week (see
      his  letter to Peter Doyle).
      If Louisa wrote on Tuesday afternoon and Walt received this letter before he
      left Washington, it had to be sent on Tuesday, June 13 (rather than June 20). As
      Walt generally notified Louisa of his planned visits well beforehand—and
      he notified Abby Price of his intent to take an early summer vacation this year
      in his  letter—the June 13,
      1871 date is the only one that accords with Louisa's being aware of when Walt
      would take his summer 1871 vacation.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00556_n3">2. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00607_n6">3. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      claimed that the work she performed on the renovation or upkeep of "georgeys
      house," probably the house at 71 Portland Avenue but possibly another property
      in his speculative housebuilding business, entitled her to withhold the rent
      that she had paid the two previous months.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00607_n7">4. The source of income for
      George Washington Whitman was work completed for Joseph Phineas Davis
      (1837–1917), chief engineer of the Water Works in Lowell, Massachusetts,
      between 1870 and 1871. Davis, a close friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman
      and the Whitman family, employed George to inspect pipe. For Davis's work with
      Jeff Whitman in St. Louis, see the following letters from Jeff to Walt Whitman:
      , , and . Louisa was
      also friendly with Davis, who stopped by her house in Brooklyn after he departed
      St. Louis when working in Lowell (see her  letter to Walt). For Davis's career, see Francis P. Stearns and
      Edward W. Howe, "Joseph Phineas Davis," <em>Journal of the Boston
         Society of Civil Engineers</em> 4 (December 1917), 437–442.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00607_n8">5. Louisa's letters "r" and "n"
      at the end of words are sometimes nearly indistinguishable: this is one of those
      cases. The letter looks more like her typical "r," which might place emphasis on
      fixing up the house (removing carpet, putting up paper, cleaning) so that George
      Washington Whitman could sell it and "clear" a profit. Or she may have
      considered carpet removal and scrubbing as making the section of the house more
      presentable for tenants, as cleaning it. Whether new tenants were sought for a
      section of the Portland Avenue house or she was working on another property in
      George's housebuilding business is not known.<a href="#r5">[back]
