      <br></br><br></br>Dear Nelly,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your late letter reached me, enclosing the piece from the <em>Academy</em>.<sup><a href="#nyp.00355_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have been worse than usual for a week—very pronounced swimming spells &amp; dizziness
      in the head, 
      with sometimes deathly faintness &amp; great prostration—(twice I thought serious)—am
      sitting up to-day &amp; yesterday—havn't been out—now this is the ninth day—continuous qualmishness &amp; headache—doctor thinks
      however it is all substantially 
      a stomach &amp; liver business—he comes every day—does not seem to be alarmed—I am taking
      mild powders of mercury for the liver—&amp; drops composed of bromides 
      of potash &amp; ammonia—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is death all around me here—Two yesterday of persons I know—I send you a piece
      by me 
      from the paper here<sup><a href="#nyp.00355_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—the young man alluded to was much like one of my most cherished soldier cases 
      in the Hospitals ten years since. He lived on the next block, &amp; I was with him 
      a great deal—&amp; at death.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Nelly, I just send you, (although one or two items confidential, sort o') Mrs. Price's
      last letter to me, 
      two days since—read it, &amp; destroy it—I also send Mrs. Davis's, she (Mrs. P) sent me, 
      as you are interested in her—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall get better, &amp; shall come on to Washington yet—on a brief visit—Tell Charles
      Eldridge 
      I shall write to him this week—My brother &amp; sister &amp; Eddy here are well—My sister
      at Burlington, 
      Vt. was as usual at last acc'ts—also Jeff &amp; his girls at St. Louis—As I write I am sitting here 
      in my big chair alone (<em>alone muchly</em>,) in the parlor by the window—It is a rainy darkish day here—the wind south &amp; mild—
   </p>

   <p>If Pete Doyle comes up to see you, read him this letter—also give him the printed
      slip to read—
