   </p>
   
   <p>What on earth can I say to you in response to the news about your dearest mother in
      my<sup><a href="#upa.00080_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> letter rec'd this morning?—words are such
      weak things any how in so deep &amp; solemn a case—makes me heavy hearted
      indeed, &amp; have been so, all the day. As it is I can only send best best love
      &amp; thoughts dwelling with her all the time<sup><a href="#upa.00080_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—I
      have seriously considered coming to London—but it seems impossible—I am
      still here—my eyesight is less disturbed, is nearly ab't as formerly—but
      my walking power worse than ever—they have to half carry me out to the wagon
      to take the only little exercise I get every day—but my spirits remain cheery
      &amp; buoyant as ever—I eat and sleep fairly—am so far without any pain
      of violence—&amp; still have my good &amp; kind housekeeper Mrs.
      Davis—Have just rec'd the third instalment (31 pounds 19 shillings) of the good English
      "offering" from Wm Rossetti—(some 49 pounds previously,—making 81 pounds
      or thereabout altogether so far rec'd)<sup><a href="#upa.00080_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—and I can
      assure you it has been  all most acceptable to me—&amp; heart's thanks to you
      all—I was down yesterday to the Staffords' at Glendale.<sup><a href="#upa.00080_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—O how I wish I could see your dearest mother—again my best, deepest love to
      her.

   <p id="upa.00080_n3">3. On  Gilchrist reported to Whitman that
      "Mother is very sickly." On  he said:
      "Her condition is critical. Four years ago our dear mother was attacked by
      cancer with left breast. . . . Her strength seems daily ebbing and her heart is
      very weak." Mrs. Gilchrist died the day before Whitman sent this letter. The son
      wrote with deep emotion on : "The lovely
      spirit fled on Sunday afternoon at five o'clock. . . . Ten days ago mother asked
      me if I had written to you. . . . on her tomb I shall find a line from Leaves of
      Grass. In a little memoranda addressed to us she noted your name down as the one
      friend in America to whom we were to write to, in announcing darling mother's
      death. She died in my arms."<a href="#r3">[back]
