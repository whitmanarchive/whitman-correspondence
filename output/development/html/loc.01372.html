      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am writing this note to introduce to thee our friend Mr. William Summers,<sup><a href="#n4299" id="r2">2</a></sup> who is a Member of Parliament. He will be able to give thee
      
      an interesting inside view of English political life, for he is Junior Whip to the
      Liberal Party.
   </p>         
   
   <p>I am glad to take this chance to send warm rememberances from all of us &amp; our
      
      hopes that thy health is standing the summer weather.
   </p>
   
   <p>Believe me,</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      (1853–1893) was a member of the British Parliament, junior whip of the
      Liberal Party, and strong proponent of Irish home rule. He visited Whitman on
      September 26, 1888. His account of the visit was published in <em>The Pall Mall Gazette</em> on <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/interviews/transcriptions/med.00539.html">October 18, 1888 </a>. Whitman said of the visit that "Summers hit me
      hard. He made a grand show-up—had fine ways—was young, strong,
      optimistic" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>,
      <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.74.html">Wednesday, September 26, 1888</a>).<a href="#r2">[back]
