   <p>Your card of 9th to hand yesterday. Long letter from Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup>.
      Seems to be same excitement down your way about some man named Walt Whitman and
      another man named Ingersoll<sup><a href="#n0839" id="r3">3</a></sup>. What is it all about anyhow?<sup><a href="#loc.07118_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup> Sorry to hear that grip and bladder troubles still stick
      to you—they seem to have come to stay—worse luck. It is good news
      however that you have sent off the
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"Old Poets" piece to N.A. Review<sup><a href="#loc.07118_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—I look forwards
      with most pleasant anticipations to seeing it—I think if any thing your prose
      gets better lately—though the best piece you (or almost one one) ever wrote
      was the '55 preface.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes "Liberty and Literature" is good—no title could be better, and won't
      Ingersoll make a splendid address on such a subject? I guess it will be the biggest
      thing yet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I hope to see you a week tomorrow at the latest—i.e. Monday 20th—I think
      if I was sick a bed and no money I would find a way to attend this circus. Keep
      writing meanwhile 
      untill
      
       say Thursday evening (and tell Horace same) I want to be kept posted.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My annual Report is most done hope to finish it tomorrow—All well here!</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="n0839">3. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r3">[back]
