      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do you know much about the half-profit system of publication? My publishers still
      stick to me for a book &amp; say that if I am not content with the usual 10 per
      cent, they will publish on 1/2 profit basis. I don't know which is best, since the
      figuring is with them.
   </p>
   
   <p>At the time I wrote
      you last I was summoned home to 
      fathers
      
      
      death bed. He died Jany 9th from apoplexy, aged 81, lived about 36 hours after the
      stroke. He had said to me in the summer that he hoped to go in that way I know it
      is
      best it should be so, but I find it impossible to reason myself out of a sense of
      deepest loss. How desolate now does the old home look to me in the [
      <span class="unclear">mids?</span>]
       of the bleak winter 
      land scape!
   </p>
   
   <p>We are counting on going to Washington about middle of Feb. &amp; [
      <span class="unclear">hope?</span>]
       to see you there or on our way.
      What do you say.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am reading 
      Carlyles "Frederick"<sup><a href="#n1065" id="r1">1</a></sup>—the most wonderful history I ever opened. It seems to me
      to eclipse other histories as the electric light eclipses a tallow dip. I get so
      excited over the battles I can hardly hold the book.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am looking much in 
      Arnolds<sup><a href="#n1067" id="r2">2</a></sup> works too—a wonderfully clear, direct, sensitive,
      flexible mind—a writer who really has steady limpid <u>currents</u> of ideas—If he only had more heartiness &amp; could get
      free of these slight collegiate contemptuousness &amp; aloofness. I am going to
      wrestle with him one of these days &amp; see just what I make of him. Thanks for the
      papers you send. Your Indian sketch is again superb.<sup><a href="#n1080" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Cold here, with the river whooping at night like a colossal Indian, or is it more
      like the explosions
      of flatulency?
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
