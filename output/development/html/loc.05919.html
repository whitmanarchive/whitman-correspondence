      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt<sup xmlns=""><a href="#n2002" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I did not much think you 
      wd
      
       care to go in for the Consul business. Well that
      being disposed of I want you to turn your attention seriously to coming here for the
      Summer. My plan is that sometime (any time) before the 1st June John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r2">2</a></sup> should run down to Philadelphia and take you to Esopus then
      about 1st June I would go to Esopus and come on here. We all want you and will
      undertake to make you comfortable for the summer and for the winter too if you will
      stay. It is likely you will hear from Burroughs before very long and when you do let
      me know how the project strikes you<sup><a href="#loc.05919_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>Mrs Bucke wishes me to send her love to you</p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      I am affectionately yours
      <br></br>R M Bucke
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still taking "The Critic"<sup><a href="#loc.05919_n32" id="r4">4</a></sup> so saw the article
      and like it much. You did not mention before the change in your housekeeping
      arrangements but Mr Smith<sup><a href="#loc.05919_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup> said something to me in a
      letter about it. I am glad to hear that you are more comfortable but hope that
      that fact will not decide you to stay home all summer instead of coming here as
      you ought to do—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have had no more of the Round Table series<sup><a href="#loc.05919_n1" id="r6">6</a></sup> since I
      sent the last to you—it is time some more were coming

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n2002">1. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.05919_n4">5. Whitman made the
      following entry in his Commonplace Book for 24 February 1885: "Mary Davis moves
      into 328 Mickle" (267). Robert Pearsall Smith had apparently informed Bucke that
      Mrs. Mary Oakes Davis, with whom Whitman had been taking his meals, had moved in
      as his housekeeper. Her relations with Whitman and Bucke are thoroughly
      discussed in Elizabeth Leavitt Keller's <em>Walt Whitman in Mickle
         Street</em> (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1921).<a href="#r5">[back]
