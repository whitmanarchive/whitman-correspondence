   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00592_n1">1. Richard Maurice Bucke dated
      this letter April 13, 1870, and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman received a
      letter from Walt Whitman "today the 13t" (not extant), and she had received a
      letter from her daughter Mary Van Nostrand, to whom she had written about the
      death of Jesse Whitman. The letter also refers to Thomas Jefferson Whitman's
      departure from St. Louis as "last thursday a week ago tomorrow," which would
      mean that Louisa wrote on a Wednesday. Louisa had anticipated a possible visit
      by Jeff in her  letter to Walt.
      Because a letter from Mary Van Nostrand after her brother Jesse's death would be
      expected, because Jeff's visit is consistent with her earlier letter, and
      because April 13 fell on Wednesday, this letter dates to April 13, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00592_n9">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. Louisa
      Van Velsor Whitman had written the previous week of a possible visit by her son
      Jeff during his trip to Pittsburgh (see her  letter to Walt). As a civil engineer, Jeff in 1867 became
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally recognized name. For

      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,

      Jesse Whitman (1818–1870), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's eldest son, died
      at Kings County Lunatic Asylum on March 21, 1870. Jesse had suffered from
      mental illness that included threats of violence for several years before he
      was committed to the asylum. Walt Whitman was notified of his brother's
      death (see E. Warner's  letter).
