   <p> I have rec'd this from Dr Knortz<sup><a href="#uva.00476_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; send
      you—although he has of course notified you to same effect—I am still
      living here in my own little house, &amp; keep up fair spirits—but get
      around with great difficulty, (or rather I should say hardly at all) &amp; have
      been stricken in my eyes, which makes me partially blind &amp; growing
      worse.—Some friends have presented me with a horse &amp; wagon—so I
      get out a little every day—a young friend drives for me—I receive
      the <u>University Magazine</u>,<sup><a href="#loc.03573_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      &amp; thank you—I shall send you anything I write—(if there should
      be anything)—or whatever might interest you

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas William Hazen Rolleston
      (1857–1920) was an Irish poet and journalist. After attending college in
      Dublin, he moved to Germany for a period of time. He wrote to Whitman
      frequently, beginning in 1880, and later produced with Karl Knortz the first
      book-length translation of Whitman's poetry into German. In 1889, the collection
      <em>Grashalme: Gedichte</em> [<em>Leaves of
         Grass: Poems</em>] was published by Verlags-Magazin in Zurich, Switzerland.
      See Walter Grünzweig, <em>Constructing the German Walt
         Whitman</em> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 1995). For more
