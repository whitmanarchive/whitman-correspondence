   <p>I send a little birthday offering—5 vo. wh. I want you to use for some little comfort—private
      &amp; personal to yourself. You know you have done much to make a man of me, more than
      any other being has done, &amp; you have sent me five vols of yr works. So don't
      hesitate to accept. I am doing well in business just now. Tell Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r1">1</a></sup> that I am glad indeed to hear of the supper &amp; will help him all
      I can.

   <p>As soon as the Concord School starts up I must see about the Morse<sup><a href="#n0862" id="r2">2</a></sup> bust.
   </p>
   
   <p>I privately tell you that I don't much fancy <u>public</u>
      glorifications, &amp; wish the supper cd be <u>private</u>. It wd be
      so much more agreeable to have no newspaper blatherskiting over it.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4267">1. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">2. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,
      2006), 105–109.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="n1050">3. Wyatt Eaton (1849–1896),
      an American portrait and figure painter, organized the Society of American
      Artists in 1877. Whitman met Eaton at a reception given by Richard W. Gilder on
      June 14; see "A Poet's Recreation," <em>New York Tribune</em>,
      July 4, and <em>Walt Whitman's Diary in Canada</em>, ed. William
