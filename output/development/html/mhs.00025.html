      <br></br><br></br>Dear Lou
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Came through here all right—seems to be much as I was mentioning to you the other
      day—at any rate I feel better here now at the end than I did the two days before I
      started, &amp; on Wednesday night &amp; morning—Found it comfortable &amp; easy on the sleeping
      car—suited me perfectly—I see now that <em>you ought to have come</em>—you would have enjoyed every thing—it is really nothing difficult to come—To make
      it more interesting we had a smash about 5½ Thursday p m on our train, just escaped
      being something very bad indeed—the two locomotives all shivered to splinters—nobody
      hurt however, (only one man who jumped, the mail agent)—detained us there 2½ hours<sup><a href="#mhs.00025_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I didn't mind it at all—the last 400 miles since we did fly!—I never rode so fast
      before in my life—strangely enough too I slept quite well—only woke up every hour
      or two—When we got here in St L an hour &amp; a half ago, on alighting from the cars
          
      found Jeff waiting for me—he looks fat &amp; dark, &amp; like work—(which I guess he has plenty
      of)—We all rode immediately to the Planter's Hotel, where we were expected, &amp; have
      just had a royal breakfast, perfect beefsteak, broiled chicken, oysters, good coffee
      &amp;c—enjoyed it, for I hadn't eat any thing since yesterday at 3½—This great hotel is
      crowded with guests—the proprietor puts his private parlor &amp; room at my disposal,
      &amp; it is in it I am writing this—Jeff is coming in about an hour to take us on a long
      ride around—I shall stay with him &amp; the girls to-night—To morrow morning at 8.50 we
      start for central Kansas, 350 miles further (we are here 1000 miles from Phila:)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Lou, I will write again, what moves I make—dont exactly know—most likely I shall come
      back with Col. F soon, as I find it mighty convenient &amp; nice—every thing seen to—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Saturday—8 a m—I have been stopping at Jeffs—they are very nicely fixed—slept like
      a top—have just had a first rate breakfast—the girls are well, &amp; send love—they much
      wish you had come—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I now start in an hour for Kansas, (Lawrence) shall get there about 10 to-night</p>

   <p id="mhs.00025_n1">1. Whitman, accompanied by
      Colonel Forney (see the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of ,) left for St. Louis on September 10
      after accepting an invitation to address the Old Settlers of Kansas Committee at
      Lawrence. He arrived in St. Louis on September 12, and proceeded on the
      following day to Lawrence, where he stayed with Judge John P. Usher
      (1816–1889), Secretary of Interior in Lincoln's administration and at this
      time mayor of Lawrence (see the letter from Whitman to Usher of ).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="mhs.00025_n2">2. Whitman described this
      accident at Urbana, Ohio, in an interview in the St. Louis <em>Republican</em> on September 13 (reprinted in <em>American
