      <br></br><br></br>Dear old W.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your postal card was already forwarded to me here in this little Swedish city the
      4th and to day I received the great parcel with your
      complete works. I thank you for your love and kindness. Mr. Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r2">2</a></sup> has read my letter to you, I presume. My essay on you and my
      translation of "D. V."<sup><a href="#n4122" id="r3">3</a></sup> most surely have not run out in the
      Sand! Fare ye well, dear old Walt. If we never saw each other in "the land of
      living we shall see each other in the "land of ghosts!"
   </p>

      Truly yours

   <p id="n4267">2. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4122">3. Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> was first published in 1871 in New York by J.S.
      Redfield. The volume was an eighty-four-page pamphlet that consisted of three
      essays titled "Democracy," "Personalism," and "Orbic Literature," all of which
      Whitman intended to publish in the <em>Galaxy</em> magazine. Only
      "Democracy" and "Personalism" appeared in the magazine. For more information on
      <em>Democratic Vistas</em>, see Arthur Wrobel, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_4.html"><em>Democratic Vistas</em> [1871]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
