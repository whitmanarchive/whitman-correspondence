   <p>Your letter of 26 &amp; 27<sup><a href="#loc.07116_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> just to hand. A thousand
      thanks, dear Walt, for the first proof of the "Preface" and a thousand more for the

      destroyedð”ƒŠthe fact of it being in a <u>muss</u> does not
      matter at allâ€”the great thing is to <u>get it</u>â€”no
      matter about the state it is in.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The fall in temperature (as the season advances) is bad for you because it tends to
      check the action of the skin
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>do not forget thisâ€”the moral isâ€”attend all the more assiduously to the
      functions of this organâ€”keep well clad, above all wear flannel next the skin
      <u>all</u>
      <u>over</u> (shirt and drawers) and <u>change</u>
      <u>these</u>
      <u>frequently</u> since the flannel absorbs the secretions all
      the better the cleaner it is.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wish you could have a regular Turkish Bath once a weekâ€”it would help you very
      much. Neither do I see why this should not be arrangedâ€”of course there is no
      T.B. in Camden but there must be several in Phila and I guess you could go there as
      well as not either in your chair or by cab.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>An occasional dose of Friedrichshall, first thing in the morning, to loosen the
      bowels moderately could do no horrible harm and would proabably add to your
      comfort.

   <p>So it is to be Horticultural Hall?<sup><a href="#loc.07116_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> I hope that hall is a
      big one for as sure as a gun if the Phila friends take advantage of the situation
      as
      it stands at present there
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>will be a crowd! And don't you forget it! I wish Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r5">5</a></sup> would
      write me what they propose to do.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>They should advertise the address in the American styleâ€”for all it is worth.
      Make the biggest and loudest kind of a <u>Hurrah</u> about
      itâ€”Chaff the Pharisees and tell them to "come on!" Lord how dear old O'C.<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r6">6</a></sup> would be tickled to be in the middle of this thing!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837â€“1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4267">5. Horace L. Traubel (1858â€“1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
