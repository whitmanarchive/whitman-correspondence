      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I have received the enclosed letter today, from one of
      the ablest men I have ever known; &amp; I send it to you as another little proof
      that Irishmen understand &amp; honor you. I hope you are well. Somebody told me
      lately that you had been in Boston within a month; but I could not believe that you
      
       would have gone
      away without letting me have the pleasure of seeing you. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Bartlett<sup><a href="#n4959" id="r1">1</a></sup> is happy, &amp; busy, but he has no more money
      than he had two years ago. His son is now with him; &amp; they are finishing two
      portrait busts of rich men. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Mrs. Fairchild,<sup><a href="#har.00049_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> whom you
      will remember, is never done preaching you &amp; your work. 
   </p>

      Good bye.
      <br></br>Faithfully yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Boyle O'Reilly
      (1844–1890) was a fervent Irish patriot who joined the British Army in
      order to sabotage it. He was arrested and sentenced to be hanged in 1866. Later
      the decree was altered, and O'Reilly was sent to Australia, where he escaped on
      an American whaler in 1869. In 1876 he became the coeditor of the Boston <em>Pilot</em>, a position which he held until his death in 1890.
      See William G. Schofield, <em>Seek for a Hero: The Story of John
         Boyle O'Reilly</em> (New York: Kennedy, 1956). On  O'Reilly informed Whitman that "James R Osgood wants to see
      the material for your complete book." Whitman's letter to Osgood was written, as
      he indicated, on the verso of O'Reilly's.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4959">1. Truman Howe Bartlett
      (1835–1923), an instructor in modelling at the Massachusetts Institute of
      Technology, was characterized by William Vaughan Moody as "a magnificent old
      goat and man of God . . . passing hours with immortal phrases"; see Hermann
      Hagedorn, <em>Edwin Arlington Robinson</em> (New York: Macmillan,
      1938), 254. Bartlett evidently affected the Whitman pose with his open collar
      and flowing tie. On , Bartlett
      informed Whitman that "the cast of your hand I shall soon send to Paris to be
      cast in bronze." The plaster cast is in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.; a bronze cast is at Yale. Probably
      Whitman met Bartlett at the poet's close friend Colonel John R. Johnston's home
      on September 1, 1878 (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="har.00049_n3">2. Elizabeth Fairchild was
      the wife of Colonel Charles Fairchild, the president of a paper company, to whom
      Whitman sent the Centennial Edition on March 2, 1876 (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). He mailed her husband a
      copy of <em>Progress</em> in April, 1881, shortly after his visit
      to Boston, where he probably met the Fairchilds for the first time (Commonplace
      Book).<a href="#r2">[back]
