      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>This morning I mail with this a letter to you from Mother and also a letter to George
      from Mother. I suppose Mother has told you fully abt Andrew. My own opinion is that he will not recover, that he cannot last long. However
      I think that it is owning more to the circumstances that surround him than to his
      disease. There is no use trying to disguise the matter, Andrew is very unfortunately
      situated in regard to his home. His wife, I guess is not one of the doing kind, and
      posessed with rather an ugly high temper.<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> His disease of course makes Andrew fretful and discouraged, and instead of soothing
      and nursing him Nancy does the reverse. As to his disease I really think that had
      I the same disease that I could recover from it.<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> However I dont know. I sincerely wish that you would come hom for a short time anyway. I think that you could do Andrew a great deal of good &nbsp;In
      the letter<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> that Mother received yesterday from you, you speak abt my having been reduced in pay. I am sorry Mother wrote you abt it for it only worries you without doing any good, and another thing it is not like
      you think in regard to cutting down my wages. I was working for the two boards of
      Commissioners, one at $40 and the other at $50 per month, and I have got all the work
      for one board finished (the one at $40) [and?] as the Sal. of the office I hold for the Permanent board (that of Map clerk at $50) is put down
      in their annual appropriation at $50 why of course I have to get along with it for
      the present. It is not the meanness<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> or anything of that kind of anybody and they would pay me more if they could and
      will probably in a short time. I shall get some appointment again from the old board
      I have no doubt, and soon too. As to the worry part, I never think of that &nbsp;A man
      with a wife like I have got cant worry even if he wanted to. Give yourself no thought
      abt my worring. Something that I have got entirely past.<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I have every reason to think that the Commissioners (both boards) think well of me,
      and I know that Mr Lane<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> will ever do everything in his power for me, and I undoubtedly in a short time shall
      be getting more.
   </p>
   
   <p>In regard to the Pacific R. R.<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I am real obliged to you. I learned this morning that our friend J. W. Adams<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> was appointed chief and I've no doubt but I could get a place at once on it, yet
      I think that in the end I will make more by staying where I am but its rather pleasant
      to have that to fall back on. I wish you would write me &nbsp;Ruggles<sup><a href="#loc.00427_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> sends his regards.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00427_n1">1. In her letter to Walt
      Whitman of October 30 (?), 1863, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman condemned Nancy's
      inactivity more explicitly: "i asked him [Andrew} to day what nancy was dooing
      if she was dooing any sewing...i dont know but i think she is about the lazyest
      and dirtiest woman i ever want to see...shes as ugly as she is dirty &nbsp;i dont
      wonder he used to drink" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare
      Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n2">2. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from .<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n3">3. See Walt Whitman's
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n4">4. Walt Whitman had
      referred to the waterworks people as "mean old punkin heads" and "mean low-lived
      old shoats" for reducing Jeff's pay after "faithful &amp;...really valuable"
      work (see Whitman's letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from ).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n5">5. This is one of a number
      of oblique references in the family correspondence to a period when Jeff's
      emotional state was less stable. Such references support the idea that Jeff's
      illness in the mid-1850s may have been psychosomatic. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from .<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n6">6. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from .<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n7">7. Perhaps Walt Whitman
      sent Jeff additional volumes of the Pacific Railroad reports (see Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from ).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00427_n8">8. A member of the Adams
      family of Boston, Julius Walker Adams (1812–99) distinguished himself as
      an engineer working on both railroads and water systems. He designed the
      Brooklyn sewer system, the first one in America constructed on a general plan
      according to scientific principles, and is credited with having drawn up the
      first plans for the Brooklyn Bridge (1866). He also commanded the Fifty-sixth
      Regiment of the Brooklyn National Guard which defended the <em>New
         York Times</em> and <em>Tribune</em> offices during the draft
      riots of July 1863. He wrote several standard textbooks on engineering and
      served as chief engineer of Brooklyn from 1869 to 1877 and president of the
      American Society of Civil Engineers from 1873 to 1875. There is no evidence that
      he worked for any of the Pacific Railroad companies.<a href="#r8">[back]
