      <br></br><br></br>My dear Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Why have I not written to you? Why has not Spring come?</p>
   
   
   <p>I have waited for that, waiting a little also till I could get through some work
      which would have made me uncompanionable. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Now—I go to New York on Saturday June 5 to the
      Century meeting and remain in 
      NY
      
       till Tuesday or Wednesday after. Can not you meet me, so as to return home
      with me? Apple blossoms surely will be out by then, and some summer warmth to enable
      you to enjoy your hammock (did I tell you? I have one?) on the piazza.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   
   <p>I want you here and to set you to rights. Can you come then (not for a night or two
      but to stay <u>indefinitely</u>), or will you rather come
      later?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Do which may best suit you, but come; and let me know as near as you can when I may
      look for you.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."
