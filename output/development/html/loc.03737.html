      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you
      the estimate of you I
      had room to publish
      last year in one of 
      our most important Reviews,
      <u>La Nouvelle Revue</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.03737_n8" id="r2">2</a></sup> Unfortunately
      the essay is not complete;
      I was obliged to shorten
      it, as it is often the
      case, when one writes
      for periodicals, and I would
      not myself encroach on
      the space devoted to the
      work of other contributors;
      but my second series
      of English and American
      poets will soon appear
      in book form, and there
      will I print all I 
      wrote first about you, to 
      the full extent.
   </p>
   
   <p>Did you
      hear a lady friend of
      mine, Madame Blanc-Bentzon<sup><a href="#loc.03737_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      reviewed "Leaves of Grass"
      in the <u>Revue des Deux — Mondes</u><sup><a href="#loc.03737_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup>?
      She did it ten or fifteen 
      years ago, I don't remember  
      exactly the date, and the 
      same book was also reviewed 
      four years ago by Madame 
      Léo Quesnel,<sup><a href="#n5001" id="r5">5</a></sup> in the <u>Revue 
         Politique et Litteràire</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.03737_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup> Lately, a
      young writer, M. Francis Vielé–Griffin<sup><a href="#loc.03737_n5" id="r7">7</a></sup> translated
      <u>Faces</u> in a less known
      periodical, <u>La Revue indépendante</u><sup><a href="#loc.03737_n6" id="r8">8</a></sup>;
      and I have been told
      another young poet, who
      died five years ago, M. 
      Jules Laforgue,<sup><a href="#loc.03737_n7" id="r9">9</a></sup> translated,
      I know not where, <u>A Woman
         Waits for me</u>. I cannot
      procure easily the essays
      or translations; but for 
      that, I should have
      forwarded them to you.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Gabriel Sarrazin (1853–1935)
      was a translator and poet from France, who commented positively not only on
      Whitman's work but also on Poe's. Whitman later corresponded with Sarrazin and
      apparently liked the critic's work on <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>—Whitman even had Sarrazin's chapter on his book translated
      twice. For more on Sarrazin, see Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_208.html">Sarrazin, Gabriel (1853–1935)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03737_n1">1. This letter is addressed: Etats Unis d'Amerique | Walt Whitman, 
      Middle Street, Camden, New Jersey U.S.A. It is postmarked: Paris 42 |[illegible] 7 | JANV | 89 | AV. FRIEDLAND; New York |

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03737_n8">2. Sarrazin is referring to his
      essay "Poétes modernes de l'Amérique: Whitman," which was published in <em>La
         Nouvelle Revue</em> 52 (May 1888), 164–84. Here, Sarrazin explains to
      Whitman that while the essay had been abridged in the journal, the excised
      portions would be restored when printed in <em>La renaissance de
         la poésie anglaise</em>. See Roger Asselineau's article in
      <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 5 (1959), 8–11. After receiving Sarrazin's letter,
      Whitman then asked William Sloane Kennedy and Richard Maurice Bucke to make an abstract
      in English of Sarrazin's
      essay (see Whitman's letter to Kennedy of
      , and to Bucke of ). Sarrazin's piece is reprinted in
      an English translation by Harrison S. Morris in <em>In Re Walt
         Whitman</em> (1893, pp. 159–194).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.03737_n2">3. Thérèse Blanc (1840–1907), under her psuedonym 
      Thérèse Bentzon, was an author, translator, and literary critic who is specifically
      noted for her expertise 
      on American literary works and her subsequent writings for the <em>Revue de Deux Mondes</em> (Karen 
      Offen, <em>Debating the Woman Question in the French Third Republic, 1870–1920</em> [Cambridge 
      University Press, 2018], 189–190).<a href="#r3">[back]

      this person.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="loc.03737_n4">6. In February of 1884, Quesnel declared that the 
      <em>Leaves</em> are untranslatable and that Whitman is not enough of an artist to appeal to Quesnel's
      
      countrymen (P. Mansell Jones, <em>The Background of Modern French Poetry</em> [Cambridge University 
      Press, 1951], 71).<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="loc.03737_n5">7. Francis Vielé(1864–1937) was born in America, moving 
      to Paris with his mother when his parents divorced in 1870. He was a French symbolist
      poet and literary critic known
      for creating controversy such as when a slighting remark about Catulle Mendès led
      to him being wounded in a 
      duel in 1891 (Reinhard Clifford Kuhn, <em>The Return to Reality a Study of Francis Vielé-griffin</em> 
      [Librairie E. Droz and Librairie Minard, 1962]).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="loc.03737_n7">9. Jules Laforgue (1860–1887) was a Franco-Uruguayan 
      poet who died of tuberculosis at twenty–seven shortly after his first published poetry,
