      <br></br><br></br>Dear Baxter—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>the book is out &amp; 1st edition quite exhausted<sup><a href="#nyp.00446_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you same mail with this a paper-bound copy of "Specimen Days" for your
      printing office use—will send you a regularly bound copy in a day or
      two—the volume is issued in precisely the same style as "Leaves of
      Grass"—same cloth binding, same butterfly on the back, same size,
      &amp;c.—It is a great jumble (as a man himself is)—Is an autobiography
      after its sort—(sort o' synonyms &amp; yet altogether
      different—"Montaigne," Rousseau's "Confessions" &amp;c)—is the gathering
      up, &amp; formulation, &amp; putting in identity of the wayward itemizings,
      memoranda, and personal notes of fifty years, under modern &amp; American
      conditions, a good deal helter-skelter but I am sure a certain sort of orbic
      compaction and oneness the final result—dwells long in its own peculiar way on
      the Secession War—gives glimpses of that event's strange interiors, especially
      the Army Hospitals—in fact makes the resuscitating and putting on record the
      <em>emotional aspect</em> of the war of 1861–'65 one of its
      principal features.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The years from 1876 to the present date Whitman has been a partial paralytic. Very
      much of his days—(and nights also as it appears)—he has spent in the
      open air down in the country in the woods and fields, and by a secluded little New
      Jersey river—His memoranda on the spot of these days and nights fill a goodly
      portion of the Volume—Then comes the "Collect," embodying "Democratic Vistas,"
      the Preface to 
      L of G.
      
       of 1855, and much other prose.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It is understood that Whitman himself considers "Specimen Days" the exponent and
      finish of his poetic work "Leaves of Grass," that each of the two volumes is
      indispensable in his view to the other, and that both together finally begin and
      illustrate his literary schemes in the New World. Talking lately in a half jocular
      vein to a friend he termed them his Adam and Eve, sent out in "this garden the
      world."

   <p>(don't fail to copy this—can't it conclude your notice?)<sup><a href="#nyp.00446_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>Four 
      Phila:
      
       editions of "Leaves of Grass" have been issued &amp; sold within the last
      three months—they are now on the fifth—The first edition of "Specimen
      Days" has been exhausted in less than a week. They are now on the <em>second</em>—

   <p>Dear B, if you notice—send me a paper—don't fail—Send also one each
      to
      
      <br><br>Wm D O'Connor,
      Life Saving Services Washington D C
      <br>Dr. R M Bucke, London, Ontario, Canada

   <p>Dear B
      I have 
      dash'd
      
       off all this to help you—to use (incorporate) or not as you think
      fit—you will understand—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Of course use whatever of this you want—incorporate it I mean in your
      article.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00446_n4">1. This letter is addressed:
      Sylvester Baxter | Daily Herald | newspaper office | Boston Mass:. It is
      postmarked: Camden | (?) | 8 | 6 PM | N.J.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00446_n1">2. On  Whitman informed O'Connor that of 1500
      copies of <em>Specimen Days</em> 400 remained unsold. Perhaps he
      referred to a second printing; more probably Whitman overstated the success of
      the volume so that Baxter would have good copy for his review in the Boston <em>Herald</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00446_n2">3. This notation refers to
      the preceding paragraph, which Baxter included verbatim in the second to last
      paragraph of his "review" of <em>Specimen Days</em> in the Boston
      <em>Herald</em> on October 15. Baxter quoted from the first
      paragraph of Whitman's letter but then incorporated the rest of the letter
      without indicating the source.<a href="#r3">[back]
