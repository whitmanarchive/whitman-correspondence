      real good boy and deserves to do well. All quiet here, Mr. Pardee<sup><a href="#n4274" id="r2">2</a></sup> continues to do well. I think I shall certainly leave here next Monday and  see you Wednesday or
      Thursday—I shall stay at Dooner's as usual shall be there from the station so
      if you should want to send any word to me you will catch me there as soon as I reach
      the city. Very wet weather here the last few days, I am beginning to fear we shall
      have bad weather &amp; bad roads for the Presidents visit—that would be a
      pity. I am having a first class time here quiet and pleasant. Have not had such a
       thorough good <u>rest</u> as I am getting now for years—we have a
      splendid bay here and every few days I set out for a good sail on it, they have
      capital sail boats.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
