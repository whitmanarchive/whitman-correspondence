      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir:<sup xmlns=""><a href="#prc.00020_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I thank you for the copy of my poems sent by you. It has just reached me. I consider
      it a beautiful volume. The portrait, as given in it, is, however, a marked blemish.
      I was thinking, if you wish to have a portrait, you might like to own the original
      plate of 1855 which I believe I can procure, in good order, &amp; from which you can
      print a frontispice more creditable—as per impression enclosed. If so, send
      me word immediately. The price of the plate would probably be $40. gold—or
      8 pounds. It would suit just such a volume, &amp; would coincide entirely with the
      text in note &amp; preface, as they now stand. If I receive your favorable response,
      I will, if possible, procure the plate, &amp; send it to you by express—on
      receipt of which, &amp; not before, you can send me the money. (I have sent to New
      York to see if I can procure the plate, &amp; have not yet received any
      answer.)<sup><a href="#prc.00020_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will thank you to convey to Mr. Swinburne my heartiest acknowledgements for the
      copy of William Blake, (which has reached me)—&amp; for his kind &amp;
      generous mention of me in it.<sup><a href="#prc.00020_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="prc.00020_n1">1. Thomas Hotten
      (1832–1873) printed Swinburne's <em>Poems and Ballads</em>
      when another publisher withdrew after the book caused a furor. Perhaps because
      he had lived in the United States from 1848 to 1856, Hotten introduced to an
      English audience such writers as Lowell, Artemus Ward, Oliver Wendell Holmes,
      and Bret Harte. After his death, his business was purchased by Chatto and
      Windus. In his letter to Conway on December 5, 1866, O'Connor had suggested
      Hotten as the English publisher of Walt Whitman: "Seems to me the courage that
      prints Laus Veneris might dare this" (Yale).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="prc.00020_n2">2. Walt Whitman discussed the
      frontispiece in greater detail in his  letter to John Camden Hotten.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="prc.00020_n3">3. Swinburne, at the
      conclusion of <em>William Blake: A Critical Essay</em> (London:
      John Camden Hotten, 1868), 300–303, pointed out similarities between
      Whitman and Blake, and praised "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" and "When
      Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd," which he termed "the most sweet and
      sonorous nocturn ever chanted in the church of the world." Included in <em>Songs before Sunrise</em> (1871) was his famous lyric "To Walt
      Whitman in America." For the story of Swinburne's veneration of Walt Whitman and
      his later recantation, see Harold Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in
         England</em> (Cornell: Cornell University Press, 1934),
      103–121.<a href="#r3">[back]
