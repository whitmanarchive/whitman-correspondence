   <p>Just 
      rec'd
      
       your postal card—(your letter of a month ago from Haslemere 
      rec'd
      
      —both forwarded here)<sup><a href="#loc.02140_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Two months
      ago I started off (make or break) on a long jaunt west—have been to the Rocky
      Mountains (2000 miles) and Denver city, &amp; Colorado generally,—with Kansas
      and Missouri—wonders, revelations I wouldn't have miss'd for my life, the
      great central area 2000 miles square, the Prairie States <u>the real
         America</u> I find, (&amp; I find that I wasn't realizing it before)—but
      three weeks ago I was taken down sick &amp; have come back &amp; stopt here in St
      Louis ever since—am quite comfortable in quarters &amp; shall soon be well
      enough to return home to Camden—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a rude map which will show you the line of my jaunt—the red lines are
      of my present trip, while the blue lines are of former journeys of mine, may
      interest you, &amp; give you some idea<sup><a href="#loc.02140_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I shall probably be able to send you papers of my jottings before long—(my
      sickness has prevented hitherto what I designed to write)<sup><a href="#loc.02140_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—My sister, brother &amp; nieces all well—

   <p id="loc.02140_n2">2. Anne Gilchrist's post
      card of  contained her address (<em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 7 [1961], 12). In her letter of  she noted a recent luncheon with
      Tennyson and the preparation of a new edition of her husband's <em>Life of William Blake</em> (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      147–148).<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.02140_n3">3. The map is reproduced by
      Herbert Harlakenden Gilchrist in <em>Anne Gilchrist: Her Life and
         Writings</em> (London: T.F. Unwin, 1887), 253. Of this map Anne Gilchrist
      wrote to Whitman on : "You could not
      easily realize the strong emotion, with which I read your last note and traced
      on the little map—a most precious possession to me which I would not part
      with for the whole world—all your journeyings—both in youth &amp;
      now" (<em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em>, ed.
      Thomas B. Harned [New York: Doubleday, Page &amp; Company, 1918]).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="loc.02140_n4">4. As his health improved,
      Whitman wrote articles for various newspapers. On November 12, 1879 he sent a
      letter to Joseph B. Marvin, a friend in Washington, with a "piece" for Frank
      Brett Noyes, the editor of the Washington <em>Star</em>. "A Poet's
      Western Trip" appeared in the <em>Star</em> on November 15. On
      November 20 he forwarded a "piece" to Bartram Bonsall, the editor of the Camden
      <em>Daily Post</em>, perhaps the item on November 29 referring
      to a volume of prose based on his Western journey. In a letter to Erastus
      Brainerd on December 9 he enclosed a poem, "What Best I See in Thee," and a
      "¶ for Personal—in answer to request"; they appeared in the
      Philadelphia <em>Press</em> on December 17. See <em>Walt Whitman Review</em>, 7 (1961), 10, 12.<a href="#r4">[back]
