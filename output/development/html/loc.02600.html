      <br></br><br></br>Dear W.W.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I send you by this mail my paper—"The New Ars Poetica"<sup><a href="#loc.02600_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>I want you to read it, &amp;, if you think best, ask McKay<sup><a href="#syr.00031_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> to bring it out for us.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have a strong &amp; even strange feeling of the educative and epoch-making nature
      of your style (poetical); &amp; I am confident that my essay will do great good. I
      want all the chief American &amp; especially the English poets to have copies.
      Nothing in the world, I believe, stands so much in 
       the way of the
      greater sale of 
      yr
      
       "Leaves" as the idea among people that your style is ridiculous &amp;
      unpoetical. The laugh, I find, is always raised by this the first thing. If [
      <span class="unclear">they 
         cd
         
         ?</span>]
       have good authority or rendered reason &amp; proof that the
      style was true to nature &amp; good in itself, other difficulties 
      wd
      
       easily melt away.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have examined all literary sources, but have had to work out the subject—in
      the main, by slow &amp; painful original steps. What do you think of my performance?
      I wish the [
      <span class="unclear">libret?</span>]
       might even be bound. It ought to sell a small edition. Can you
      interest some moneyed fellow in it? 
   </p>

   <p>Last p.</p>
   
   <p>Can't you write me something yourself on the all important subject? Come: <u>that</u>
      
      wd
      
       sell the brochure sure. <u>Write it to me, say, in
         the form of a letter which I then print by 
         yr
         
          permission. Do you see?</u></p>
   
   <p>Do exert yourself in the matter if you feel able. I believe it 
      wd
      
       give you a money return. We shd get people to talking at a great rate. <u>Especially</u> if you are quoted as saying something
      philosophical on the subject; something new, in addition to that in preface
      &amp;

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02600_n1">1. "The New Ars Poetica" was
      Kennedy's attempt at defending Walt Whitman's poetic style. On  he accepted Whitman's suggestion of
      expanding his article. The essay became part of <em>The Poet as A
         Craftsman</em> (see the letter from Whitman to Kennedy of ).<a href="#r1">[back]
