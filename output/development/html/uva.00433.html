      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sister Lou
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing very new &amp; I suppose George has written to you, as he returned
      about 6 p m yesterday all right—but I thought I would drop a line<sup><a href="#uva.00433_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>Of course the shooting of President Garfield<sup><a href="#uva.00433_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is the
      general subject, &amp; has depressed me much, but for the last twenty four hours,
      his case is so much more favorable—We had the most horrible <em>celebration</em> here I ever knew, commenced at dark Sunday night, continued
      all night &amp; of course next day, ruffians yelling, crackers, and all the old guns
      &amp; pistols of all Jersey, with all the bad elements of humanity completely let
      loose &amp; making the most infernal din possible to conceive for over thirty hours
      without a moments intermission—Over in Philadelphia perfectly quiet, (all the
      bad stuff probably came over here)—very hot indeed here the last four days,
      &amp; continues still—I am standing it well—I take my meals at Mrs
      Wroth's<sup><a href="#uva.00433_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> &amp; find it a very good place—it was
      a good move, my going there—Mrs W is very kind—Tip has been all right
      &amp; has had his meals regular—a little off his feed &amp; off <em>his bark</em> this morning, I suppose from the great heat, &amp;
      folks away—Arthur Stanley lives now over at the Chevaliers, with his new
      wife<sup><a href="#uva.00433_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—his little boy 
      bro't
      
       me over a nice piece of wedding cake Sunday which I took down to Alice
      Wroth<sup><a href="#uva.00433_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>The <em>house</em> is all right so far—I try to keep as cool as
      I can—what with bathing &amp; ventilation, &amp; of course you will find some
      litter when you come back—
   </p>
   
   <p>I send some <em>Ledgers</em>—I am writing this in the dining
      room, by open window—George was writing early forenoon, but has gone
      out—Tip has commenced a good barking at last (11½ oclock) after being
      quiet all the forenoon—I was afraid something was the matter with
      him—
   </p>
   
   <p>I am busy five or six hours yet every day with the copy of my book—hard work to
      get it in the shape I want it.
   </p>
   
   <p>As I finish it is after noon &amp; very hot &amp; oppressive—Love to you &amp;
      all—tell little Amy<sup><a href="#uva.00433_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> I have not forgotten her,
      &amp; that I am going to give Tip a nice sweet coffee-cake for his
      dinner—George has just returned—
