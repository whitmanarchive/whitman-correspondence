   <p>Would it be convenient to the President to personally request of the Attorney General
      that 
      in any changes in the Solicitor Treasury's office, I be not disturbed in my position
      as clerk 
      in that officeâ€”all my duties to the government being &amp; having been thoroughly &amp; regularly
      
      performed there, by a substitute,<sup><a href="#nar.03603_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> during my illness.

   <p id="nar.03603_n2">2. Whitman was evidently aware that a bill
      approved by Congress on June 20, 1874, required a reduction of personnel in the
      Department of Justice. Whitman's letter was sent by Grant's secretary to the
      Attorney General on July 26, 1874. It was accompanied by a clipping from the
      Camden <em>New Republic</em> of June 20, 1874, which included
      "Song of the Universal" and Whitman's (anonymous) comments on his illness.
      Wecter conjectures that Whitman had the article printed "with the hope that it
      might catch Grant's eye more effectually than would a letter"; see <em>PMLA</em>, 58 (1943), 1108.<a href="#r2">[back]
