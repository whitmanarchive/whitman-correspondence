      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Have you perhaps still any copies left of John Burroughs'<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r1">1</a></sup> book "Notes on Whitman"? If
      so, will you send me one? I enclose $1, and postage. A fellow-worker of mine in the
      Cornell University Library, Mr. E. H. Woodruff,<sup><a href="#loc.01336_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> visited you in the early spring, and
      brought back a copy of the book I have been interested in for some months. I am glad
      to say that my interest is not confined to the books written about you. I wish I
      could tell you, without seeming to manufacture phrases, what a revelation your two
      volumes, the prose collection and the poems, have been to me. My love for them is
      growing constantly, and my gratitude to the friend who first made you known to me,
      is very great.
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Mr. Woodruff is away now, but I think he said the price of the little "Notes" was
      $1. If this
      is not right, I will send the rest at once.
   </p>

      Very truly yours,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0129">1. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.01336_n1">2. Edwin H. Woodruff
      (1863–1941), then a member of the staff of the Cornell University Library,
      was introduced to the poet by Hiram Corson in a letter of . Two days later he was in Camden
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). Earlier,
      on , Woodruff had sent Whitman a poem
      written under his influence and printed in the Cornell <em>Era</em>. Later Woodruff became a professor of law and was dean of the
      Cornell Law School from 1916 to 1921. See Cornell University, <em>Faculty. Necrology of the Faculty, 1941–1942</em>, 5–7.<a href="#r2">[back]
