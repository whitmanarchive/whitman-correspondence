      <br></br><br></br>Kind Friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As you requested me to write you after leaving the Hospital. I will do so for the
      first time. My wishes are that this may find you enjoying good health and plenty of
      kind friends to associate with.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have not been over to Armory Square Hospital since leaveing itâ€”. But have been expecting
      to call there and also to see you The orders here are very strict  no one is allowed
      out side of Camp without a pass and the passes are scarse
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I shall manage to see you before I leave for the front if possible We are to get our
      horses in a day or so, and then be off to joine our Regiments
   </p>
   
   <p>The News are dull concerning the movements of the Army but for all that we expect
      to hear of a hard fought Battle before long. I think that we will be sent out as reenforcements so much the better
   </p>
   
   <p>Now Uncle I hope you will not believe that I had or have forgoten you. I will write again when at the front &amp; perhaps have something more worth writing about. I will close by expecting to have a better opportunity of writing some
      thing else when you hear from me again My health is good at present
   </p>

      believe me ever your friend

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"Little Mitch," or Reuben
      Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in
      Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
      1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the
      correspondence was renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On
      March 5, 1875, Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old
      Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the
      days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter,
      on August 16, 1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for
      California. Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection. He is
      mentioned in <em>Memoranda During the War</em> (see <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 10 vols. [New
      York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134). When Bucke wrote to Farwell after Walt
      Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the back of a
      circular," was extant (Miller). For Farwell's other correspondence with Whitman
