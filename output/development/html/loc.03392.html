      <br></br><br></br>Dear Sir  
      
   </p>
   
   <p>This sample of your binding (old fashion'd pocket-book style with ordinary tongue
      or
      tuck-flap, all holding snug, but not too tight or stiff) is satisfactory &amp; suits
      me best.<sup><a href="#loc.03392_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The dark green morocco, if you have it already, will do—but if you
      have to get it get <u>a lighter green</u>. Bind the whole ed'n
      alike, no variety. Make a stout paper pocket—(see last page, as written on in
      sample)—In trimming the plates, &amp;c. (if yet to be done) trim them,
      especially No: 1 and No: 4, leaving a little <u>more</u> white paper
      at bottom, &amp; <u>less</u> at top, the trimming in this
      sample seems to me to be the very reverse—
   </p>
   
   <p>The plates are all put in right in this sample—the stamp on cover is
      right—&amp; altogether the job looks satisfactory. <u>I
         particularly want 50 copies (or 100) in a week</u>.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Frederick Oldach (1823–1907)
      was a German bookbinder whose Philadelphia firm bound Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> (1888) and <em>Complete
         Poems &amp; Prose</em> (1888), as well as the special seventieth-birthday
      issue of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1889).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.03392_n1">1.  Whitman had a limited and
      autographed pocket-book edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      printed in honor of his 70th birthday, on May 31, 1889, through special
      arrangement with Frederick Oldach. Only 300 copies were printed, and Whitman
      signed the title page of each one. The volume also included the annex <em>Sands at Seventy</em> and his essay <em>A
         Backward Glance O'er Traveled Roads</em>. For more information on the book
