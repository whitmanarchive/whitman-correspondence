      <br xmlns="" class="opener">June 29, 1882.
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p>'Rah! I have yours of yesterday. It is just delightful to know you have a
      publisher, or rather publishers, though I have felt sure from the turn things have
      taken within two or
      
      
      three days, that you will not want for publication. I am sure
      there is going to be a big row.
   </p>
   
   <p>Rees, Welsh &amp; Co. promise well. Only be sure your contracts are in form. Will it
      be advisable to have a long contract? You <u>may</u> have a better offer yet.
      
      
      I hope Rees,
      Welsh &amp; Co only have <u>life</u>. If they take advantage of the present uproar, and
      advertise you on the crest of this wave, they may secure a great sale. A publisher
      with money, ardently believing in your book, "fresh, vehement and true," as Thomas
      Davis says the
      
      
      Irish guard were at Fontenoy, devoted to your interest, and on the <u>qui vive</u> to turn everything to swell the fame of his
      venture, might effect a sale which would be tremendous.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am delighted at your
      prospect.
   </p>
   
   <p>I earnestly hope
      
      
      they will print Bucke's book also. It will help. I wrote for him, in a whirl of
      bitter work and many cares, a long helter-skelter sort of an introduction, for my
      old
      pamphlet, which he was to print as an appendix. He thought my prolegomena good,
      
      
      and I was sorry I
      could not make it better, but if Rees, Welsh &amp; Co. publish his book, I will
      strive to refurbish my contribution and make it better.
   </p>
   
   <p>Dr. Channing wrote me from Providence a fortnight ago, in great indignation at
      
      
      what had been
      done to you, and proposed to reprint "The Good Gray Poet" in Boston at his expense.
      I explained (did I tell you this?) that I had promised the republication to Bucke
      and could not in honor take it away from him. Besides, I felt it would not be as
      timely as I could wish. The thing
      
      
      for a pamphlet will be my letters
      upon Oliver Stevens and company, when we get to a stopping point, which will be some
      time during the summer. I propose to print them under the caption, "The Suppression
      of Leaves of Grass," and they will make a good tender or pilot-fish to your
      
      
      
      publishers'
      venture.
   </p>
   
   <p>After long cogitation, I have concluded, from internal evidence, and feel that I can't
      be mistaken, that "Sigma" is simply Stoddard, and I am going to answer him now and
      give him hell. The way I shall manage it, I think you will approve.
      
      
      The <u>rationale</u>
      of his infamous communication, is to give a
      basis through the vilest calumniation, to the tottering action of Oliver Stevens
      and Marston. I mean to point out this fact, and exterminate his effort, announcing
      that I do so simply as preliminary
      
      
      to the arraignment of Marston, who
      has thus far escaped scourging, but shall presently know the meaning of the word
      knout. Then I shall go for Marston.
   </p>
   
   <p>Also Tobey, the Boston postmaster. He shall have
      a sample of the Day of Judgment. When I heard that George
      
      
      Chainey's lecture on you had been
      suppressed, I at once wrote to him and got the facts by telegraph. Then I went to
      see Col. Ingersoll, and we had a red-hot time over the outrage, and arranged for a
      session with the Postmaster General on the subject. Today, we have seen him, and
      Ingersoll was magnificent. The Postmaster had, however,
      
      
      
      heard nothing of the matter (you
      will understand this chenanigan when you read the accompanying copy of a letter I
      have just received from Chainey) and said Chainey must write him a letter. So we
      telegraph to Chainey accordingly, and this afternoon Ingersoll
      
      
      will concoct a
      letter to the P.M. General, with my assistance, and we will put in a copy of
      this letter of Chainey's. I think we can manage Howe, which will score heavily for
      us in the game.
   </p>
   
   <p>I'll keep you posted. Pretty soon, I will have a petition started in Boston for the
      
      
      removal of
      Tobey; also Marston and Stevens. This will make Rome howl. Even if we can't effect
      the ruin of these scoundrels, it will make a prodigious uproar to roll up several
      thousand signatures against their retention, and meanwhile I will subject them to
      the
      
      noble art of
      composition, and my pen will blacken them forever.
   </p>
   
   <p>Depend upon it, we are going to have music. I hope I shall see everything the press
      has. I saw the Boston Sunday Herald, with your rendition poem printed with splendid
      effect. Shall watch the Boston papers. Charley was going up to Boston, and would
      have made me an exhaustive report on the <u>roots</u> of the matter, but unluckily has been
      ordered to Memphis. Too bad!
   </p>

      Good bye.
