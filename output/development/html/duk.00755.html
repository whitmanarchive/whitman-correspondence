      <br></br><br></br>Dear dear brother
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Again I am ashamed of myself for not writing to you before as I have received so many
      letters from you and always think I will answer but one thing and another keeps me
      from it so now I will try to tell you about myself well we jog along in about the
      old way sometimes it is nip and tuck with us sometimes nips ahead and 
      sometimees
      
       tuck but in the main we are all right as long as I only have my health
      Ansel has been out of work for a year but has work now so we are all right I often
      hear from you through the papers and am glad enough to think you are better this
      winter  and hope
      and pray you will entirely recover and believe you will and would like very much to
      see you whenever you feel as if you could come or any of the rest of my folks and
      will do all I can to make it pleasant for them Our family of children live here
      around us Minnie has three children and Fanny one the rest have none Greenport is
      about the same as it was when you was here only improved very much and now dear
      brother I want to thank you for the many letters cards and papers you have sent me
      and likewise for the christmas present you sent in the letter and want you to write
      whenever you can for you are the only one now since dear mother left us that ever
      writes a word to me Please when you write  again mention how Eddy and 
      hannah
      
       Jeff George and all get along as I should like to hear from them and I do
      think I will not be so long in answering again. I suppose you have almost forgotten
      how it looks here Louisa and John have built a new house opposite here and are
      living in it Minnie's husband has bought one a little further off and they are
      living in that. I 
      dont
      
       know as this will interest you but I thought I would just write it. I feel
      myself growing old and failing every day but my health has been better this winter
      than usual
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Dear Brother one more favor I would like to ask of you that is when you have time
      to
      please copy our family record<sup><a href="#duk.00755_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> and send to me  as I really have
      forgotten how old we all are
   </p>

      From your affectionate sister

   <p id="duk.00755_n2">1. The year 1889 has been
      written at the top of this page in an unknown hand, struck through, and replaced
      by the year 1875. Our dating of the letter as 1878 is based on the information
      in the note below and the list of incoming correspondence in Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>, ed. Ted Genoways (Iowa City, IA:
      University of Iowa Press, 2004), 7:145.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="duk.00755_n1">2. Whitman wrote the family
      "Births," "Marriages," and "Deaths" in a Bible and sent it to Mary as a
      Christmas gift in 1878 (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections</em>,
      ed. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver [Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press,
      1949], 6â€“8).<a href="#r2">[back]
