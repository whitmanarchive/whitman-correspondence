      <br></br><br></br>Dear W.S.K.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>It is of no importance whether I had read Emerson before starting L. of G. or
      not.<sup><a href="#med.00753_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> The fact happens to be positively that I had
      <em>not</em>. The basis and body and genesis of the L[eaves] differing I suppose from
      Em[erson]<sup><a href="#n1044" id="r2">2</a></sup> and many grandest poets and artists[—]was and is that I found and
      find everything in the <em>common concrete</em>, the broadcast
      materials, the flesh, the common passions, the tangible and visible, etc., and in
      <em>the average</em>, and that I radiate, work from, these
      outward—or rather hardly wish to leave here but to remain and celebrate it
      all. Whatever the amount of this may be or not be, it is certainly <em>not Emersonian</em>, 
      not Shakspere, not Tennyson—indeed, the antipodes of
      E. and the others in essential respects. But I have not suggested or exprest myself
      well in my book unless I have in a sort included them and their sides and
      expressions too—as this orb the world means and includes all climes, all
      sorts, L. of G.'s word is <em>the body, including all</em>, including
      the intellect and soul; E.'s word is mind (or intellect or soul).
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If I were to unbosom to you in the matter I should say that I never cared so very
      much for E.'s writings, prose or poems, but from his first personal visit and two
      hours with me (in Brooklyn in 1866 or '65?)<sup><a href="#med.00753_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup> I had a
      strange attachment and love for <em>him</em> and his contact, talk,
      company, magnetism. I welcomed <em>him</em> deepest and
      always—yet it began and continued <em>on his part</em>, quite
      entirely; HE always sought ME. We probably had a dozen (possibly twenty) of these
      meetings, talks, walks, etc.—some five or six times (sometimes New York,
      sometimes Boston) had good long dinners together. I was very happy—I don't
      think I was at my best with him—he always did most of the talking—I am
      sure he was happy too. That visit to me at Sanborn's, by E. and family, and the
      splendid formal-informal family dinner <em>to me</em>, next day,
      Sunday, Sept. 18, '81, by E., Mrs. E. and all, I consider not only a victor-event
      in
      my life,<sup><a href="#med.00753_n3" id="r4">4</a></sup> but it is an after-explanation of so much and
      offered as an apology, peace-offering, justification, of much that the world knows
      not of. My dear friend, I think I know R.W.E. better than anybody else knows
      him—and loved him in proportion, but quietly. Much was revealed to me.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00753_n1">1. In <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> Kennedy records at length conversations
      with Trowbridge in which the latter avers that "Emerson inspired the first poems
      of Whitman," and that Whitman had confided to him in 1860: "My ideas . . . were
      simmering and simmering, and Emerson brought them to a boil"
      (79–83).<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="n1044">2. Ralph Waldo Emerson
      (1803–1882) was an American poet and essayist who began the
      Transcendentalist movement with his 1836 essay <em>Nature</em>.
