      <br></br><br></br></span><span class="handshift">My Dear Mr. Whitman:—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">Since Jeff's<sup><a href="#n4995" id="r1">1</a></sup> death I have been
      constantly thinking that there should be some proper obituary notice of him
      published in one of the engineering journals.
   </p>
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">At the time of the death of Moses Lane,<sup><a href="#loc.00443_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I found that the notices which I wrote brought forth
      others from his friends, and withal it was very satisfactory to his family and those
      to whom he was especially dear.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">In Jeff's case, there is no one of us that knows enough of
      his early life to write a proper notice, in fact, there is no one that can do this
      with justice to his memory among us, save possibly Worthen<sup><a href="#loc.00429_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>, or Joe Davis,<sup><a href="#n0185" id="r4">4</a></sup> and we cannot hope for anything from them.
      Therefore, the thought has occurred to me that if you would write a notice that
      would take up say not over half a column </span><span>Publisher
      says you may take a whole column, </span><span class="handshift">(as it is very
      difficult, you know, in one of these engineering journals, to get more than this),
      if you would do this, I would attend to having it published in one of the
      engineering journals, and I know that it would be a very great satisfaction to his
      friends in the profession.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">The death of Jeff has been a very great blow to me
      personally, as for a good many years I looked upon him as one of my warmest friends.
      Our association of the last four or five years has been constant, and very close,
      and I have learned to lean upon him
      in so many ways that I feel as though a prop were taken out of my life by his
      death
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">I am sorry to have to write you a machine letter now, but
      my crippled arm makes this a necessity.
   </p>
   
   <p></span><span class="handshift">If you agree with me, and are willing </span><span>and strong enough</span><span class="handshift"> to furnish me
      the manuscript, I would suggest your doing it at once, as I shall be away from home
      after a few days, and besides that, it should be published as soon as possible.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Horace G. H. Tarr
      (1844-?) had just been promoted from private to sergeant major of Company K. His
      regiment fought at Chancellorsville, Virginia, May 1-5, 1863, but he was not
      injured. Evidently Tarr became a lifelong friend of Jeff and Walt Whitman (see
      Jeff's letter to Walt dated ).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4995">1. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00443_n3">2. Moses Lane
      (1823–82) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917) took a degree in
      civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1856 and then helped
      build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He was a topographical engineer in
      Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned to Brooklyn. A lifelong friend
      of Jeff's, he became city engineer of Boston (1871–80) and completed his
      distinguished career as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph
      Company (1880–1908).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00429_n1">3. William Ezra Worthen
      (1819–1897) graduated from Harvard in 1838 and soon became a leading civil
      and hydraulic engineer. He designed and built many dams and mills in New
      England, some of which still operate. Originally from Massachusetts, he settled
      in New York in 1849 and served as sanitary engineer of the Metropolitan Board of
      Health of New York City, 1866–69. He became noted for designing and
      testing pumping engines, including some for James P. Kirkwood during the early
      stages of the new St. Louis Water Works, and developed a major reputation as a
      consultant. He published several books on engineering and served as president of
      the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1887.<a href="#r3">[back]
