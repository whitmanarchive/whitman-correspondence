      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was on the point of writing you when this minute 8.30 A. M. the postman just gave
      me your card. Yes, I am in the same place, the little house where we have lived
      almost 21 years &amp; paid rent enough to buy it twice over. How long I shall be here,
      or what I am to do in the future is all a problem. I am sorry to tell you that after
      all my careful economy &amp; saving, the various things into which William<sup><a href="#n2002" id="r10">10</a></sup> had put money are mostly worthless, <u>inventions</u>
      that are good for nothing but to swallow up good money. Then in these last years
      since this illness began in 1884 his expenses have been enormous, &amp; the bills of
      doctors, &amp;c. very heavy. He has also
      been most lavish &amp; generous to the poor &amp; needy, &amp; to the <u>causes</u> in which he believed, &amp; the result is almost nothing left for me.
      Mr. Kimball<sup><a href="#loc.03298_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> who knew more of all this probably than I,
      (I mean the bad investments) came to see me soon after William's death<sup><a href="#loc.02978_n1" id="r12">12</a></sup> to say that if things
      were as they used to be, he could make a place for me in the office &amp; take me right
      in there, but that under the Civil Service rules, even if I should pass a good
      examination, one must wait till there is a vacancy in the State to which one is
      accredited, &amp; that might be <u>five</u> years! But he said that
      he would try very hard to get me into the Census bureau which is soon to be
      organized! I hoped then that I should not need it, but the revelations from day to day seem to
      make the outlook worse &amp; worse financially, &amp; I have just sent him a note, &amp; shall
      tell him that if I can fill any position, shall be grateful for it.
   </p>
   
   <p>But first I must go away &amp; rest. I have had no manner of rest since William had the
      first attack a
      year ago last January, &amp; I am really broken, &amp; these late revelations have helped
      to
      make me ill; [
      <span class="unclear">tho'?</span>]
       I
      did make a solemn &amp; holy vow that I would <u>not</u> worry about
      what has been &amp; can't
      be helped. But I am, or have been ill, so ill as to alarm the neighbors, but not
      myself. Then, too, I am alone, since Harold Channing<sup><a href="#loc.02978_n2" id="r13">13</a></sup> went home, &amp; I find that is not good for
      me.
   </p>
   
   <p>I go to New England, &amp; then in the autumn, return here, whether to break up &amp;
      vacate forever this little house, I know not. Indeed the way now looks very dark,
      but I try to trust &amp; hope &amp; confide in the loving care that always guides us.
   </p>
   
   <p>I did so plead with William, always, to try with me to buy a little, little house, so that we might
      have a home; but it was not to be, &amp; so it must be right.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes, I have from day to day, rec'd. the papers, &amp; all the many reminders of your
      thought to me, thanks for <u>all</u>, &amp; the copy of "Passage to
      India," &amp; the account of birth-day celebration, &amp;c. From day to day I wanted to
      write, but have had such discouraging &amp; disheartening work to do, &amp; so much of it,
      &amp;
      so many the papers &amp; letters to go over, &amp; the work is only begun; for in the last four or five years
      William has not kept his affairs in the order that he used to, his illness has told
      upon him in many ways. But I have been trying my best to put into order; but must
      soon drop all &amp; go for a time, or I shall not be able to get away. When I go, will
      send you my address, so that if you are disposed you can still keep me in mind by
      papers &amp; whatever you please to send.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You are mistaken, dear
      Walt, in saying that I have not written you since dear William's death. The <u>first</u> letter that I wrote was to you, on the very day, May
      9<u>th</u> I have had several most <u>vivid</u> dreams of you. So distinct that all the next day I felt as if I had
      been with you; &amp; I wonder whether my "astral body" went to you, or yours came to me.
   </p>
   
   <p>A day or two before William passed away he awoke from a nap &amp; asked me "if Walt
      had gone?" I said
      you had not been here, but he repeated the question, &amp; then I said yes, you had
      gone.
   </p>
   
   <p>I can't, I can't possibly believe that he is gone, I find myself looking for
      him daily,—&amp; the only time I have seen him since he departed this life was the
      day that I was so ill; &amp; he then looked perfectly well &amp; young, &amp; as he he did in
      the <u>L</u> St. house. I hope you get a copy of his last
      literary work, "Mr. Donnelly's Reviewers," I asked to have one sent you. If you see
      any notice of it, shall be very glad if you will send me.
   </p>
   
   <p>If ever the people that owe money to William would pay me, I should not be so worried
      about my daily expenses, for one can't break up in a minute, &amp; if I can keep on by
      having some one with me to help share the
      expenses when I come back, till I can see <u>what</u> to do. It
      is like taking my life to have to give up a <u>home</u> with no
      prospect of ever having one again. It is the only <u>earthly</u>
      possession that I ever longed for.
   </p> 
   
   <p>So I said, I will keep you informed of my whereabouts.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.07674_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario | Canada. It is postmarked: Camden, (?) |
      Jul 7 | 5pm | 89; Philadelphia, PA | Jul | 7 | 6PM | [illegible];
      London | AM | JY 9 | 89 | Canada. Whitman misdated this letter consistently for three
      days. July 7
      fell on a Sunday, June 7 on a Friday. Mrs. O'Connor sent an eleven-page letter
      to Whitman on July 3, 1889 about which he expressed doubts to Traubel on July 6, 1889
      as to
      sending it to Bucke (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.91.html">Sunday, July 7, 1889</a>). But he did include O'Connor's letter as an enclosure along
      with this letter to Bucke. For additional confirmation of the date, see
      Traubel's account of the poet's activities from July 5 to 7 (<em>With Walt Whiman in Camden</em>, <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.89.html">Friday, July 5, 1889</a> 
      and <a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/5/med.00005.90.html">Saturday, July 6, 1889</a>).
      Whitman rightly foresaw that Bucke would seize upon the following section in Mrs.
      O'Connor's letter: "I have had several most <em>vivid</em> dreams
      of you, so distinct that all the next day I felt as if I had been with you;
      &amp; I wonder whether my 'astral body' went to you, or yours came to me. A day
      or two before William passed away he awoke from a nap &amp; asked me 'if Walt
      had gone?' I said you had not been here, but he repeated the question, &amp;
      then I said yes, you had gone." See also the letter from Whitman to Bucke of .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">2. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07674_n2">3. Whitman was likely referring to Bucke's letter
      of . This letter does not seem to be extant; only discussion about it survives.
      See see Artem Loyzynsky, ed., <em>The Letters of Dr. Richard Maurice Bucke to Walt Whitman</em> (Detroit:

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03027_n3">4. The notes and addresses that
      were delivered at Whitman's seventieth birthday celebration on May 31, 1889 in
      Camden, were collected and edited by Horace Traubel. The volume was titled <em>Camden's Compliment to Walt Whitman</em>, and it included a
      photo of Sidney Morse's 1887 clay bust of Whitman as the frontispiece. The book
      was published in 1889 by Philadelphia publisher David McKay.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07674_n3">5. George Ferguson was the printer who
      had set the type for Whitman's <em>November Boughs</em> (1888).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0862">6. Sidney H. Morse (1832–1903)
      was a self-taught sculptor as well as a Unitarian minister and, from 1866 to
      1872, editor of <em>The Radical</em>. He visited Whitman in Camden
      many times and made various busts of him. Whitman had commented on an earlier
      bust by Morse that it was "wretchedly bad." For more on this, see Ruth L. Bohan,
      <em>Looking into Walt Whitman: American Art,
         1850–1920</em> (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press,

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">7. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4319">8. Edward "Ned" Wilkins
      (1865–1936) was one of Whitman's nurses during his Camden years; he was
      sent to Camden from London, Ontario, by Dr. Richard M. Bucke, and he began
      caring for Whitman on November 5, 1888. He stayed for a year before returning to
      Canada to attend the Ontario Veterinary School. For more information, see Bert
      A. Thompson, "Edward Wilkins: Male Nurse to Walt Whitman," <em>Walt Whitman Review</em> 15 (September 1969), 194–195.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="n4983">9. David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
