   <p>Yours of March 29 rec'd<sup><a href="#nyp.00579_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> &amp; welcomed—I sent you a
      request for two or three printed slips of the Preface, when in type—also some
      of the "additional note"—Keep your eyes open sharp to any little technical or
      <em>sentence</em> alterations of the text of "Spec: Days in
      America" for your Ed'n—as the book was printed rather hurriedly here for the
      America area, without tho't of foreign reprint—If you have any frontispiece
      portrait, try to have a good one—else none at all w'd be best—the one in
      y'r little L of G is bad—I go on to New York (if I can get there) to deliver
      my "Death of Lincoln" lecture<sup><a href="#duk.00864_n1" id="r3">3</a></sup>—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Ernest Percival Rhys
      (1859–1946) was a British author and editor; he founded the Everyman's
      Library series of inexpensive reprintings of popular works. He included a volume
      of Whitman's poems in the Canterbury Poets series and two volumes of Whitman's
      prose in the Camelot series for Walter Scott publishers. For more information
      about Rhys, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_103.html">Rhys, Ernest Percival (1859–1946)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New

   <p id="duk.00864_n1">3. The lecture was a
      tremendous success, and Whitman was so showered with adulation that he observed
      in the Commonplace Book: "If I had staid longer, I sh'd have been killed with
      kindness &amp; compliments" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). The
      arrangements for the lecture were made by John H. Johnston; see his letter to
      Walt Whitman on . The poet stayed at
      the Westminster Hotel in a suite once occupied by Dickens, where on April 13 he
      was visited by such old friends as Johnston, Burroughs, Stedman, and Richard
      Watson Gilder. At the Madison-Square Theatre on the next day he was escorted on
      stage by William Duckett and gave his lecture before an audience that included
      James Russell Lowell, John Hay, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and Andrew Carnegie.
      After his speech he received "two or more hundred friends" at Westminster Hotel,
      appearing "little fatigued," according to the New York <em>Evening
         Sun</em>. On the following day he sat for C. O. Cox, the photographer, and
      Dora Wheeler, "portrait painter" (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs — Comrades</em> (1931), 264–265). A lengthy notice
      appeared in the <em>New York Times</em> on April 15. For this
      lecture Walt Whitman received $600, $250 from the sale of tickets and $350 from
      Carnegie.<a href="#r3">[back]
