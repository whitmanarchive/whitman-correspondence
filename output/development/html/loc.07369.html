   <p>S.<sup><a href="#loc.07369_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> was away when your picture came, attending his sick brother, Charles—who has since
      died—an event that has sadden'd<sup><a href="#loc.07369_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> me much. Charlie was younger than S., and a most attractive young
      fellow. He work'd at my father's, and had done so for two years. He was
      about the best specimen of a young country farm-hand I ever knew. You
      would have loved him. He was like one of your poems. With his great
      strength, his blond hair, his cheerfulness and contentment, his universal
      good will, and his silent manly ways, he was a youth hard to match. He 
      was murder'd by an old doctor. He had typhoid fever, and the old fool
      bled him twice. He lived to wear out the fever, but had not strength to
      rally. He was out of his head nearly all the time. In the morning, as he
      died in the afternoon, S. was standing over him, when Charlie put up his
      arms around S.'s neck, and pull'd his face down and kiss'd him. S. said
      he knew then the end was near. (S. stuck to him day and night to the last.)
      When I was home in August, Charlie was cradling on the hill, and it was a
      picture to see him walk through the grain. All work seem'd play to him.
      He had no vices, any more than Nature has, and was belov'd by all who
      knew him.

   <p>I have written thus to you about him, for such young men belong to
      you; he was of your kind. I wish you could have known him. He had the
      sweetness of a child, and the strength and courage and readiness of a
      young Viking. His mother and father are poor; they have a rough, hard
      farm. His mother works in the field with her husband when the work
      presses. She has had twelve children.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07369_n1">1. Smith Caswell was one of
      Burroughs's hired hands (Clara Barrus, <em>Whitman and
         Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston, New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1931],
      178). After Burroughs informed Whitman of the death of Caswell's brother,
      Charles, the poet copied verbatim Burroughs's sketch of the young man in "Three
      Young Men's Deaths," printed in <em>Cope's Tobacco Plant</em> and
      later in <em>Specimen Days</em> (157–158). Whitman sent the
      article to John Fraser, the editor of <em>Cope's Tobacco
         Plant</em>, on , through Josiah
      Child (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers
      of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See
