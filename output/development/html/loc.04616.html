      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend, Walt Whitman!
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Though a stranger to you, in your Book you have been my friend, and so I salute you.
      I want to inform you that a literary club of young men to which I belong, and which
      is called the Melancholy Club, are to celebrate your Birthday this week on the third
      of June, Saturday, (at their rooms, 52 Lexington Ave., New York) with poems and
      addresses and music and supper. I cannot tell you, sir, how greatly we consider you.
      But we have adopted this method of expressing our love for you and appreciation of
      your noble music. We would be overjoyed to have you with us, could you come; and
      that <u>you</u> would <u>also</u> be
      delighted, the sweet and beautiful Philosophy of your Book already discovers. We were
      to
      celebrate the occasion on the 31<u>st</u> of this month, but college harness held some of us too tightly in
      check, and therefore we had to postpone it till the first convenient evening; which
      caused us some disappointment as we had been looking forward for many months to the
      Day of your Birth itself on which to meet in song and festivity to your honor,
   </p>
   
   <p>Thou "
      measurless
      
       sweet vocalist of Ages!"
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I am urgently requested to invite you to attend; and as a Birthday token I send you
      some verses in your own heroic measure (or a poor attempt to imitate it) by one of
      the members of the Melancholy Club, my friend Leonard Wheeler. Take it as earnest
      of the respect in
      which we hold youâ€”we, a number of young men, students of Theology, Music,
      Poetry, Painting, &amp; Medicine, and devoted to you, your Champions &amp;
      Lovers!
   </p>

      I have the honor to be
