   <p>I have only just heard<sup><a href="#ucb.00060_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> that a foreign P O order for
      £1-1s (one pound, one shilling) was sent to me from Mrs J Alexander, the Palace,
      Derry, Ireland, in June 1878—which P O order has never reached me. See if
      there is any 
      acc't
      
       of it in your office—if not, send this on to New York, to see if any 
      acc't
      
       there—with request that, if necessary they would further inquire of
      the London (or Derry) offices—

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="ucb.00060_n1">1. According to his
      Commonplace Book, Whitman learned from Thomas W. H. Rolleston that Mrs.
      Alexander had not received a copy of <em>Two Rivulets</em>, which
      she had ordered in 1878 (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). See the letter
      from Rolleston to Whitman of . The
      poet sent the book on August 9, 1879, and so informed Rolleston on the same day,
      to whom he wrote again on August 14: "sent p. o. letters." Whitman received a
      postal order for $10 from Mrs. Alexander about November 1, 1879, while he was in
      St. Louis (<em>St. Louis Diary</em>).<a href="#r1">[back]
