   <p>I send you Edward Carpenter's letter to Herby, as requested—Also H's to me (as he
      may not have written to you)<sup><a href="#upa.00180_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Your E.C.'s letter rec'd this morning—thanks—Nothing very new with me—I continue well—have had the best summer
      for several years—My brother &amp; sister are well—he, <u>plus</u>—she only measurably. I think Mrs Stafford is only middling—(I havn't been at White Horse now for a fortnight)<sup><a href="#upa.00180_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—My nieces are still with us (though just now at Atlantic City for a few days)—they
      return to their school latter part of Sept—Your letter of Aug 12 was rec'd &amp; has been read by all of us<sup><a href="#upa.00180_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—have you rec'd papers?
   </p>
