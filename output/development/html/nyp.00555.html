   <p>The box (Oranges) has just come, (the letter came two hours ago) &amp; I hasten to
      acknowledge them, without opening the box, but I thank you heartily &amp; know I
      shall enjoy the fruit. I am here not much different from usual late years, but
      older, more broken &amp; paralyzed—I have a little old cottage of my own in
      which I live, &amp; have a good young woman, a widow, for cook &amp;
      housekeeper<sup><a href="#n6113" id="r2">2</a></sup>—I am fearfully disabled, yet retain good spirits—have just
      been out for a drive—Often think of Helen (dear Helen)<sup><a href="#loc.02893_n5" id="r3">3</a></sup> and you &amp; all—Is this letter address'd
      right?—I should occasionally send H. a letter or paper, but am doubtful ab't
      the address—

      1838–1908) was Whitman's housekeeper. For more, see Carol J. Singley,

   <p id="loc.02893_n5">3. Helen Price was the daughter
      of Abby H. Price (1814–1878) and Edmund Price. During the late 1850s and
      throughout the 1860s, Abby and Helen were friends with Whitman and his mother,
      and the Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of
      Whitman were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's 1883 biography of Whitman. For
