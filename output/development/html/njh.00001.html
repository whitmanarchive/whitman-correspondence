      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In answer to your note of 15th, I would inform you that a small edition has just been
      published of 
      "Leaves of Grass" complete, (including "Drum Taps," &amp;c)—price $3. I think Hudson Taylor's
      bookstore, 
      on Penn'a. Av, has them—If not, I can supply you with a copy, by your calling on me
      at this Office.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      Yours, respectfully,
      <br></br>Walt Whitman

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="njh.00001_n1">1. This letter's envelope
      bears the address, "Llewellyn Avery, Jr. | Washington, | D.C." It is postmarked:
      "Washington | Feb | 20 | D.C."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="njh.00001_n3">2. On the verso of the
      envelope, presumably in Avery's hand, appear several notations: "Received
      February 20th, 1867. | Walt Whitman was forty years | old during the 83d
      Anniversary | of American Independence.…'I am Walt Whitman liberal and
      lusty | as nature.'"<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
