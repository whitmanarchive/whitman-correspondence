   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0817">1. Susan M. Stafford was the mother of
      Harry Stafford, who, in 1876, became a close friend of Whitman while working at
      the printing office of the <em>Camden New Republic</em>. Whitman
      regularly visited the Staffords at their family farm near Kirkwood, New Jersey.
      Whitman enjoyed the atmosphere and tranquility that the farm provided and would
      often stay for weeks at a time (see David G. Miller, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html">Stafford, George and Susan M.</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 685).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0852b">2. George Stafford was Harry
      Stafford's father.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0910">3. Mont is Montgomery Stafford
      (1862â€“1926?), one of Harry's brothers.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="man.00051_n1">4. In this paragraph Susan
      refers to the other Stafford children: Edwin, Van Doran, Ruth, George, and
      Deborah, who was married to Joseph Browning.<a href="#r4">[back]
