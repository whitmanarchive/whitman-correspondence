   <p id="prc.00065_n1">2. Sydney Howard Vines
      (1849–1934) was among Edward Carpenter's circle of Whitman admirers in
      England. On November 13, Carpenter sent Whitman—in a letter now
      lost—Vines's request for books. On the same date he sent this letter to
      Vines, Whitman sent a letter to Carpenter, noting, "have to-day mailed Mr Vines'
      books" (<em>The Collected Writings of Walt Whitman: The
         Correspondence</em>, ed. Edwin Haviland Miller (New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77), 3:103). At that time, Vines was Fellow and
      Lecturer in Botany at Christ's College, Cambridge, and later was named
      Sherardian Professor of Botany at Oxford. Whitman received word from Carpenter
      on December 19 that "I hear from Vines that your books have arrived" (Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (Boston: Small,
      Maynard, 1906), 1:189). Vines's copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      inscribed by Whitman, "Sidney H. Vines from the author," was among the books
      offered for sale in the Spring 2001 catalog of Bertram Rota, Ltd., an
      antiquarian bookseller in London.<a href="#r2">[back]
