      <br></br><br></br>My dear friend
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Real glad to hear from you once more, as by yours of 18th—The death of Mrs:
      Gilchrist is indeed a gloomy fact—she had cancer, &amp; suffered much the last
      three months of her life with asthma—for a long time "every breath was a
      struggle," Herbert expresses it—the actual cause of death was dilatation of
      the heart. Seems to me mortality never enclosed a more beautiful spirit—
   </p>
   
   <p>The trouble ab't my eyesight passed over, &amp; I use both eyes now same as
      before—I am living here, rather monotonously, but get along—as I write,
      feel ab't the same as of late years—only the walking power seems quite gone
      from me, I can hardly get from one room to another—sometimes quite force
      myself to get out a few yards, but difficult &amp; risky—
   </p>
   
   <p>O'Connor seems to be holding on at Washington—I think he is middling well,
      except the leg power—his "gelatine legs" he calls them—will pass over I
      rather think—
   </p>
   
   <p>I drove down yesterday (Sunday) to my friends the Staffords, 10 miles from here,
      &amp; staid three hours, had dinner &amp;c—I go <em>there</em> every Sunday—So I
      get stirr'd up some, but not half enough—three reasons, my natural
      sluggishness &amp; the paralysis of late years, the weather, &amp; my old, stiff,
      slow horse, with a lurking propensity to stumble down—
   </p>
   
   <p>The "free will offering" of the English, through Rossetti, has amounted in the past
      year to over $400—I am living on it—I get a miserable return of
      royalties from McKay, my Philad. publisher—<em>not $50 for both
         books L of G. and S D for the past year</em><sup><a href="#nyp.00543_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>John, I like <em>both the names</em> in your note—I cannot
      choose—if I lean at all it is in favor of "Spring Relish"<sup><a href="#nyp.00543_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—either would be first rate—Did you get W S
      Kennedy's pamphlet "the Poet as a Craftsman"<sup><a href="#nyp.00543_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—I
      hear from Dr Bucke quite often—he was the past season somewhat broken in
      physical stamina &amp; health—but is better—he gives up for the present
      his European tour, but is coming here soon for a week—As I close, my bird is
      singing like a house afire, &amp; the sun is shining out—I wish you were here
      to spend the day with me—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
