   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."
   </p>

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n12">1. This letter dates to
      March 16, 1870. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter "16" in her own
      hand, and Edwin Haviland Miller assigned the date December? 16, 1868 (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:366). Miller probably dated this letter
      according to Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's December 1868 visit to
      Brooklyn. But Miller's date is too early: Mattie also arrived in Brooklyn
      during February 1870 and departed on March 14, 1870, a Monday. This letter
      is associated with Mattie's early 1870 visit to Brooklyn.<br><br>
      Mattie departed from her month-long visit to Brooklyn on March 14, 1870, and
      her daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa had not accompanied her on the
      trip (see Louisa's  letter to
      Walt Whitman). The date of Mattie's departure from Brooklyn and her expected
      arrival in St. Louis matches Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman's March 18,
      1870 letter to Louisa (Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, ed., <em>Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson
         Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent State University Press, 1984], 143). Jeff
      returned to St. Louis on February 26, 1870 while Mattie remained in Brooklyn
      (see Mattie's February 27, 1870 letter to Walt in Randall H. Waldron, ed.,
      <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em>
      [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 68). During her trip, Mattie
      planned also to visit Washington, D.C., and to stay with William D. and
      Ellen M. O'Connor, but those plans were scuttled (see Mattie's March 1, 1870
      letter to Walt Whitman [Waldron, 69–70]). This letter from Louisa
      indicates that Mattie will not travel to Washington, and Louisa asked Walt
      to thank the O'Connors on Mattie's behalf. Joseph Phineas Davis has also
      visited Louisa in Brooklyn, and his visit is consistent with his recent
      departure from St. Louis to become an engineer in Lowell, Massachusetts (see
      Mattie's February 27, 1870 letter to Walt [Waldron, 68–69]). Finally,
      the damaging storm that Louisa noted at the close of the letter was reported
      in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em> just days after Mattie's
      departure for St. Louis (see Louisa's  letter to Walt). This letter is consistent with Mattie's
      March 14, 1870 departure from Brooklyn after an extended visit, with her
      cancellation of a planned trip to Washington and a stay with the O'Connors,
      with Davis's visit to Brooklyn on his way to Lowell, and with the date of a
      severe storm, so it dates March 16, 1870.<br><br>
      Pieces of this letter are held in two repositories. The portion of the letter
      in the Yale Collection of American Letter is incomplete and lacks a closing.
      The remainder of the letter was discovered in January 2012 by Kenneth M.
      Price and Brett Barney, in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection (Library of
      Congress). The portion in the Feinberg Collection lacks a date and
      salutation but has a closing. Louisa's references to Mattie's expected
      arrival in St. Louis and to a "terrible storm" confirm that the newly
      discovered Feinberg leaf is the remainder of Louisa's March 16, 1870 letter
      in the Yale Collection.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n13">2. Walt had not visited
      Brooklyn, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had permitted her daughter-in-law Martha
      Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman's letters to Walt to substitute for her own: "Mother
      says she will not write this week" (see Mattie's March 1, 1870 to Walt Whitman,
      <em>Mattie</em>, 69). Louisa presumably allowed Mattie
      Whitman's promised letter the following week to also serve (Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 70).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n11">4. Helen Price was the
      daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby Price and her family, especially her
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother, Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman. Abby H. Price (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform
      movements. Price's husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and
      the couple had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in
      1852, at 2 years of age). In 1860, the Price family began to save Walt's
      letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman were included in Richard Maurice
      Bucke's biography, <em>Walt Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David
      McKay, 1883), and she printed for the first time some of Whitman's letters to
      her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5 [1908], 163–169).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n2">5. Mrs. Black was a neighbor to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. After Louisa moved to Camden, New Jersey, Mrs. Black
      complained that Helen Price no longer visited her: "tell Helen she might come to
      Brooklyn and see me now that Mrs. Whitman has moved away I am just as good as
      she is" (see Helen's November 24, 1872 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      [Trent Collection, Duke University]). Louisa also mentioned Mrs. Black in her
      , , and  letters to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n3">6. Moses Lane
      (1823–1882), who served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works
      from 1862 to 1869, was one of the most generous contributors to Walt
      Whitman's hospital work (see Lane's  letter to Whitman), and he promoted both Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's career as an engineer and George Washington Whitman's work as a
      pipe inspector. Lane married Marinda Ingalls (1829–) in 1852, and they
      had four children (<em>United States Census, 1880</em>,
      Milwaukee, Wisconsin; "Moses Lane," <em>Proceedings of the
         American Society of Civil Engineers</em> [February 1882], 58).<br><br>
      James P. Kirkwood (1807?–1877), who also contributed to Walt Whitman's
      hospital work, designed the Brooklyn Water Works, consulted on the design of
      the St. Louis Water Works, and served as the second president of the
      American Society of Civil Engineers. Sarah E. Richards (1817–) was the
      maiden name of his second wife ("Obituary. James P. Kirkwood," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, April 24, 1877, 4; <em>United States Census, 1870</em>, New York, Brooklyn Ward
      3, Kings).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n14">7. Anna Van Wycke (or "Van
      Wyck") had boarded with the Whitmans in Brooklyn, and the Van Wycke family farm
      was near Colyer farm, which had belonged to Jesse Whitman, Walt Whitman's
      paternal grandfather. See Bertha H. Funnel, <em>Whitman on Long
         Island</em> (Port Washington, New York: Kennikat Press, 1971), 78.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n16">8. During her spring 1870 trip
      east, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman intended to travel from Brooklyn to
      Washington, D.C., to visit Walt Whitman and her friends Julius Mason, his wife
      Mary, and probably Julius's sister Irene. Mattie planned to stay with William D.
      and Ellen M. O'Connor while in Washington. See her March 1, 1870 letter to Walt
      Whitman (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977],
      69–70; 69, n. 4).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00466_n5">9. For a time Walt Whitman
      lived with William Douglas and Ellen M. O'Connor, who, with Charles Eldridge and
      later John Burroughs, were to be his close associates during the early
      Washington years. William D. O'Connor (1832–1889) was the author of the
      pro-Whitman pamphlet "The Good Gray Poet" in 1866 (a digital version of the
      pamphlet is available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). Ellen "Nelly" O'Connor,
      William's wife, had a close personal relationship with Whitman. The
      correspondence between Walt Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the
      poet's correspondence with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the
      O'Connors, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>."<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n15">10. At the time of this visit
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, Joseph Phineas Davis (1837–1917) was on his
      way to Lowell, Massachusetts, where he would serve as an engineer. Davis, a
      lifelong friend of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, shared the Pacific Street
      house with Louisa, her son Edward, and Jeff Whitman's family before Jeff
      departed for St. Louis. Davis also served briefly as the chief engineer for
      Prospect Park in Brooklyn (see Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman). After he departed St. Louis, Davis
      stopped at least three times to visit Louisa when he traveled through Brooklyn
      (also see Louisa's  and  letters to Walt).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="hyb.00002_n5">11. For Joseph Phineas Davis's
      work with Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman in St. Louis, see Jeff's , , and  letters to Walt
      Whitman. Davis took a degree in civil engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic
      Institute in 1856 and then helped build the Brooklyn Water Works until 1861. He
      was a topographical engineer in Peru from 1861 to 1865, after which he returned
      to Brooklyn. Davis eventually became city engineer of Boston (1871–1880)
      and later served as chief engineer of the American Telephone and Telegraph
      Company (1880–1908).<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.04728_n3">12. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. Jeff in
      1867 became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and would become a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. Jeff departed St. Louis with
      his wife, Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, in mid-February 1870 but spent time
      in Pittsburgh before rejoining his wife in Brooklyn. Jeff departed Brooklyn to
      return to St. Louis on February 26 (see Mattie's February 27, 1870 letter to
      Walt Whitman (Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of
         Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977],
      68). For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">13. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on

      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
