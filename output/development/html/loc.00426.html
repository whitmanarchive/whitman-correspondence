      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother received a letter from you yesterday<sup><a href="#loc.00426_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;I got one the day before.<sup><a href="#loc.00426_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> Mother did not let me see her letter<sup><a href="#loc.00426_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> but Mat says that she understands that you say that you think about coming home.
      I hope dear Walt, that you <em>will</em> come and that soon &nbsp;I think if you should come just now you might be able to do Andrew
      considerable good &nbsp;He is in a very bad way and I really fear, under the present circumstances
      that he will not last long. Dear Walt I wish that I could do something more for Andrew,
      but I have to work all the time, almost day and night and another thing I think he would be guided more by your advice than any one elses &nbsp;That damed infernal robber the doctor<sup><a href="#loc.00426_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> that he has been with (Andrew has paid him $95 and been getting worse all the time)
      told Andrew yesterday that he must not come there again till he brought him $45 more.
      Only think of it. The infernal son of a bitch. I would like to hang him for a thousand
      years, ten times a second. I dont care anything about it for the good that I think that he could do Andrew but that
      he Andrew thinks that perhaps if he could pay him $45 he could do something for him.
      The very fact that the scoundrel wants the money in advance is enough &nbsp;Dear Walt do come home if only for a short time &nbsp;And unless you come quite soon you
      certainly will never see Andrew alive.<sup><a href="#loc.00426_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Will you write me at once if you can come.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother Mat and Sis are all suffering from bad colds, Mother particularly I think is
      failing rapidly. I do so wish that I could see you and have a good talk abt family affairs &nbsp;I am in an awful hurry or would write more. To day I have to go through
      the whole line of conduit

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="loc.00426_n1">1. See Whitman's letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman from .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>

         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00426_n3">3. On September 10 (?),
      1863, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman had instructed Walt Whitman to "write on a piece
      of paper loose from the letter if you say anything you dont want all to read"
      (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Books, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library). It is hard to say why Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      might have kept Walt Whitman's letter of , away from Jeff since it was by no means of a sensitive or
      private nature.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00426_n4">4. See Thomas Jefferson
      Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman from . Jeff seems to be referring to the "Italian Dr" here. But on
      October 30 (?), 1863, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman noted that Andrew "is doctoring
      with dr Brody." Perhaps Jeff's complaints led to the change.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00426_n5">5. Writing to his mother
      on , Walt Whitman commented: "If I
      thought it would be any benefit to Andrew I should certainly leave everything
      else &amp; come back to Brooklyn." Nonetheless, despite Jeff's repeated pleas
      and his assurances that Andrew would listen to Walt Whitman's advice above that
      of all others, the poet refused to return home. As Edwin Haviland Miller
      comments, Walt Whitman had "little excuse for delay" (<em>Walt
         Whitman: The Corespondence</em>, [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 1:165, n. 90). Perhaps the poet was loathe to return to an
      upsetting and hopeless situation at a time when he was "very happy [in the
      hospitals]. I never was so beloved." So many men were wounded at this time that
      he had "to bustle round, to keep from crying." The poet may also have been
      trying to avoid further strain to his already overcharged emotions. See <em>Correspondence</em>, 1:164, 166).<a href="#r5">[back]
