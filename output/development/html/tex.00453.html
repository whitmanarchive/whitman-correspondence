   </p>
   
   <p>Herbert Gilchrist has sent me £2 from you, as your annual donation, wh' I rec'd
      yesterday, &amp; hereby rec't &amp; thank you for. I am still living here, not much
      different from formerly—in good spirits, &amp; getting along, hearty &amp; fat
      and red, but clumsy &amp; debilitated more &amp; more.
   </p>
   
   <p>I think of collecting together my prose &amp; verse of the last five years, &amp;
      printing a little Vol: under the title of "November Boughs"—also of bringing
      out a complete budget of <em>all</em> my writing in one book.<sup><a href="#tex.00453_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I remember you with much love—
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Edward Dowden (1843–1913), professor of
      English literature at the University of Dublin, was one of the first to
      critically appreciate Whitman's poetry, particularly abroad, and was primarily
      responsible for Whitman's popularity among students in Dublin. In July 1871,
      Dowden penned a glowing review of Whitman's work in the <em>Westminster Review</em> entitled "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/reviews/india/tei/anc.00073.html">The Poetry of Democracy: Walt Whitman</a>," in which Dowden described
      Whitman as "a man unlike any of his predecessors . . . Bard of America, and Bard
      of democracy." In 1888 Whitman observed to Traubel: "Dowden is a book-man: but
      he is also and more particularly a man-man: I guess that is where we connect"
      (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/1/med.00001.74.html">Sunday, June 10, 1888</a>).
