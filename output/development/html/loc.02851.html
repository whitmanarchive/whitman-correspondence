      This letter's envelope bears the address, "R Spence Watson | 101 Pilgrim
      Street | Newcastle-on-Tyne | England." It is postmarked: "Camden | Sep | 9 |
      N.J."<br><br>
      Watson was apparently one of William Michael Rossetti's friends and among the
      early English admirers of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman
      had sent a set of books on . On
      September 29, 1884, Watson requested an inscribed copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
