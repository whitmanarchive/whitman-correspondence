      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I am Officer of the guard again to night and as I have nothing particular to do for
      the next two hours I may as well have a little talk with you. Well Mamy how are you
      to night, and how is Mat and Sis and all the rest of the folkses &nbsp;does your wrists trouble you any now a days, and are you as fat and handsome as
      ever, &nbsp;I suppose you still live in the same house, &nbsp;does Mrs Brown live with you yet,<sup><a href="#duk.00318_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> or aint you boss of the institution, this year. I am mighty anxious to know how you have
      things aranged. I am perfectly well and hearty, the weather here is fine and the men
      generaly are pretty healthy. The news from New Orleans<sup><a href="#duk.00318_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and in fact from all parts of the Union keeps us all in good spirits so that we get along first rate.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have been reinforced within the last week by a Regt of Cavelry and a battery of
      light artillary with eight rifled guns, so we are about ready to advance, if there is any advanceing to be done in this part of the world &nbsp;I would not be surprised if we were to move
      somewhere inland, on the railroad runing from Richmond through this State and leading down South somewhere I dont know where. But it seems to me if we could stop the retreat of the varmints and let
      McClelland<sup><a href="#duk.00318_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> have a chance to get his name up it would bee about the thing.
   </p>
   
   <p>We have not been paid off yet Mother but we expect to be in a very few days, &nbsp;just
      as soon as I get my money I will send you 50 or 60$ by Adams Express, &nbsp;the paymaster
      is here and he is looking for the money to arive every day. The 1st Leiut of our Co whose name is Francis,<sup><a href="#duk.00318_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> has a wife in Burlington Vt &nbsp;he wrote to her to call on Han &nbsp;So I expect to hear
      from her—Soon.
   </p>
   
   <p>It is now three or four weeks since I have heard from home, but we expect a mail in
      a day or two and then I hope to hear from you all.
   </p>
   
   <p>What is the reason Walt or Jeff does not write to me once in a while. You dont know how glad I am to hear from you and I feel quite out of Sorts, to have a mail
      come and bring nothing for me.
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00318_n1">1. The family of John Brown,
      a tailor, had been sharing the Portland Avenue house with the Whitmans since
      1860. See Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letter to Walt Whitman, March 30, 1860
      (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript, and
      Special Collections Library).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00318_n2">2. The land-sea expedition
      under the command of Commodore David G. Farragut captured the Confederate port
      of New Orleans on April 29, 1862.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00318_n3">3. General George Brinton
      McClellan (1826–1885) was General-in-Chief of the Army of the United
      States from November 1861, until July 1862, when he was replaced by General
      Henry W. Halleck. In 1864, when McClellan ran for the presidency, the Democratic
      party split between war Democrats and peace Democrats. To satisfy the war
      Democrats McClellan was nominated; to satisfy the peace Democrats C. L.
      Vallandigham and his followers were allowed to draft the platform. Thomas
      Jefferson Whitman evidently considered the entire Democratic party as "the peace
      party" as evidenced from the letter to his brother Walt dated .<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00318_n4">4. Henry W. Francis of
      Buffalo, New York, was promoted to the rank of captain to replace Hazard when
      the latter left military service. After living with George Whitman's regiment
      for a time after the battle of Fredericksburg, Walt Whitman made the following
      comment in a letter to his mother from : "Capt. Francis is not a man I could like much—I had very
      little to say to him."<a href="#r4">[back]
