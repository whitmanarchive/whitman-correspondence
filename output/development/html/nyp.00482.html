   <p id="nyp.00482_n2">2. On March 19 O'Connor
      offered two suggestions: the lines referring to Longinus in Pope's <em>Essay on Criticism</em> and three lines from <em>Hamlet</em> (Charles E. Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress,
      Washington D.C.). Either Bucke or Whitman decided not to follow his proposals,
      and inserted a quotation from "a letter to R. M. B., by W. F., Mobile, Ala.,
      March, 1883" (Richard Maurice Bucke, <em>Walt Whitman</em>
      [Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883], 72). Bucke wrote to O'Connor about the motto
      on March 30 (The Library of Congress, Washington D.C.).<a href="#r2">[back]
