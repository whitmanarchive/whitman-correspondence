   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00401_n1">1. Linton (1812–1897), British-born
      wood engraver, came to the U.S. in 1866 and settled near New Haven, Conn. He
      illustrated the works of Whittier, Longfellow, Bryant, and others, wrote the <em>History of Wood-Engraving in America</em> (1882), and edited
      <em>Poetry of America, 1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in
      which appeared eight of Walt Whitman's poems as well as his picture. According
      to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Walt
      Whitman in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in
      his  letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."<a href="#r1">[back]
