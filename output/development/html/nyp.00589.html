   <p id="nyp.00589_n1">1. This note apparently was
      sent about August 1 to Brainerd, and the item appeared in the Saturday edition
      of the <em>Daily News</em>, as indicated in Whitman's letter to
      Brainerd on . The Whitman Society
      was widely discussed at this time by Whitman's friends and critics. There is no
      extant file of the <em>Daily News</em> for this period.<a href="#r1">[back]
