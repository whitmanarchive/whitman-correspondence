      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Your welcome letter was duly received for which accept many thanks.<sup><a href="#yal.00378_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   
   <p>I write now in great haste to ask your assistance in behalf of Our Ruffle Manufacture
      and if you succeed in doing what we ask, or in getting it done I am authorised to
      offer you a 1000 dollar check as soon as it is done! think of <u>that</u>. It is only a simple act of justice that we ask either
   </p>
   
   <p>The committee have just [
      <span class="unclear">revised?</span>]
       the law concerning the "internal Revenue tax and "articles of
      clothing made by sewing from materials already having 
      payed
      
       tax are exempted we thought our goods came under that head and rejoiced
      greatly but the Assesor says <u>not</u> so  Our Manufacture bring <u>trimmings</u> to clothing and not clothing. Now 
      altho
      
       we got the article patented and have tried in vain to defend the patent
      and put down infringers by law. The article is made in secret by unprincipled
      parties who do not pay any revenue tax at all, as they make no returns to the
      Internal Revenue Office, but are Jews working in a very underhanded way. Still we
      have to compete in the market with their manufacture. Our company always making fair
      returns each month and paying so large a proportion of the profit as tax, that in
      order to sell as low as those who evade the law, has left us very little scarcely
      enough to encourage 
      the manufacture at all. The tax on my part the last year was quite as much as I
      receivedâ€”
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Well, what we want is to have them the ruffles <u>exempted</u> by
      the <u>Committee</u> before Congress adjourns either as parts of
      articles of clothing made by sewing or as a special article. They have exempted
      "step ladders" and several other things which I forget now.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You might ask it as "<u>parts</u> of articles of clothing such as
      shirt bosoms, <u>ruffles</u>, &amp;c. made by <u>sewing</u> and of materials already paying tax" (shirt bosoms
      are in the law mentioned as exempted, and I think they will easily put in <u>ruffles</u> if you can hurry up and get at  them soon enough.
   </p>
   
   <p>You see Harland<sup><a href="#n0288" id="r2">2</a></sup> right away and tell him about it and find out
      who the Committee are. and I guess if you have time enough you can get it done and
      I
      shall have the fun of sending you the check! In haste to get it in to-night
   </p>

      Yours ever
      <br></br>A H Price
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The $1000 is to pay you for a <u>big</u> effort and the
      trustees told me this morning they would gladly pay it you
