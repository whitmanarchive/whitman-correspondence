   <p>Bee's card rec'd this morning—glad &amp; thankful to hear all is going well with you—have abstained from
      coming over, for fear of being in the way—but hope I may come soon—Mannahatta and
      Jessie went off in the 11:45 train from Phil: to-day<sup><a href="#upa.00167_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—in good spirits, &amp; excellent well, and have had a jolly good visit both to you &amp;
      yours &amp; over here—My sister is well—She went over with the girls to the depot—saw
      them off safely, &amp; returned to dinner—No further news rec'd by me from Herby—I am well as usual—doing nothing particular—
