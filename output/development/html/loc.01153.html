      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> A happy New Year to you, &amp; many returns of the same. I was right glad to get your
      letter &amp; to know your eyes were so much better. I feel certain that if you eat
      little or no meat you will be greatly the gainer. It will not do to take
      in sail in ones activities &amp;c, unless he takes in sail in his food also.
   </p>
   
   <p> We are all pretty well here  this winter so far. I have just sent off the copy for my new 
      vol: think I shall stick to "Signs &amp; Seasons" for the title, as this
      covers all the articles.<sup><a href="#loc.01153_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      sent me his essay on the <u>Poet as Craftsman</u>.<sup><a href="#loc.02599_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> I liked it
      pretty well: what he has to say about you is excellent. He wanted my opinion about
      the argument of the essay, so I told him that I never felt like quarreling with a
      real poet about his form: let him take the form he can use best; any form is good
      if
      it holds good poetry  &amp; any form is bad that holds bad poetry. I would not have
      Tennyson,<sup><a href="#n0625" id="r5">5</a></sup> or Longfellow<sup><a href="#n0367" id="r6">6</a></sup> or Burns<sup><a href="#loc.01153_n2" id="r7">7</a></sup> use other forms than they do. If a man excells in prose
      he is pretty sure to use prose. Coleridge<sup><a href="#n3049" id="r8">8</a></sup> is greater in prose than in poetry. Poe is
      greater in poetry than in prose. Carlyle<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r9">9</a></sup> tried the poetic form
      &amp; gave it up. 
   </p>  
   
   <p> I hope you will keep well &amp; that I will see you again before long. How much I
      wish you were here to eat a New Years dinner  with us. I wrote to Herbert
      Gilchrist the other day.<sup><a href="#n0262" id="r10">10</a></sup> These must be dark days for he &amp;
      Grace.<sup><a href="#n0890" id="r11">11</a></sup> To me a black shadow seems to have settled on all
      England since I read of the death of Mrs Gilchrist.<sup><a href="#loc.02182_n1" id="r12">12</a></sup> I
      wish you would send me by mail or by Express those books of Emerson,<sup><a href="#loc.01149_n3" id="r13">13</a></sup> the essays &amp; the miscellanies. I want to use them. I
      am going to re-read Emerson, &amp; see how he strikes me now.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="n3039">3. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.

   <p id="loc.02599_n1">4. Kennedy had been writing a
      defense of Whitman and sent a manuscript of the essay to Whitman on . Growing impatient, he reminded
      the poet to answer his letter on . Over
      two months later, on , Whitman responded,
      finding the manuscript "all right" as well as "lofty, subtle &amp; true" but
      suggesting Kennedy add "a criticism on <u>Tennyson and Walt
         Whitman</u> (or if you prefer on <u>Victor Hugo, T and

      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r5">[back]

      (1807–1882) was both a highly popular and highly respected American poet.
      His <em>The Song of Hiawatha</em>, published the same year as <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, enjoyed sales never reached by Whitman's
      poetry. When Whitman met Longfellow in June 1876, he was unimpressed: "His
      manners were stately, conventional—all right but all careful . . . he did
      not branch out or attract" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman
         in Camden</em> [Boston: Small, Maynard, 1906], 1:129–130).<a href="#r6">[back]

      Having read Whitman's first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>,
      Emerson wrote a letter to Whitman, famously pronouncing him to be "at the
