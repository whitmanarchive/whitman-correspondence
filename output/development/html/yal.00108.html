      <br></br><br></br>My dear Mr Osgood
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of yesterday 
      rec'd, which settles the engagement. I shall forward the copy
      soon. The name will be <u>Walt Whitman's Poems</u>—with the
      sub-title <u>Leaves</u> of <u>Grass</u> in its place or places inside. I
      suggest a 400 page book—in size, thickness, general appearance &amp;c: closely
      like Houghton &amp; Mifflin's 1880 edition of <u>Owen Meredith's
         Poems</u>, only better paper &amp; print, &amp; at least one size larger
      type—I think in solid bourgeois (or long primer)—ought to be new
      type—page the same size as the Owen Meredith (see outline in blue lines on the
      picture I send) with the same rather narrow margin, which I prefer to wide—in
      the make up every thing the reverse of free spacing out or 
      
      free
      leading—of course not crowding too close either, but with an eye to compacting
      the matter (for there is quite a good deal to go in the 400 pages)—plain green
      muslin binding—binding costing say 15 or 16 
      cts.—no gilt edges—a
      handsome, stately, <u>plain book</u>—
   </p>
   
   <p>I shall get a new copyright out—Shall probably write to you in London about the
      English sale<sup><a href="#yal.00108_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Can I get a British copyright by
      going to Canada? If so I will go—How would the enclosed picture do for a
      frontispiece? I like it—It is made by Gutekunst 712 Arch St
      Philadelphia—I think he would furnish them at three to four dollars a
      thousand.<sup><a href="#yal.00108_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></p>

   <p>Who of your house shall I specially see &amp; deal with if I should take a notion
      to come on to Boston in person with the copy—or after the type setting
      commences?

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="yal.00108_n1">1. Osgood advised Whitman on
       to write to him in care of Trübner
      &amp; Co., London.<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="yal.00108_n2">2. Benjamin H. Ticknor, who
      replied to this letter on , liked the
      "photo-type": "should be quite inclined to use it, and perhaps also the first,
      steel, portrait." After noting his letter to Osgood on June 4 in his Commonplace
      Book, Whitman added: "(mistake about price of lith[ograph] corrected next day)"
