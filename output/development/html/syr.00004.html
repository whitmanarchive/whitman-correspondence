      <br></br>Dear Sir!
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I will postpone no longer to thank you for your kind letter of 7 Dec. It was in my hands two
      days before the beginning of the new year. Your "leaves of grass"
      Clausen has already sent me; but the other
      papers—especially your "democratic vistas"—shall be
      very welcome. I wonder, that they have not arrived yet, and hope, that they  have not miscarried on
      the way. This unexpected delay makes me very sorry; my mind is full of your poems,
      but naturally I won't 
      beginn
      
       to write before having in my hands as complete materials as 
      possibly
      
      .
   </p>
   
   <p>Hans Christian Andersen would perhaps not make
      you very great joy, if you did know him personally.
      Björnson would be your man, he is a dear friend of
      mine and coeditor of the periodical. At present he is living in Christiania.
   </p>
   
   <p>The enclosed portrait is no bad photography, but a photographical portrait is never
      truly a good one.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>The Swede Peter Carl Rudolph
      Schmidt (1836–1899) was the editor of the idealist <em>For
         Idé og Virkelighed</em> ("For Idea and Reality") and had translated
      Whitman's <em>Democratic Vistas</em> into Danish in 1871 (see the
      letter from Schmidt to Whitman of ).
