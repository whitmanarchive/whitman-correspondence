      <br></br>Albany, <br xmlns="" class="opener">June, 8th, 1867
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Friend Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of May 30th was received some time since<sup><a href="#loc.01921_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> and I take great pleasure in writing
      to you again, and in giving you some of the particular in regard to my health, limb
      situation, &amp;c
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My health at present is very good—better than at any time since I left the army for
      I
      had considerable 
      sickness
      
       during the first two years after coming home
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My limb has never troubled me of any account  have worn my artificial nearly all the
      time since the winter of –'64.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>About one year an half ago I went to work in the "State Lunatic asylum" as an
      attendant, worked there some eight months and was taken sick, the physician told me
      it was caused by being confined 
      to
      
       much, and so I left. I then went to Rhode Island where I had some
      relatives, last fall I came to albany and when the Legislature convened, obtained
      a
      position as watchman—it lasted about three months.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This summer they are having a State – Convention I had a promise  of doorkeeper but they
      managed it so that I was unable to obtain it. It seems that the President of the
      Convention instead of appointing the doorkeepers by himself gave the 
      delagates
      
       of each Judicial Dist a choice of their 
      apointment
      
       (these being about one appointment to each dist) the 
      Secratary
      
       of the Convention appointed a man from Oswego Co. as clerk (which being in
      my dist) threw me out of my position as doortender. I do not know what I shall go
      to
      doing now, perhaps something may turn up after a while.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was glad to learn that Lewis had so good a situation  I was 
      verry
      
       neglectful in my 
      correspondance
      
       with him and I am ashamed of not writing to him also to Joe Harrisbut I
      have one good excuse and that is, as you will 
      verry
      
       readily see, a poor writer. During the time that I was in the Hospital in
      Washington I formed some acquaintances 
      than
      
       I can never forget indeed I have thought of them often Mrs Wright, &amp;
      Hanly. 
      Misses
      
       Martin &amp; Lowell and some others were the best women I ever saw and I
      wish them all the 
      hapiness
      
       and prosperity 
      imagineable
      
      , there are other ladies to be sure that I feel under many obligations  too, but to these 
      especialy
      
      . To you, Joe Harris, &amp; Dr. 
      Bliss
      
       I feel deep gratitude more than I can ever repay.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>The information that you sent me about some of the comrades was surprising Tobias
      the 
      dresser
      
       that was killed. I have often thought of him and wondered if he came out
      of the war. I saw Tom Sawyer in N.Y. three years ago.

       I think has done
      remarkably well may he still flourish and perhaps we may yet hear of him as an
      ornament to the State in which he now so nobly [illegible]
       I will now draw this
      to a close, and may I hear from you again soon. I am a poor writer and cannot
      furnish anything 
      verry
      
       interesting to you to read only so far as my own self is concerned
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Remember me to all of my acquaintances and if any of them have any ill will on
      account of my not writing let them lay it to my inabilities instead of my
      inclination
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Waiting to hear from you again dear friend allow me to subscribe myself</p>
