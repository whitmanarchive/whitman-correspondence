   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <p id="loc.00482_n2">2. For Davis, see . Henry Flad (1824-98) graduated from the University of Munich in
      1846. Sentenced to death after serving as captain of engineers in the
      Parliamentary Army during the revolution of 1848, he fled to New York City in
      1849 and embarked on a distinguished career in civil engineering. He worked on
      several railroad projects, including one which brought him to Missouri in 1854.
      He joined the Union army in 1861 and eventually became colonel of the First
      Regiment of Engineers, Missouri Volunteers. In 1865 he became the chief
      assistant engineer under James P. Kirkwood on the St. Louis Water Works and
      served continuously on the Board of Water Commissioners from 1867 to 1875.
      During this period he was also the assistant engineer on the Eads Bridge, a
      pioneering achievement in bridge construction. He was a cofounder of the
      Engineers' Club of St. Louis and served as its president from 1868 to 1880. He
      was president of the St. Louis Board of Public Improvements from 1877 to 1890
      and was elected president of the American Society of Civil Engineers in
      1886.<a href="#r2">[back]
