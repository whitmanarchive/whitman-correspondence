   <p id="nyp.00501_n1">1. This letter is endorsed:
      "Answ'd Dec 2/83." It is addressed: Wm D O'Connor | Life Saving Service |
      Washington D C. It is postmarked: Camden | Sep | 25 | 4 PM | N.J.; Washington,
      Recd. | Sep | 26 | 5 AM | 1883 | 2.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00501_n2">2. On  O'Connor spoke of "a vague wandering
      notion of sending it to <em>The Critic</em>," but "I felt rather
      deterred by the remembrance of [Joseph L.] Gilder's unfriendly sport at me when
      I was fighting that contemptible clergyman, Chadwick, and was so clearly in the
      right" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>
      [1906–1996], 9 vols., 4:395).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="nyp.00501_n3">3. Eldridge, who had lost
      his governmental position because of "an uncircumcized dog," and was about to
      establish a law practice in Boston, wrote to Whitman on : "I am still in the prime of life, have health, some
      means and many friends, and if under these circumstances I did not cheerfully
      accept the situation I should be unworthy ever to have read Leaves of Grass,
      with its philosophy of hope and the morning." O'Connor, as indicated in his
      letter to Whitman of , wanted Eldridge
      to re-enter the publishing business, "so that we might start a magazine, and
      make it pleasant for the bats and owls and literary carrion generally, but he
      appears to have abandoned the idea" (Traubel, 4:191–192).<a href="#r3">[back]
