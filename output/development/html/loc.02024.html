   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles W. Eldridge (1837–1903) was one half
      of the Boston-based abolitionist publishing firm Thayer and Eldridge, who issued
      the 1860 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. In December 1862, on
      his way to find his injured brother George in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Walt
      Whitman stopped in Washington and encountered Eldridge, who had become a clerk
      in the office of the army paymaster, Major Lyman Hapgood. Eldridge eventually
      obtained a desk for Whitman in Hapgood's office. For more on Whitman's
      relationship with Thayer and Eldridge, see David Breckenridge Donlon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_57.html">Thayer, William Wilde (1829–1896) and Charles W. Eldridge

   <p id="n2002">2. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

   <p id="med.00796_n2">3. Whitman first delivered this
      lecture in New York in 1879 and would deliver it at least eight other times over
      the succeeding years, delivering it for the last time on April 15, 1890. He had
      published a version of the lecture as "Death of Abraham Lincoln" in <em>Specimen Days</em> (1882-83). For more on the lecture, see
      Larry D. Griffin, "'Death of Abraham Lincoln,'" <em>Walt Whitman:
         An Encyclopedia</em>, J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings, ed., (New York:

   <p id="n4105">4. Moncure Conway (1832–1907)
      was a Unitarian minister who lived in England from the 1860s until 1885, where
      he served as a supporter of Whitman and wrote frequently about the poet.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02024_n2">5. In his Commonplace Book
      (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.) on February 25 Whitman had observed: "Am
      collecting 'Elias Hicks' these days." Elias Hicks (1748–1830) was a Quaker
      from Long Island whose controversial teachings led to a split in the Religious
      Society of Friends in 1827, a division that was not resolved until 1955. Hicks
      had been a friend of Whitman's father and grandfather, and Whitman himself was a
      supporter and proponent of Hicks's teachings, writing about him in <em>Specimen Days</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf084v1">Reminiscence of Elias Hicks</a>") and <em>November
         Boughs</em> (see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/other/CompleteProse.html#leaf231r1">Elias Hicks, Notes (such as they are)</a>"). For more on Hicks and his
      influence on Whitman, see David S. Reynolds, <em>Walt Whitman's
         America</em> (New York: Knopf, 1995), 37–39.<a href="#r5">[back]
