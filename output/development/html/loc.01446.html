   <p>I must first render you thanks for the box of books, as they have at
      last reached me in good condition—The delay in their arrival is unaccountable. But
      they are welcome, and will all be read in due time, and with sincere gratitude to
      the donor.
      Both your letters also reached me, and were cordially welcomed. I should have acknowledged
      them at date, only that for many weeks I have been disabled from writing &amp; from any
      clerical work, by reason of a wound in the right hand, which is now better. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>There is nothing new or noteworthy in my own affairs. I still remain in the Attorney
      General's office here—still enjoying good health. I keep fashioning &amp; shaping my
      books at my leisure, &amp; hope to put them in type the current year. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>You speak of my prose preface to first "Leaves of Grass." I am unable to send it you,
      having not a copy left. It was written hastily while the first edition was being printed
      in
      1855—I do not consider it of permanent value.<sup><a href="#loc.01446_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> I shall send
      you, (probably in the mail that follows this—certainly very soon,) a piece written
      some while since by me on "Democracy"<sup><a href="#loc.01446_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>—in which Mr.
      Carlyle's "shooting Niagara"<sup><a href="#n0139" id="r4">4</a></sup> is alluded to. I shall also send an
      article by an English lady,<sup><a href="#loc.01446_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> put in print here, that may interest
      you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am writing this at my desk in the Treasury building here, an immense pile, in which
      our
      office occupies rooms. From my large open window I have an extensive view of sky,
      Potomac
      river, hills &amp; fields of Virginia, many, many miles. We are having a spell of that
      oppressive heat which so much falls upon us here.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Dixon, an uneducated corkcutter
      of Sunderland, England, was one of Walt Whitman's early English admirers. In
      1856 he had bought copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> from a
      book peddler; one of these copies was later sent by William B. Scott to
      William Michael Rossetti. Dixon vigorously supported cultural projects and
      was in effect the ideal laborer of Ruskin, who printed many of his letters
      to the corkcutter in <em>Time and Tide</em> (1867). See <em>Autobiographical Notes of the Life of William Bell
         Scott</em>, ed. W. Minto (1892), 2:32–33, 267–269; Harold
      Blodgett, <em>Walt Whitman in England</em> (1934),
      15–17; <em>The Works of John Ruskin</em>, ed. E. T. Cook
      and Alexander Wedderburn (1905), 17:lxxviii–lxxix.<br><br>
      On the basis of the lengthy correspondence of this impassioned man now
      preserved in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt
      Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., it seems
      clear that Dixon must have written to Walt Whitman in 1869 or earlier and
      asked him to inquire about the whereabouts of his sister. (Walt Whitman's
      reply is apparently lost.) They exchanged photographs at this time, Dixon's
      being dated October, 1869. In Dixon's first extant letter, dated , he wrote: "I love nearly all
      the Men thou lovest, and all the Books and thoughts that seem congenial to
      thee, long hath been so to me. I gaze at the Sea while I eat my food and
      think of thee. . . . and often while I gaze thereon I think of thee, and how
      thou loves that Sea, and how to thee it hath been more then to me." On
      January 9, 1870, Dixon informed Rossetti that he was enclosing a copy of
      Walt Whitman's portrait, and that Walt Whitman had sent "a very nice letter
      of sympathy for <em>Mother's death</em>, and of friendship to
      me" (<em>Rossetti Papers</em>, 508). In June, Dixon sent books
      which included Mazzini, Carlyle, and various works on oriental religion. He
      asked for Walt Whitman's opinion of them on . The fervor of the corkcutter was evident in his letter of
      : "Ruskin is also working
      hard too to help on a nobler life, and one not much unlike the one you also
      long to see. so many souls laboring for one end must someday effect the
      accomplishment of the 'Golden Days' so long sung, so long toiled for, prayed
      for—and fought for!!" When Walt Whitman wrote again to Dixon in 1876
      (the letters are not known), the latter resumed the correspondence with his
      customary intensity. "I see thee now while I write this," he wrote on . "I look into thine eyes. I
      grasp thy hand. Thou grasps it hard, thou looks upon me with a smile. I hear
      thee say: 'All is peace now, young man, the Storm is indeed past. I live
      once again in the Souls and memories of these Hero's and all is Well!'"
      Later, on , he reported that in
      addition to selling and circulating many copies he had placed Walt Whitman's
      poem in the town libraries at Shields, Manchester, New Castle, Warrington,
      Liverpool, and Plymouth. "So you see," he concluded modestly, "the little
      band's been a Working one."
