   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Born and raised in Illinios,
      Otto O. Hemenway (ca. 1874–1946) worked as a bookkeeper and, later, as an
      insurance salesman. He married Minnie Lee Johnston in 1903. If Federal Census
      records are correct in their documentation of his birth year, Hemenway would
      have fifteen or sixteen years old at the time of his correspondence with
      Whitman.
