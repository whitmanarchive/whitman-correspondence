   <p>Still here in my big chair in the sick room yet—a coolish wave to-day, but
      pleasant enough—John Burroughs<sup><a href="#n0129" id="r2">2</a></sup> has been to see me, the good hearty
      affectionate nature-scented fellow, very welcome<sup><a href="#loc.07530_n2" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he left yesterday en route to visit Johnson<sup><a href="#uva.00388_n1" id="r4">4</a></sup> (Century staff) at Sea Girt, on
      the N J sea coast—J B lodged at Tom Harned's,<sup><a href="#loc.03745_n1" id="r5">5</a></sup> &amp; T H and Horace<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r6">6</a></sup> liked him
      muchly—J B is not so hardy &amp; brown &amp; stout as formerly—that bad
      fiend insomnia haunts him as of old—he thinks himself it affects his literary
      power, (style, even matter)—Horace told him my half-suspicion that his
      association with the superciliousness &amp; sort o' vitriolic veneering of the New
      York literati had eat into him, but he denied &amp; pooh-pooh'd it—attributed
      it to his bad health, insomnia &amp;c—said he knew himself he could not (or 
      did not) write with the vim of his better days—(probably makes more acc't of
      that by far, than really <em>is</em>)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I expect to get a specimen copy of <em>November Boughs</em><sup><a href="#n3999" id="r7">7</a></sup> from the
      binder this evening—Shall not feel out of the woods &amp; all safe, until I
      see the October <em>Century</em>, with my Army Hospital piece
      printed—accepted &amp; paid for by them two years ago—as I consider
      myself obligated not to print from it until it has been <em>first</em>
      published by them—(But I have heard they give it—intend to—in the
      Oct. number)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p><em>Afternoon</em>—Horace comes with spec[imen] of <em>Nov: B</em> bound for sample—it is satisfactory—looks
      plain, larger than expected—I give an order or two changing the lettering on
      cover, &amp;c.—the picture printing gives satisfaction—In fact <em>all will do</em>—("Only think" said the Irish girl "what
      ye'd said if it was ever so worser")—I have been expecting Alma Johnston<sup><a href="#n3330" id="r8">8</a></sup> of N
      Y to-day (or yesterday)—but no sign—a dear &amp; prized
      friend—"good roots" for the meter<sup><a href="#loc.07530_n3" id="r9">9</a></sup> (slang from N Y
      vagabonds, for favorable prophecy)—It gets cooler &amp; I have donn'd my big
      blue wool overgown—as I end with love &amp; thanks to you—

      <br></br>Walt Whitman

<div class="editorial_notes">
   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n0129">2. The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and

   <p id="loc.07530_n2">3. Burroughs was in Camden
      on September 19 and 20. In his journal he wrote of their farewell: "He presses
      my hand long and tenderly; we kiss and part, probably for the last time. I think
      he has in his own mind given up the fight, and awaits the end" (Clara Barrus,
      <em>Whitman and Burroughs—Comrades</em> [Boston:
      Houghton Mifflin Co., 1931], 283).<a href="#r3">[back]

   <p id="uva.00388_n1">4. Robert Underwood Johnson
      (1853–1937) was on the staff of <em>The Century
         Magazine</em> from 1873 to 1913, and was U. S. ambassador to Italy in 1920
      and 1921. Whitman included in this letter a news release based on an interview
      printed in the St. Louis <em>Post-Dispatch</em> on October 17, in
      which he criticized Bryant, Whittier, and Longfellow (reprinted in <em>American Literature</em>, 14 [1942–1943],
      144–147). See also Johnson, <em>Remembered Yesterdays</em>

   <p id="loc.03745_n1">5. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel, was Horace Traubel's
      brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt

   <p id="n4267">6. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
