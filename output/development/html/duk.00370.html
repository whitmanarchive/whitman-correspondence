   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>"Little Mitch," or Reuben
      Farwell, served with the Michigan Cavalry during the War and met Walt Whitman in
      Armory Square Hospital early in 1864, and upon his release from the hospital he
      corresponded with Whitman. After Farwell received his discharge on August 24,
      1864, he returned to his home in Plymouth, Michigan. Evidently the
      correspondence was renewed when Whitman sent a post card on February 5, 1875. On
      March 5, 1875, Farwell, who owned a farm in Michigan, wrote: "Walt my dear old
      Friend how I would like to grasp your hand and give you a kiss as I did in the
      days of yore. what a satisfaction it would be to me." In Farwell's last letter,
      on August 16, 1875, he said that he was planning to leave shortly for
      California. Eleven letters from Farwell are in the Trent Collection. He is
      mentioned in <em>Memoranda During the War</em> (see <em>The Complete Writings of Walt Whitman</em>, 10 vols. [New
      York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1902], 4:134). When Bucke wrote to Farwell after Walt
      Whitman's death, apparently only this one note, written "on the back of a
      circular," was extant (Miller). For Farwell's other correspondence with Whitman
