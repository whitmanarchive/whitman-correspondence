   </p>
   
   <p>I see by this morning's paper, that Starr &amp; Co. has taken the contract for the 36
      in pipes for Washington &amp; I am thinking of trying to get the inspecting of them. Genl
      Greene<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I understand is appointed Chief Eng'r of the Dept. of Public Wks, but Major Elliot<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has the immediate charge of Water Dept.
   </p>
   
   <p>Do you know Maj. Elliot and if so can you find out from him if he has any particular
      person that he wants to inspect the pipes. I would like to find out if it would be
      of any use for me to go to Washington &amp; see him in regard to the matter. I do not
      care to go unless I have a good show for the work. I could refer him to Mr Kirkwood,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Genl Greene, Mr Lane,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Col Adams,<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Mr. Tracy, Davis &amp;C.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> Walt cant you stop here on your return to Washington, &nbsp;if you could only bring Mother
      we would be delighted.<sup><a href="#loc.00487_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>George Washington Whitman (1829â€“1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
