   <p>Davis's report of me and my talk, in re the Swinburne article,<sup><a href="#med.00821_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> is very cute and is satisfactory to me every way.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Talcott Williams
      (1849–1928) was associated with the New York <em>Sun</em>
      and <em>World</em> as well as the Springfield <em>Republican</em> before he became the editor of the Philadelphia <em>Press</em> in 1879. His newspaper vigorously defended Whitman
      in news articles and editorials after the Boston censorship of 1882. For more
      information about Williams, see Philip W. Leon, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_108.html">Williams, Talcott (1849–1928)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman:

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00821_n1">1. In the August issue of <em>The Fortnightly Review</em>, Swinburne repudiated his earlier
      praise of Whitman. Apparently, a reporter named Davis from the Philadelphia <em>Press</em>, of which Talcott Williams was the editor,
      questioned Whitman on his reactions. The interview appeared in the <em>Press</em> on August 3, 1887.<a href="#r1">[back]
