   </p>
   
   
   <p>This will show you that "the lamp still holds out to burn"—though I have had a bad
      two months past—I have had another paralytic stroke,<sup><a href="#duk.00670_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> but it passed over, without any thing serious, (it is probable 
      I have had several slight strokes)—but I am feeling, as I write, about the same as
      is now usual for me—still entertain expectations—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>If practicable I shall bring out a Vol. the coming summer—I hope to pay you <em>the visit</em> yet—Did you get the paper 
      I sent with a report of Emerson's late lecture on <em>Eloquence</em>—of course interesting, from him, but nothing very stunning, 
      it seemed to me—I see that Conway is coming to America next autumn certain, to see
      things, travel, lecture, &amp;c—<sup><a href="#duk.00670_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>John, [I] send you the last letter from a quondam correspondent &amp; unseen rebel friend
      of mine, 
      away down in Alabama<sup><a href="#duk.00670_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—He seems to me a good affectionate fellow, a sort of uncut gem—I have had five or
      six letters from him, 
      all primitive but good—What are <em>you</em> about?—&amp; how are you &amp; 'Sula getting along?

   <p><em>Correspondents:</em><br>The naturalist John Burroughs (1837–1921) met
      Whitman on the streets of Washington, D.C., in 1864. After returning to Brooklyn
      in 1864, Whitman commenced what was to become a lifelong correspondence with
      Burroughs. Burroughs was magnetically drawn to Whitman. However, the
      correspondence between the two men is, as Burroughs acknowledged, curiously
      "matter-of-fact." Burroughs would write several books involving or devoted to
      Whitman's work: <em>Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person</em>
      (1867), <em>Birds and Poets</em> (1877), <em>Whitman, A Study</em> (1896), and <em>Accepting the
         Universe</em> (1924). For more on Whitman's relationship with Burroughs, see
      Carmine Sarracino, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_15.html">Burroughs, John [1837–1921] and Ursula [1836–1917]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<br>Ursula North Burroughs
      (1836–1917) was John Burroughs's wife. Ursula and John were married on
      September 12, 1857. The couple maintained a small farm overlooking the Hudson
      River in West Park, Ulster County. They adopted a son, Julian, at two months of
      age. It was only later revealed that John himself was the biological father of
      Julian.<br></p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00670_n1">1. That this letter was
      written in 1875 is confirmed by the succeeding notes. In addition, as indicated
      in Whitman's  letter to William
      J. Linton, Whitman had begun plans for a new edition of his works.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00670_n2">2. Whitman experienced a
      stroke on February 16, 1875, as mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Peter Doyle.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00670_n3">3. Moncure D. Conway arrived
      in America in September 1875; in his  letter to William J. Linton, Whitman mentioned that Conway had
      "just arr'd here from England."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00670_n4">4. At the time Whitman wrote
      to Burroughs he had received, as he said, six letters from the colorful and
      eccentric John Newton Johnson, a self-styled philosopher from rural Alabama.
      There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C., but unfortunately there are no replies extant, although
      Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years. When
      Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," a former Rebel soldier with
      an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the war he had been "a
      youthful 'patriarch.'" He informed Whitman that during the past summer he had
      bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and after a momentary suspicion
      that the bookseller should be "<em>hung for swindling</em>," he
      discovered the mystery of Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon
      'cavorting' round and asserting that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not
      be replaced. (Now Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn
      over to him all profits or to lend him money. In the letter he enclosed a gold
      dollar: "So much grand poetry nearly kills me with the pain of delight."
      Characteristically, he concluded his letter with an unexpected question: "Walt!
      Are you Orthodox or Universalist? I am Materialist of late." On , after describing Guntersville,
      Alabama, he commented: "<em>Orthodoxy</em> flourishes with the
      usual <em>lack</em> of <em>flowers</em> or <em>fruit</em>." His amusingly detailed description of his face on
      , Whitman marked in red
      crayon. Thus Johnson became a self-designated philosophical jester to amuse
      Whitman. See also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet
         and Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.<a href="#r4">[back]
