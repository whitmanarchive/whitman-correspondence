      <br></br><br></br>My dear Linton,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just been spending an hour looking over "The Future"—and the "Ireland"<sup><a href="#med.00697_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> you sent me—&amp; stopping at certain pieces here &amp;
      there, &amp; reading them quite carefully, &amp; dwelling upon them. They touch me
      deeply—indeed more than anything of the kind had previously done—the
      undertone of anguish and despair—the Laocoön struggles, (apparently useless)
      under the tightening grip[p]ing folds of the serpent—the cries &amp; complaints
      &amp; remonstrances &amp; calls for help—somehow, in your verses, brought the
      fearful condition of the laboring millions not only of Ireland, Italy, Poland
      &amp;c—but all Europe—more vividly than ever yet, before me.
   </p>
   
   <p>And it is well for me to get such reminding's—</p>
   
   <p>But my own vein is full of hope, promise, faith, certainty—I see how an
      American—I for instance—cannot perhaps realize the peoples desperate
      condition over the major part of the world—
   </p>
   
   <p>—This point you have to-day brought up sharply before me.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William J. Linton
      (1812–1897), a British-born wood engraver, came to the United States in
      1866 and settled near New Haven, Connecticut. He illustrated the works of John
      Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, and
      others, wrote the "indispensable" <em>History of Wood-Engraving in
         America</em> (1882), and edited <em>Poetry of America,
         1776–1876</em> (London, 1878), in which appeared eight of Whitman's
      poems as well as a frontispiece engraving of the poet. According to his <em>Threescore and Ten Years, 1820 to
         1890—Recollections</em> (1894), 216–217, Linton met with Whitman
      in Washington and later visited him in Camden (which Whitman reported in his
      , letter to Peter Doyle): "I
      liked the man much, a fine-natured, good-hearted, big fellow, . . . a true poet
      who could not write poetry, much of 
      wilfulness
      
       accounting for his neglect of form."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00697_n1">1. In addition to being a
      major wood engraver and editor, William J. Linton was a poet of minor
      reputation. He appears to have taken advantage of his new contact with Whitman
      by sending him a pair of poems for his perusal.<a href="#r1">[back]
