      sunny day, moist enough (plenty of rain lately here) &amp; pretty warm—was out
      last evening (sunset) two hours down to the Delaware shore, high water—sky
      &amp; river never look'd finer—was out also at one p m to my friend
      Harned's<sup><a href="#n4146" id="r2">2</a></sup> to drink a bottle of champagne—(lunch, or
      dinner, but I ate nothing)—So you see I am getting around sort o' in my wheel

      accepted &amp; paid, some rejected—&amp; so we are
      well in for another summer—I want to get out somewhere (sea side or mountains)
      but it is a fearful job for me to be moved from my <u>habitat</u> &amp; ways here—As
      things are I depend on inherited impetus mainly, &amp; humor everything or rather
      let it go.

      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0119">1. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4146">2. Thomas Biggs Harned
      (1851–1921) was one of Whitman's literary executors. Harned was a lawyer
      in Philadelphia and, having married Augusta Anna Traubel (1856–1914), was
      Horace Traubel's brother-in-law. For more on him, see Dena Mattausch, "<a href="https://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_191.html">Harned, Thomas Biggs (1851–1921)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998). For more on his relationship with Whitman, see
      Thomas Biggs Harned, <em>Memoirs of Thomas B. Harned, Walt
         Whitman's Friend and Literary Executor</em>, ed. Peter Van Egmond (Hartford:
      Transcendental Books, 1972).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03012_n1">3. Horace Traubel and Ed
      Wilkins, Whitman's nurse, went to Philadelphia to purchase a wheeled chair for
      the poet that would allow him to be "pull'd or push'd" outdoors. See Whitman's
      letter to William Sloane Kennedy of .<a href="#r3">[back]

      years on a book about Whitman and often sent Whitman sections to review; not
      until after Whitman's death, in 1896, was his <em>Reminiscences of
