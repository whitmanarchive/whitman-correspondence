   <p>I will be at the house in time to go with you &amp; see the Capitol lighted. 
      About the dinner, (thank you for your kind invitation<sup><a href="#nyp.00259_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup>,) I fear I shall not be with you to-day.

      Walt Whitman to dinner earlier that day, but Whitman wrote in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor

      go to-day."<a href="#r2">[back]
