      <br></br>ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,<br xmlns="" class="opener">
      Washington
      <br xmlns="" class="opener">Aug. 15, 1865
      
      <br></br><br></br>Dear Anson, 
      
   </p>
   
   <p>As there is a sort of lull and quiet for a short time in my work, I will improve the
      opportunity to write to you, dear friend. In this office, I am in the part where the
      Pardons are attended to. There is a perfect stream of Rebels coming in here all the
      time to get pardoned. All the Southerners that are worth more than $20,000 in property,
      have to get special pardons, &amp; all who have been officers of the rank of Brig. Gen'l,
      or upwards, the same. Many old men come in here, and middle-aged &amp; young ones too. I often talk with them. There are some real characters
      among them—(&amp; you know I have a fancy for any thing a little out of the usual style)—
   </p>  
   
   <p>Quite a good many women come up to Washington, &amp; come to this office, about their
      pardons—some old, some young—all are drest in deep black. Then there are bushels of
      applications arriving every week by mail. When they are recommended by the Provisional
      Governors, or some well known Union person, they get their papers—Many have got their
      papers—but nearly all are waiting for the President's signature—I should think 3 or 4 000. He is n't in any hurry to sign them.
   </p>
   
   <p>I was down at Armory Square Sunday. Dr. Smith said he had rec'd a letter from you,
      &amp; was just going to answer it.<sup><a href="#pri.00023_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> I went awhile in Ward I, among the rebels—they are in a wretched condition, &amp; nobody
      goes among them. I shall go in &amp; see Hiram in a day or so. I am in good health, &amp;
      generally have easy times—As half the force of clerks here are off on leave, I some
      days have a pressure—&amp; that is the case lately. But I shall be careful to make it
      up. We have pleasanter weather here the last ten days—quite cool mornings &amp; nights.
   </p>
   
   <p>My dear friend; I am sorry you could not have been with me for a day or two before
      you left Washington, as it may be we shall not meet again. But you must not forget
      me, for I shall not you. Write to me from time to time, Anson, &amp; I will you too. The
      picture you shall have—As I am writing this at the office, otherwise I would enclose
      one of the card photographs in it—they are up at my room—I will send one in my next.<sup><a href="#pri.00023_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> Write how your leg is—Give my best remembrances to Wood—he is a good man &amp; I hope
      he will prosper through life—When you write, direct to me, Attorney General's Office,
      Washington, D. C.
   </p>
   
   <p>Blue coats here are getting quite scarce. Your letter of 9th came safe, &amp; was welcome.
      I envy you the pure fresh country air &amp; healthy influences, &amp; I doubt not, fine scenery
      &amp; quiet. When you write tell me
   </p>

   <p>Anson, as I neglected to send this yesterday, I have brought down a couple of little
      pictures &amp; enclose them, after all. But you shall have a larger &amp; better one, dear
      son,—I will have it prepared &amp; fix some way to send it to you. They have commenced
      breaking up Armory Square. The picture in shirt sleeves was taken in 1854—You would
      not know it was me now, but it was taken from life &amp; was first-rate then. Anson, when
      you write tell me all particulars of yourself, folk's place &amp; about Wood, &amp;c.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Apparently Anson Ryder, Jr.,
      left Armory Square Hospital and, accompanied by another injured soldier named
      Wood (probably Calvin B. Wood; see Edward F. Grier, ed., <em>Notes
         and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–84], 6:673), returned to his family at Cedar Lake, New York.
