   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00511_n1">1. This letter dates to
      December 26, 1867. The date, "26," and day of the week, "Thursday," are in
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's hand. Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the month and
      year December 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller agreed with Bucke's date (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 1:379). December 26 fell on Thursday in 1867,
      and the letter's concern, that Martha Mitchell Whitman was dissatisfied with her
      new place and decided to return to St. Louis with Thomas Jefferson Whitman, is
      consistent with late 1867.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">2. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00511_n4">4. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman (1833–1890) had pipe for the St. Louis Water Works made at the
      R. D. Wood Foundry in Florence, New Jersey. George Washington Whitman in
      late 1867 served as a pipe inspector both for Moses Lane's Brooklyn Water
      Works in Camden, New Jersey and for Jeff Whitman's pipe at the R. D. Wood
      Foundry (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman).<br><br>
      Jeff was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr., and
      Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he worked as a surveyor
      and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working for the Brooklyn
      Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil War. In 1867
      Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00511_n5">5. Walt Whitman's letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman on his expected visit is not extant. He arrived in
      Brooklyn on January 1 or 2, 1868 (see his  letter to Francis P. Church and William C. Church), and he
      returned to Washington on or near January 18 (see Walt's  letter to Edmund Routledge).<a href="#r5">[back]
