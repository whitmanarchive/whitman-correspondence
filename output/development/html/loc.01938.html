      <br></br><br></br>Mr. Walt Whitman.
      <br></br>Dear Sir:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your books were returned yesterday. The Web. Dict. and the Auth. Dict. will send as
      soon as we can. Nothing new to add to what has been already said as to acc't. Inclosed
      find statement.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The "Liberals" do not, as a rule, take the slightest trouble to sustain a publishing
      house of this character as they ought. I am left to fight the battle [
      <span class="unclear">single?</span>]
      -handed. There is sufficient coming to me to tide me over till times change, but they
      do not pay. Many in the trade let their acc'ts stand for years &amp; they in the meantime
      doing a good business.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Am in receipt of orders for
      
      
      
      your books occasionally from the trade; but as the orders are not accompanied by cash,
      we cannot send to you for the books. What shall we do with such orders? Have in our
      hands now an order which was sent to J. S. Redfield, by A. L. Bancroft, San Francisco
      (Publishers and Booksellers.) as follows:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>1 Leaves of Grass, to be sent to F.S. Richards, Ogden, Utah, by mail.</p>
   
   
   <p>3 Leaves of Grass, to be sent to Appleton &amp; Co., to pack for A.L.B. &amp; Co., All of
      above to be billed to A.L.B. &amp; Co.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Probably the 3 Leaves should now be sent to A.L.B. &amp; Co., in care of [
      <span class="unclear">Irwin?</span>]
      , Blakeman, Taylor &amp; Co. Booksellers, Grant St. N.Y. to pack for A.L.B. &amp; Co.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please instruct us what to do with any orders we receive for your books.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles P. Somerby was one of the book dealers whom
      Walt Whitman termed "embezzlers." In 1875 Somerby assumed the liabilities of
      Butts &amp; Co.; see Whitman's ,
      letter to Asa K. Butts &amp; Company. This proved to be a matter of
      embarrassment to Somerby, who, in reply to a lost letter on March 16, 1875, was
      unable "to remit the amount you name at present." On , he wrote: "It is very mortifying to me not to be in a
      position to send you even a small portion of the balance your due." On , Somerby sent $10—his only cash
      payment: "Have made every exertion to raise the $200 you require, and find it
      utterly impossible to get it. . . . We had hoped that you would accept our offer
      to get out your new book, and thus more than discharge our indebtedness to you."
      On , Somerby reported that "I have
      been losing, instead of gaining." On ,
      he sent Walt Whitman a statement pertaining to the volumes mentioned in this
      letter. On , he included a complete
      financial statement: in eighteen months he had made only one cash payment, and
      owed Walt Whitman $215.17. The firm was still unable to make a payment on . In August 1877, Walt Whitman
      received a notice of bankruptcy dated August 8, 1877,
       from, in his
      own words, "assignee [Josiah Fletcher, an attorney] of the rascal Chas P.
      Somerby." These manuscripts are in the Charles E. Feinberg Collection.
