   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00604_n2">1. This letter dates to October
      10, 1871. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman dated the letter October 10, a Tuesday.
      Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to letter 1871, and October 10 fell on
      Tuesday in 1871. Clarence Gohdes and Ronald G. Silver assigned the same date,
      and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and Silver's date (see Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:369; <em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections:
         Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina:
      Duke University Press, 1949], 203–204). Louisa's month is not clearly
      written, but the pressure from sons Thomas Jefferson Whitman and George
      Washington Whitman for Louisa to leave Brooklyn for Camden and the publication
      of Jean Bruce Washburn's <em>Yo Semite: A Poem</em> dates the
      letter to the year assigned by Bucke and subsequent editors.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00604_n7">2. The persons designated "aunt
      freelove" and "daughter elizabeth" have not been identified. However, the <em>United States Census, 1880</em> lists an Elizabeth Freelove
      (1820?–) from Queens, New York, and Freelove Day (1855?–) as a
      daughter (see <em>United States Census, 1880</em>, Queens, New
      York).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">3. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00604_n13">4. George Washington Whitman
      married Louisa Orr Haslam (1842–1892), called "Loo" or "Lou" in Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman's letters, in spring 1871, and Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and son
      Edward moved from Brooklyn to reside with them in Camden at 322 Stevens Street
      in August 1872.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">5. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00604_n12">6. The letter from Thomas
      Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman that insisted on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's "breaking
      up houskeeping" is not extant. Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, Jeff's wife,
      did not mention the matter in her October 22, 1871 letter to Louisa (see Randall
      H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell
         Whitman</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 72–76).
      Louisa delayed her departure from Brooklyn to Camden until August 1872.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">7. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00604_n14">8. After Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman and son Edward moved in with George Washington Whitman and wife Louisa
      Orr Haslam in August 1872, Walt Whitman sent monthly payments for Edward's
      board.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00604_n1">9. James "Jimmy" Whitman was
      the oldest son of Walt Whitman's brother Andrew Jackson Whitman
      (1827–1863) and Andrew's widow Nancy McClure. Jimmy was in the care of
      George Washington Whitman and wife Louisa Orr in late 1871. For a more extended
      description of Jimmy, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman. For Andrew's wife
      and children, see Jerome M. Loving, ed., <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html">"Introduction,"</a>
