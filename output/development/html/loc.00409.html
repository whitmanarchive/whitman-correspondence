      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I was glad to hear—from your letter to mother—that you had received my letters—containing
      the $10. &amp;c.<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—Everything is all right with us,—the same as ever. Mary and Louisa<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> are down with us. Came on Friday—will probably stay till Wednesday, down shopping
      &nbsp;They are all well. Ancel<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> is down on the coast fishing. George<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is still on the cars. The rest are all the same.<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> We have quite a joke on Mother which I bring forward almost every time she asks me
      if I have heard from you, which is everytime she sees me &nbsp;'tis this. during the time that we were so long without hearing from
      you Mother really got very much worried about you and when I went home to dinner on the day before we got your letter, she
      asked me as usual if I had heard and when I told her no she said "well I cannot imagine
      what is the matter with Walt. I feel very much worried indeed. one thing is sure he
      is either sick or else he is coming home" &nbsp;You can readily imagine how mother looked
      when I poked fun at her and repeated it to her. She says that she didnt say it so it sounded like I say it, &amp;c &nbsp;Dear Mother, she would be mighty glad to
      see you I know, but I love to plague her &nbsp;she will then take Hattie and say that sis
      is the only one of us that has got any sense, and if it wasnt for you and George she should not have much to live for &amp;c, &amp;c &nbsp;I hope you will be
      able to get me a copy of Capt. Mullens' report<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> &nbsp;also I hope you will give him a letter to Mr Lane.<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I like to know such men &nbsp;I can learn from them. I spend quite a good deal of time
      lately with Dr Ruggles.<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> He comes in the office quite often and I call at his house and see him. There are
      a good many things about him to like, I think and he seems to like me. I still continue
      to go to the Opera once in a while. To night is said to be the last night of the season
      but I hardly think that they will leave.<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> it seems to me to be paying to well. The houses are generally full. We have not heard
      from Han since I wrote you last. Mother thinks that she will get Mary to go on for
      her pretty soon. I suppose it is best that Han should come home but I fear for Mother.
      I fear that she will undertake in her usual way to do too much &nbsp;I was awful mad at Heydes last letter. If I had been
      in his neighborhood I should certainly have booted him. He is a damn fool. Hattie
      is in first rate condition &nbsp;she reminds me more of a young colt or dog than a child.
      It seems to be perfect pleasure for her just to get out into the open air. She dont seem to care to go any where, only outdoors. Yesterday Mother locked the front basement
      door while she went to some other part of the house a moment—to keep Hattie in. Hattie
      went in the front basement and shoved the window and was out and away leaving her
      Opandmouth in amazement abt how she got out. But altogether she is as affectionate and good as it seems to me
      for a human being (and I dont suppose there is anything better) to be.<sup><a href="#loc.00409_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> Mattie sends her love.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00409_n1">1. See Edwin Haviland
      Miller, ed. <em>The Correspondence</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77), 1:87.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n2">2. Born in 1845, Louisa
      was the third of five children of Jeff's sister Mary Whitman Van Nostrand
      (Katherine Molinoff, <em>Some Notes on Whitman's Family</em>,
      Monographs on Unpublished Whitman Material, no. 2 (Brooklyn: Comet Press, 1941),
      4).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n3">3. Ansel Van Nostrand, a
      shipwright, lived with his wife Mary in the whaling village of Greenport, Long
      Island.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n4">4. Born in 1841, George
      was the oldest of the Van Nostrand children. One supposes from Jeff's reference
      that the young George was a streetcar driver; later he would go into insurance
      (Molinoff, 4, n. 3).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n5">5. The other Van Nostrand
      children were Fanny (b. 1843) and Minnie (b. 1857). Another child, Ansel (b.
      1847), died in infancy (Molinoff, 4, n. 3).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n6">6. Captain John Mullan
      (1830–1909), an army engineer, was associated with General Isaac I.
      Stevens in his surveys for a railroad route to the West (U.S. Topographical
      Bureau, <em>Report of Exploration of a Route for the Pacific
         Railroad Near the 47th and 49th Parallels From St. Paul to Puget Sound</em>
      [Washington, D.C.: A. O. P. Nicholson, 1860]). When Whitman met Mullan, Mullan
      was about to publish his <em>Report on the Construction of a
         Military Road From Fort Walla-Walla to Fort Benton</em> (Washington, D.C.:
      Government Publications Office, 1863). In a notebook entry for April 1863
      (Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of Walt Whitman, The Library of Congress,
      Notebook #76), Whitman referred to both of these reports. In a letter to his
      mother from , Walt had praised
      "Capt. Mullin, U.S. Army (engineer), who has been six years out in the Rocky
      Mt's, making a gov't road, 650 miles from Ft. Benton to Walla Walla—very, very
      interesting to know such men intimately, and talk freely with them." A
      transcontinental railroad had long fascinated Whitman; he later wrote an
      editorial on the subject in 1858 while he was editor of the <em>Brooklyn Daily Times</em> (see Gay Wilson Allen, <em>The
         Solitary Singer</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1955], 213). Walt
      celebrated the completion of the railroad in his poem, "Passage to
      India."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n7">7. Moses Lane
      (1823–82) served as chief engineer of the Brooklyn Water Works from 1862
      to 1869. He later designed and constructed the Milwaukee Water Works and served
      there as city engineer. For an earlier reference to the letter, see Jeff's
      letter to Walt from .<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n8">8. The Brooklyn physician
      Edward Ruggles (1817?–1867) befriended the Whitman family and became
      especially close to Jeff and Mattie. Late in life, Ruggles lost interest in his
      practice and devoted himself to painting cabinet pictures called "Ruggles Gems"
      (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:90, n. 85; 330).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n9">9. The New York Academy of
      Music had announced April 20, 1863, as the last night of its opera season but
      went on to produce at least six more operas with members of Maretzek's troupe,
      concluding on May 23.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00409_n10">10. Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman was considerably less charmed by Hattie's antics. Six months later, on
      Christmas Day 1863, she remarked to Walt, "i really think hattie is the worst
      child i ever had any thing to doo with" (Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke
      University Rare Books, Manuscript, and Special Collections Library).<a href="#r10">[back]
