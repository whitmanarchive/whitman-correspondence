      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I send you Jeff's<sup><a href="#n0710" id="r1">1</a></sup> letter<sup><a href="#duk.00662_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> to me, just received. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mat<sup><a href="#n0707" id="r3">3</a></sup> is better, it seems, &amp; has put off journeying to Camden. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeff says it is doubtful whether she will come at all, unless she can have you go
      home with
      her to St. Louis. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, just let the thing take its course, &amp; not disturb your mind on the question
      of
      going or not going—It will be time enough to decide, when it comes to the
      point—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mammy dear, I got your letter this morning—glad to hear you are as well as you are,
      &amp; hope this will find you comfortable—All goes well as usual with me—Love to
      you, dear mother—&amp; to all<sup><a href="#duk.00662_n2" id="r4">4</a></sup>—

      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Mother, just as I was closing this letter, who should come in to see me but Margaret
      Avery<sup><a href="#duk.00662_n3" id="r5">5</a></sup>—she has been down to Virginia, and is going
      through Baltimore &amp; Philadelphia—When in Philadelphia, she will come over to
      Camden &amp; make you a call—probably within a day or two—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0710">1. Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1833–1890), known as
      "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a civil engineer, Jeff
      eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and a nationally
      recognized name. Whitman probably had his brother in mind when he praised the
      marvels of civil engineering in poems like "Passage to India." Though their
      correspondence slowed in the middle of their lives, the brothers were brought
      together again by the deaths of Jeff's wife Martha (known as Matty) in 1873 and
      his daughter Manahatta in 1886. Jeff's death in 1890 caused Walt to reminisce in
      his obituary, "how we loved each other—how many jovial good times we had!" For
      more on Thomas Jefferson Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00662_n1">2. In his letter of , Jeff suggested that Martha go to Camden and
      accompany Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to St. Louis. Of Martha Jeff wrote: "Her
      chest and lungs both seem better now and if by [care?] I can get her in the way
      of taking some little food I have hopes she will get along yet."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0707">3. Martha Mitchell Whitman (d. 1873) known as "Mattie,"
      was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and
      Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to St. Louis to join Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume
      the position of Superintendent of Water Works. Mattie experienced a throat
      ailment that would lead to her death in 1873.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00662_n2">4. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman was not entirely
      happy in Camden, for about  she
      complained to Walt Whitman: "lou and george are very clever but i think they are
      a very saving couple. what they want to save so much for i cant see as they have
      no young ones but maybe its all right. george is so changed in regard to being
      saving but i cant get used to being so 
      ecomical

   <p id="duk.00662_n3">5. Margaret and William Avery, who lived in
      Brooklyn, were evidently cousins of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. They visited Walt
      Whitman in Camden on October 19, 1876; see Whitman's Commonplace Book (Charles
      E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library
      of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r5">[back]
