   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n4281">1. C. H. Browning worked in the
      Philadelphia office of the <em>New York Herald</em>, and he later
      worked in the same capacity for the <em>New York World</em>.
      Whitman described Browning as "a fine, dark-browed, vital, affectionate sort of
      a man—a newspaper man made of the real stuff" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.29.html">Sunday, August 12, 1888</a>). Browning convinced Whitman to write "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/published/periodical/poems/per.00052.html">A Voice from the Death</a>," a poem on the Johnstown flood that was
      printed in the <em>World</em> on June 7, 1889.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="yal.00241_n2">2. On March 2 Walt Whitman
      had sent a bill to the New York Herald for $100 for the pieces printed in
      January and February (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection
      of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.). And see the  letter to Richard
      Maurice Bucke.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4133">3. In late 1887, James Gordon Bennett,
      Jr., editor of the <em>New York Herald</em>, invited Whitman to
      contribute a series of poems and prose pieces for the paper. From December 1887
      through August 1888, 33 of Whitman's poems appeared.<a href="#r3">[back]
