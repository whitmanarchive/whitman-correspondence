      <br></br><br></br>My dear Charles Hine,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received with gladness the authentic sign &amp; proof that you are on hand &amp;
      doing, viz. "Watsons Art Journal"<sup><a href="#loc.01579_n3" id="r2">2</a></sup> with notice &amp;c.—I am anxious
      to see the picture. I am sure it must be a thing of beauty, glowing, human, &amp;
      true. Believe me, my friend, I have not forgotten you, nor your old kindness &amp;
      friendliness. Also Mrs. Hine &amp; the daughter—to whom I send best
      remembrances. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As soon as I come to New York again, I will visit you at the studio. In the meantime,
      I send you by same mail as this a copy of my last edition, also a little book,
      written by Mr. Burroughs,<sup><a href="#loc.01579_n4" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      (a second Thoreau,) and a newspaper, with letter<sup><a href="#loc.01579_n5" id="r4">4</a></sup>—the book &amp; letter all about my precious
      self—&amp; I dare say may interest you. If the books are not brought by the
      carrier, you must send to p. o. for them. I have seen Faris<sup><a href="#loc.01579_n6" id="r5">5</a></sup> here, but now he has
      gone back to N. Y. I am working in the Attorney General's office—have a
      pleasant berth, moderate pay, but sufficient—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am well, weight nearly 200, &amp; eat my rations every time. You must write, &amp;
      let me know whether the books come safe. 
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Charles Hine (1827–1871) was a portrait and
      figure painter best known for his nude figure entitled <em>Sleep</em>. Hine did an early oil painting of Walt Whitman, the engraving
      of which served as the basis for Stephen Alonzo Schoff's engraving of the poet
      for <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1860).

      "'Sleep': Painted by Charles Hine." The article described his painting of a
      female nude, and concluded: "We know no picture of modern date that is in any
      way comparable with it. It is a work, necessarily sensuous, but utterly devoid
      of sensuality."<a href="#r2">[back]
