      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mother
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I have just heard that there will be a chance to send letters home this morning, and
      I improve the oppernitunity to let you know that I am all right so far. We had a pretty hard battle on the 6th.
      I dont know what the battle is called but it was about 5 miles from Germania Ford
      on the Rapidan River.<sup><a href="#duk.00354_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> our Regt. suffered severely loseing 70 in killed and wounded.<sup><a href="#duk.00354_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> I lost nearly half of my Co but we won the fight and the rebel loss was pretty heavy.
      We came here on the 8th and there has been fighting going on every day since we came
      here.<sup><a href="#duk.00354_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> We have had the best of the fighting so far and its my opinion that Genl Grant has
      got Lee in a pretty tight spot. We had a severe fight here on the 12th and the loss
      was heavy on both sides &nbsp;our Regt lost 20 in killed and wounded &nbsp;our forces took about
      8000 prisoner[s?] and 40 peices of Artillery.
   </p>
   
   <p>We are now lying in Rifle pitts and things are very quiet this morning. We have plenty to eat and get along very
      well.
   </p>
   
   <p>The Army is in first rate spirits and everyone seems confident and hopefull. I have not time to say much at present Mother but when I do get time I will write
      you a good long letter. You must not feel at all worried about me but take things
      Cool and comfortable as I do and above all dont worry.
   </p>
   
   <p>Much love to all. Good Bye.</p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00354_n1">1. The Battle of the
      Wilderness (May 5â€“6, 1864). The Wilderness was a wooded area near
      Fredericksburg, Virginia. &nbsp;Union losses approached 18,000, of whom 2,000 were
      killed; the Confederate loss probably exceeded 10,000. The Ninth Army alone lost
      985 men, listed as killed, wounded, or missing.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00354_n2">2. Walt Whitman recorded in
      his diary for May 9, 1865, "Capt. Pooley asked me if I had seen the canteen
      struck while on George's side, in one of the Wilderness battles, &amp; half of
      it wrenched off" (Manuscripts of Walt Whitman in the Collection of American
      Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00354_n3">3. Rather than retreat after
      heavy losses in the Wilderness campaign, Grant pushed on to New Spotsylvania
      Court House in pursuit of General Lee.<a href="#r3">[back]
