   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Johnston (d. 1918) was a
      physician from Bolton, England, who, with James W. Wallace, founded the "Bolton
      College" of English admirers of the poet. Johnston and Wallace corresponded with
      Whitman and with Horace Traubel and other members of the Whitman circle in the
      United States, and they separately visited the poet and published memoirs of
      their trips in John Johnston and James William Wallace, <em>Visits
         to Walt Whitman in 1890–1891 by Two Lancashire Friends</em> (London:
      Allen and Unwin, 1917). For more information on Johnston, see Larry D. Griffin,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_97.html">Johnston, Dr. John (d.1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

      Wallace, two fervid admirers from Bolton, England, wrote to Walt Whitman for the
      first time about the middle of May and sent a birthday gift of £10 ($48.70)
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Library of Congress, Washington D.C.). "We, two
      friends chiefly united by our common love of you, wish to congratulate you on
      your birthday, and express to you personally our very best wishes and love. To
      you we owe not only affection but endless gratitude and reverence. One of us, a
      doctor, owes to you entirely his spiritual enfranchisement and deliverance from
      soul-be-numbing scepticism, into which—not without pain—he had
      gradually fallen. Your books are his constant companions, his spiritual
      nourishment, his continual study and delight. . . ." The other in many
      obstructions and difficulties is strengthened and comforted by your example and
      words. In past heavy bereavement (of a mother to whom he has often mentally
      applied the words you use of yours) your words have best
      tallied his deepest experiences and hopes . . ." (County Borough of Bolton
      (England) Public Libraries).<a href="#r2">[back]
