      <br></br>My friends:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have now just ready an article intended as the third &amp; concluding one to the
      two already published by you, on "Democracy" and "Personalism." 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>This is upon the general subject of a needed American <em>Literature,
         in the highest sense</em>, &amp; of our imaginative, mental, &amp;c. growths,
      home-born, appropriate to &amp; towering high enough for, The States, &amp;
      faithfully in the interests of their Democratic institutions. I have, of course,
      treated the subject in my own way—certain parts strong &amp; earnest—but
      there is nothing in it to make the piece at all improper for the
      magazine—probably indeed may be found more appropriate &amp;
      serviceable—more to rouse editorial &amp; critical remark, &amp;c—than
      the already published articles. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I propose to you to print it in the Galaxy for July. It will make from eleven to
      twelve pages in your new form &amp; type. The name is 
      
      
      <br><br><span class="indent"><em>Orbic Literature</em>.<sup><a href="#loc.01286_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup></span><br><br>
      
      
       The price, if satisfactory, will be the same as for each of the previous
      articles, viz: $100.<sup><a href="#loc.01286_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> I reserve the right of printing it in future book. I can send it on
      immediately.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think it will be best not to delay too long, as the interest in the thing is now
      up, something like a serial story. This is the conclusion, &amp; I should like to
      have it in July number.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01286_n1">1. William Conant Church
      (1836–1917), journalist and publisher, was a correspondent for several New
      York newspapers until he founded the <em>Army and Navy
         Journal</em> in 1863. With his brother Francis Pharcellus (1839–1906),
      he established the <em>Galaxy</em> in 1866. Financial control of
      the <em>Galaxy</em> passed to Sheldon and Company in 1868, and it
      was absorbed by the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> in 1878. William
      published a biography of his life-long friend Ulysses S. Grant in 1897, and
      Francis wrote for the New York <em>Sun</em> the unsigned piece
      "Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus." See Edward F. Grier, "Walt Whitman, the
      <em>Galaxy</em>, and <em>Democratic
         Vistas</em>," <em>American Literature</em>, 23 (1951–1952),
      332–350; Donald N. Bigelow, <em>William Conant Church
         &amp;</em> "The Army and Navy Journal" (New York: Columbia University Press,
      1952); J. R. Pearson, Jr., "Story of a Magazine: New York's <em>Galaxy</em>, 1866–1878," <em>Bulletin of the New York

      , Francis P. Church wrote that,
      after consultation with new financier Mr. Sheldon, "I am obliged to come to the
      conclusion that for the present at least, it is best that it should not be
      published in The Galaxy." The essay finally appeared in <em>Democratic Vistas</em>.<a href="#r2">[back]

   <p id="loc.01286_n3">3. Though Whitman cited $100 as
      his fee for previous articles to the <em>Galaxy</em>, he accepted
      $75 for "Personalism" in his  letter
      to Sheldon and Company.<a href="#r3">[back]
