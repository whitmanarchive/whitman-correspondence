   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04038_n1">1. The date is established
      by an entry in Whitman's Commonplace Book. Riley was an ardent young Englishman
      who addressed Whitman as "My dear Friend and Master" on . Twelve years earlier he had found a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> "and saw a Revelation. . . . In all my
      troubles and successes I have been strengthened by your divine teachings." Riley
      wanted a copy of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> for Ruskin, who, upon
      reading a few extracts from Whitman's poems, pronounced them "glorious": "He is
      a stern critic, and as honest as God or a tree." On  Riley noted receipt of the book and photographs, and on  he quoted from a note sent to him by
      Ruskin: "I am glad to know that I can give some pleasure to such a man."
      Although Ruskin did not write to the poet, Whitman informed the New York <em>Sun</em> on April 15 that "he did not feel at liberty to
      divulge the exact contents of the letter." See also the Camden <em>Daily Post</em> of May 12 and the letter from Whitman to John Burroughs of
       (Whitman's Commonplace Book,
      Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919,
      Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
