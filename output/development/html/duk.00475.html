   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00475_n14">1. This letter dates to
      February 27, 1867. The date "February 27" is in Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's
      hand, and Richard Maurice Bucke assigned the year 1867. Edwin Haviland Miller
      cited Bucke's year (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New
      York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 1:378). The date is correct.
      Walt Whitman forwarded two almanacs the previous day (see his  letter to Louisa), and Louisa
      acknowledged receipt of the almanacs.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">2. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00475_n11">3. Mustard plasters were a
      mustard paste that was applied to a cloth or paper, which was then applied to
      skin, generally with an intervening layer of cloth or paper. The paste,
      sometimes diluted, was typically applied to the abdomen and was held to relieve
      pain by increasing bloodflow or by drawing excess blood from the inflamed or
      painful area. Mustard, a strong irritant, would produce blisters if allowed to
      remain in contact with skin. See <em>Health at Home, or Hall's
         Family Doctor</em> (Hartford: J. A. S. Betts, 1873), 297.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00465_n9">4. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York
      University Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00474_n4">5. Julius "Jules" Mason
      (1835–1882) was a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Cavalry and a career
      army officer. Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman wrote that Mason "used to be in my
      party on the Water Works" (see his  letter to Walt). Jules Mason's sister Irene was a close friend of
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt; see Randall H. Waldron,
      ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New
      York: New York University Press, 1977], 37, 42). Jules and Irene were the
      children of Gordon F. Mason, a prominent Pennsylvania businessman. When Jeff
      departed for St. Louis in early May 1867, Mattie stayed at the Mason home in
      Towanda, Pennsylvania (Waldron, 37).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">6. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00475_n9">7. Walt Whitman had sent his
      mother two almanacs: "both are calculated for <em>this</em>
      region, not New York, &amp; one is a sort of Catholic almanac—I saw it had
      all the Saints' days" (see his 
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). Walt again sent his mother an almanac the
      following year (see her  letter
      to Walt).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n6">8. Mary Elizabeth (Whitman) Van
      Nostrand (1821–1899) was the oldest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's younger sister. She married Ansel
      Van Nostrand, a shipwright, in 1840, and they subsequently moved to Greenport,
      Long Island. They raised five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and
      Mary Isadore "Minnie." See Jerome M. Loving, ed., "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html#n32">Introduction</a>," <em>Civil War Letters of George
         Washington Whitman</em> (Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1975), 10–11.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00438_n4">9. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r9">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00475_n7">10. At the time of this letter,
      Walt Whitman lived at 472 M Street in Washington, D.C. He had been living with
      Mr. and Mrs. Newton Benedict for a few weeks, after the death of Juliet Grayson
      (see his  letter to Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman).<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00475_n13">11. Walt Whitman described the
      injuries and outlook for a soldier named Andrew J. Kephart as "very bad with
      bleeding at the lungs—it is doubtful if he recovers" in his  letter to Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman, and he provided an update two weeks later (see his  letter to Louisa). On , he reported that Kephart "is quite
      recovered." Walt identified the soldier's regiment as "44th Reg. Infantry";
      however, the National Park Service's Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System
      includes only one Andrew J. (or A.) Kephart, a member of the 13th Regiment,
      Maryland Infantry
      (http://www.nps.gov/civilwar/soldiers-and-sailors-database.htm).<a href="#r11">[back]
