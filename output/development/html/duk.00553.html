   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00553_n11">1. This letter dates to
      November 11, 1868. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman did not provide any form of a
      date for the letter, but the letter does refer to the day before as Tuesday.
      Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter November 11, 1868, a Wednesday, and
      Edwin Haviland Miller cited Bucke's date (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press,
      1961–77], 2:70–71, n. 31; 2:366). The date November, 11, 1868,
      accords with a recent throat operation for Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman
      in Brooklyn, but Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's statement about an
      architectural drawing that George Washington Whitman has received raises
      some doubt about the date.<br><br>
      After Mattie's arrival in Brooklyn to visit a physician in October, Walt
      reported to his brother Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman that the physician
      hoped to have a better sense of Mattie's health within "ten or twelve days"
      after a surgery (see his 
      letter to Jeff). Louisa's 
      letter to Walt must date after Walt's letter and before this letter both
      because Mattie's surgery remained in the future in that letter and because
      George went to Camden "last night" and is expected to stay there through
      November 21. Mattie's throat surgery was performed, presumably, shortly
      after Louisa's November 4 letter to Walt, and this letter dates November 11,
      the Wednesday after Mattie's surgery. However, the letter also states that
      George "has got a draw of the two houses they talk of building." If the
      statement implies that George has returned to Brooklyn, it contradicts his
      plan to be away at Camden for over two weeks. However, Louisa explained in
      her  letter to Walt that
      George was inclined to return more often than every two weeks (that amount
      of time is required for return trip to be paid by the Brooklyn Water Board),
      because he is "carried away by somebody." According to Louisa's  letter, George "is away."
      Even if George was not then in Brooklyn, his receipt of an architectural
      drawing could have alternate explanations: he may have received the drawing
      in Camden, which Louisa forwarded or received on his behalf, or he returned
      briefly to Brooklyn and was again away. The matter of George's architectural
      drawing can only be resolved by a surmise about what was probable.
      Regardless, this letter cannot date to the Wednesday after November 11
      because Jeff Whitman's arrival in Brooklyn was not expected until the
      following week (see Louisa's 
      letter to Walt). Despite the doubts raised by George's drawings, this letter
      must nonetheless date to the Wednesday between Louisa's November 4 and her
      November 18 letters to Walt.<a href="#r1">[back]

      Heyde (1823–1908), Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's younger daughter, resided
      in Burlington, Vermont, with husband Charles Louis Heyde (1822–1890), a
      French-born landscape painter. Charles Heyde was infamous among the Whitmans for
      his offensive letters and poor treatment of Hannah. In late 1868 Hannah suffered
      a thumb infection that led Doctor Samuel W. Thayer to lance her wrist in
      November and to amputate her thumb the following month (see Charles L. Heyde's
      letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 1868, Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G.

   <p id="duk.00465_n9">5. Martha Mitchell Whitman
      (1836–1873), known as "Mattie," was the wife of Thomas Jefferson "Jeff"
      Whitman, Walt Whitman's brother. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta and
      Jessie Louisa. In 1868, Mattie and her daughters moved to St. Louis to join
      Jeff, who had moved there in 1867 to assume the position of Superintendent of
      Water Works. For more on Mattie, see Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York

      (1833–1910) was an employee at the Brooklyn Water Works from 1856 to 1868,
      an assistant engineer in the Department of City Works, and a principal engineer
      on the Brooklyn Water Board from 1871 to 1875. According to a brief newspaper
      profile a decade later, he was the "handsomest man on the entire bridge force"
      ("Samuel R. Probasco," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, May 24,
      1883, 5). For more on Probasco, also see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's  letter to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n13">8. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]

   <p id="duk.00553_n12">9. It is not clear whether
      this word is "off," superimposed over a word that began with the letter "g" or a
      canceled word. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman may have begun to write the name
      "george" but decided instead to continue the previous phrase that described
      Edward: he is "very bad) off." The reading then is a letter "o" in "off" over a
      partially canceled "g" in "george" but with the vertical mark after "bad"
      uncanceled. Or Louisa may have intended to cancel the entire word but neglected
      to cancel the second "f."<a href="#r9">[back]

   <p id="duk.00425_n2">10. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
