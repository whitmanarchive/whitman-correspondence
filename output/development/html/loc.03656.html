      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>My friend Morse was much pleased to have your invitation to come, and he intended
      to do so about this time, but he writes me now that he has unexpectedly been called
      back to Boston this week.
   </p>
   
   <p>He means, he says,
      
      
      
      to make a special trip to see you just after New-years. I hope he will, and that he
      will come to Washington at the same time.
   </p>
   
   <p>You said in your last letter you still intended to come to Washington this Winter.
      So I defer my visit to you. I know you would not Expect me on the 5th inst,
      
      
      
      
      as I was to write if I came.
   </p>
   
   <p>My wife and I Earnestly hope we may see you at our house soon.</p>
   
   <p>All my Thought of late, Walt, is of you, and your great work. I read and reread your
      poems, and the "Vistas," and more and more see that I had but a faint comprehension
      of them before. They surpass everything.
      
      
      
      All other books seem to me weak and unworthy my attention.
   </p>
   
   <p>I read, Sunday, to my wife, Longfellows [
      <span class="unclear">Horses?</span>]
       on Sumner, in the last <em>Atlantic</em>, and in I read your poem on the <em>Death of Lincoln</em>. It was like listening to a weak-voiced girl singing with piano accompaniment, and
      then to an oratorio of the whole Handed Society, with accompanyment by [illegible] music [illegible] organ. My wife appreciated the difference [illegible]. I think I shall have to print the two side by side in my [
      <span class="unclear">article?</span>]
      if I ever write it. The comparison would be very significant. Trouble with me now
      is that the subject overpowers me. I am in aweâ€”and dare not put pen to paper.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Joseph B. Marvin, a friend and
      an admirer of Whitman's poetry, was from 1866 to 1867 the co-editor of the <em>Radical</em>. He was then appointed as a clerk in the Treasury
      Department in Washington, on behalf of which he took a trip to London in the
      late fall of 1875. On , Whitman
      wrote a letter to William Michael Rossetti to announce a visit from Marvin.
      Rossetti gave a dinner for Marvin, which was attended by the following "good
      Whitmanites": Anne Gilchrist; Joseph Knight, editor of the London <em>Sunday Times</em>; Justin McCarthy, a novelist and writer for
      the London <em>Daily News</em>; Edmund Gosse; and Rossetti's
      father-in-law, Ford Madox
      Brown.
