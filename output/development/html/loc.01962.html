      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I received the Washington newspaper with your new poem, for which I hasten to thank
      you. It is, I think, in your finest style. The conception is most impressive: for
      this transference to the unseen spiritual influences of the night, of what the poet
      feels of past splendor, &amp; of Love and Struggle in the present life, &amp; of
      Faith for the future, strikes somehow  a soul-thrilling &amp; elevating chord that tunes the whole poem
      to the pitch of a Heroic Symphony. Movements v &amp; viii are especially grand. Who
      indeed but you are the Singer of Love &amp; Faith in their new advent?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have nothing worthy to send you in return. But yet I must exchange my token for
      yours—brazen for golden gifts, as the Greek poet said.  Therefore I venture to enclose a study
      of Greek friendship. The misfortune of my poem is that it presupposes much knowledge
      of antiquity—as for instance that this Aristodemus returning alone from Thermopylae
      to Sparta was visited there with universal disgrace, that the Spartan youths lived
      not at home but in bands called "Herds," that the Spartans sacrificed to Love as the
      inspirer of Heroism before engaging in battle, &amp; that, as a mere matter of
      recorded history, Callicrates<sup><a href="#loc.01962_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> was  the most beautiful man among the
      Spartans &amp; that he died in the ranks at the very opening of the battle of
      Platea. You to whom all things seem at first sight clear will need no further
      explanation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I wrote to you some days since. More now I will not add—except that</p>

      I am ever yours

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Addington Symonds, a
      prominent biographer, literary critic, and poet in Victorian England, was in his
      time most famous as the author of the seven-volume history <em>Renaissance in Italy</em>. But in the smaller circles of the emerging
      upper-class English homosexual community, he was also well known as a writer of
      homoerotic poetry and a pioneer in the study of homosexuality, or sexual
      inversion as it was then known (<em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings [New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998], 701).
