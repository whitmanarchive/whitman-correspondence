      return from a visit to the Gilchrists in Philadelphia from November 18 to 20
      (Whitman's Commonplace Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of
      Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00062_n2">2. According to his
      Commonplace Book, Whitman sent <em>Two Rivulets</em> on September
      7 to Justin H. McCarthy, Jr. (1860–1936). On , McCarthy thanked him for the volume, and recalled that
      his father, the novelist, had met the poet in 1870; see also Gay Wilson Allen,
      <em>The Solitary Singer</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1955),
      418–419, and Justin McCarthy, <em>Reminiscences</em>
      (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1899), 1:258–261. McCarthy's unsigned review
      of <em>Two Rivulets</em>, "Songs Overseas," appeared in <em>The Examiner</em> on October 21. After praising Whitman's
      description of Lincoln's death, McCarthy observed: "Could he apply this power to
      the whole as to this chapter, Walt Whitman might abandon all other titles for
      that of America's first historian."<a href="#r2">[back]
