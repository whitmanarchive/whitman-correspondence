   </p>
   
   <p>As you see by my address I am staying with a great friend of yours. You may see him
      this summer for he is going to America at the end of April,—going out as a
      schoolmaster to settle somewhere up the Hudson. He is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet
      earnest serious soul and very practical, full of solid worth,
      whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be valued in America. His father is a
      clergyman,  and
      this son of his reads Leaves of Grass silently unobserved by the rest of his orthodox
      family.
   </p>
   
   <p>I posted a copy of my book<sup><a href="#loc.05995_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> to you about a week ago: I hope that you will read it and
      tell me how you like it.
   </p>
   
   <p>Andrew Lang<sup><a href="#n3116" id="r3">3</a></sup> wrote a leader in the Daily News about it and fine
      things have been said in the London, and <u>Scotch Press</u>
      particularly. As yet, I have not taken
      my passage, but I hope to come early in May, and to spend a nice slice of my time
      near you in Camden. I consider that your poems have gained ground here perceptibly
      within the last 2 years. Leonard Brown sends his love &amp;
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="upa.00088_n3">1. Leonard M. Brown, a young
      English schoolteacher and friend of Herbert Gilchrist, came to America in May,
      1887. On  Gilchrist wrote to
      Whitman: "he is an uncommonly good fellow, quiet earnet serious soul and very
      practical, full of solid worth, whose knowledge and attainments are sure to be
      valued in America. His father is a clergyman, and this son of his reads Leaves
      of Grass silently &amp; unobserved by the sect of his orthodox family." An entry
      in Whitman's Commonplace Book on August 29 reads: "Leonard Morgan Brown goes
      back to Croton-on-Hudson—has been here ab't a week" (Charles E. Feinberg
      Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress,
      Washington, D.C.). See also Whitman's letter to Leonard Brown of ; his letter to Herbert Gilchrist
      of , note 2; and his letter to

      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
