   <p>Your 'Nov Boughs'<sup><a href="#n3999" id="r1">1</a></sup> is recieved, and was appreciated most highly—I assure you. But
      this is quite rudely dashed by a debilitating sickness, which her physicians
      pronounce severe jaundice, and which the utmost care to ensure her early
      recovery—We brought her bed down in our best room—She is looking much
      emaciated, but is made more comfortable by the change. She has allways rallied so
      effectualy from former attacks, relying solely upon  upon her hereditary constitution
      that I was greatly surprised and overcome—She recieved the 1 dollar—this
      necessiates the aid of a little more money—say to buy ½ ton of coal, and
      other necessaries, perhaps, say 5 dollars, and if George<sup><a href="#n0700" id="r2">2</a></sup> could add as much more, so
      much better—one doctor says she will improve in a short time, the other is
      not so certain. Should mail any money, I would be [
      <span class="unclear">glad?</span>]
       that it be addressed to the
      care of G. W. Beckwith, Post Master—cause, she was very nervous when she discovered
      that I had written to you some time ago, and this must be avoided—Kind neighbors
      are near her—I will inform you daily of her condition—she had just laid, or changed
      her carpet for the winter—

      infamous among the Whitmans for his offensive letters and poor treatment of

   <p id="n0700">2. George Washington Whitman (1829–1901) was the
      sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and ten years Walt Whitman's junior.
      George enlisted in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil
      War. He was wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and
      was taken prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). As a
      Civil War correspondent, Walt wrote warmly about George's service, such as in
      "" (January 5,
      1863); ""
      (January 19, 1865); ""
      (March 12, 1865); and ""
      (August 5, 1865). After the war, George returned to Brooklyn and began building
      houses on speculation, with partner Mr. Smith and later a mason named French.
      George also took a position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. Walt
      and George lived together for several years in Camden, but when Walt decided not
      to move with George and his wife Louisa in 1884, a rift occurred that was
      ultimately not mended before Walt's 1892 death. For more information on George
      Washington Whitman, see Martin G. Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
