      Dear Sir
      
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      In your "Specimen days &amp; collects" p. 327. (American Ed 4th.) 
      speaking of American
      society you designate the religion of Boston as "bloodless." The word surprises me
      as I always thought that the 
      greatest literateurs of the states such as Hawthorne, 
      Longfellow, Emerson, had given their [illegible]
      to that very religion you describe as bloodlessâ€”Unitarianism. 
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>
      Though surprised however I quite concur in the description. But may I ask if you think
      the church, Protestant or 
      Catholic is capable of grappling with the spiritual problems of our age?
      
   </p>
   
   <p>
      Mr. Froude the historian whose books I prize and who has written much on Ecclesiastical
      Matters has never 
      I think spoken
      
      so sharply or tersely of Unitarianism as you have done nor given any indication as
      to whether Christianity as the 
      Church teaches it is able to mould the centuries to come. 
      
   </p>   
   
   <p>    
      As I am deeply interested in this question it would be a great favour if you would
      write me a line or two
      
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      
      Yours faithfully

      P.S. Have you a first Edition (American) of "November Boughs" to sell. If you kindly
      let me know I shall forward 
      the price. J.O.
