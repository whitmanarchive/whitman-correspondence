      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt:
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>I was rejoiced to get your card of yesterday this morning.<sup><a href="#loc.03349_n3" id="r1">1</a></sup></p>
   
   <p>The blindness still continues, but with half an eye I send you a word to let you know
      that I'm not dead yet, no more than you are, dear friend! The pleasing little malady
      of the eyelid which has inspired me to much eloquent, though silent, profanity, is
      called <u>ptosis</u>, a Greek name which is fully equivalent to
      Abaddon (and a bad'un it is: joke: two in  this style for one cent!) and
      consists in a paralysis of the first nerve of the eyelid. The doctor continues the
      
      battery, and promises relief soon, warning me not to use the other eye, which I
      don't, with slight exceptions, such as this one. Soon I hope to send you better than
      this myopian notelet.
   </p> 
   
   <p>I was glad to see Mrs. Costelloe's<sup><a href="#loc.02189_n1" id="r2">2</a></sup> letter, which I sent
      the next day to Dr. Bucke<sup><a href="#n0119" id="r3">3</a></sup> (old angel!) and have heard he got
      it.
   </p>  
   
   <p>I am pleased that Stedman<sup><a href="#n1043" id="r4">4</a></sup> wrote to you. I suppose it  included telling
      you the delay of the calendar<sup><a href="#loc.03349_n4" id="r5">5</a></sup>, for which I am not sorry on the whole, since it gives
      another chance to get the help of Stetson's grand Fuseli-pencil<sup><a href="#loc.03349_n5" id="r6">6</a></sup> for the design of another year.
      Grace is going to touch this spirit to fine issues if possible next twelve-month,
      when we hope he will be freer to work!
   </p>
   
   <p>—But, whoa! eye-destroying prose. Pegasus of the devil—It fills me with
      thanks that you still hold your own, dear Walt. I'll bet on you more  than on either
      Harrison or Cleveland!<sup><a href="#loc.03349_n1" id="r7">7</a></sup> (Apropos, what a delicious mess
      Bull-Sackville has got himself into! The tee-heeing and haw-hawing are
      multitudinous! Also the Democratic roars!<sup><a href="#loc.03349_n2" id="r8">8</a></sup>)
   </p>  
   
   <p>Nelly sends love. More annon.</p>

      It is endless rain!

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's

      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.02189_n1">2. Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe
      (1864–1945) was a political activist, art historian, and critic, whom
      Whitman once called his "staunchest living woman friend." A scholar of Italian
      Renaissance art and a daughter of Robert Pearsall Smith, she would in 1885 marry
      B. F. C. "Frank" Costelloe. She had been in contact with many of Whitman's
      English friends and would travel to Britain in 1885 to visit many of them,
      including Anne Gilchrist shortly before her death. For more, see Christina
      Davey, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_86.html">Costelloe, Mary Whitall Smith (1864–1945)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D.
      Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0119">3. Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n1043">4. Edmund Clarence Stedman
      (1833–1908) was a man of diverse talents. He edited for a year the <em>Mountain County Herald</em> at Winsted, Connecticut, wrote
      "Honest Abe of the West," presumably Lincoln's first campaign song, and served
      as correspondent of the <em>New York World</em> from 1860 to 1862.
      In 1862 and 1863 he was a private secretary in the Attorney General's office
      until he entered the firm of Samuel Hallett and Company in September, 1863. The
      next year he opened his own brokerage office. He published many volumes of poems
      and was an indefatigable compiler of anthologies, among which were <em>Poets of America</em>, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,
      1885) and <em>A Library of American Literature from the Earliest
         Settlement to the Present Time</em>, 11 vols. (New York: C. L. Webster,
      1889–90). For more, see Donald Yannella, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_107.html">Stedman, Edmund Clarence (1833–1908)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03349_n4">5. In 1887, the writer and
      editor Grace Ellery Channing (1862–1937), the niece of William D.
      O'Connor, had the idea of creating an illustrated calendar with excerpts from
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. The illustrations would be made by
      Walter Stetson. The project was never realized. For more on the calendar
      project, see see Joann Krieg, "Grace Ellery Channing and the Whitman Calendar,"
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 12, no. 4 (1995),
      252–256.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03349_n5">6. Henry Fuseli [Johann
      Heinrich Füssli] (1741–1825) was a Swiss painter who lived most of his
      life in England and whose many sketches were widely admired and influenced the
      younger generation of artists; his figures tended to be cast on a grand heroic
      scale.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03349_n1">7. Kennedy is referring to the
      1888 election between Republican candidate Benjamin Harrison and Democratic
      President Grover Cleveland, running for reelection. Cleveland, a native New
      Yorker, lost even though he received the majority of the popular vote.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.03349_n2">8. This is likely a reference
      to the Sackville-West Affair, a political ploy by a Republican supporter that
      tricked Lionel Sackville-West, British minister to the United States, to endorse
      Cleveland—a fact quickly used by the Harrison campaign to slander the
      president as too pro-British.<a href="#r8">[back]
