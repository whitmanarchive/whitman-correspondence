   <hr>
   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>William Michael Rossetti (1829–1915), brother
      of Dante Gabriel and Christina Rossetti, was an English editor and a champion of
      Whitman's work. In 1868 Rossetti edited Whitman's <em>Poems</em>,
      selected from the 1867 <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman referred
      to Rossetti's edition as a "horrible dismemberment of my book" in his , letter to F.S. Ellis. Nonetheless,
      the edition provided a major boost to Whitman's reputation, and Rossetti would
      remain a staunch supporter for the rest of Whitman's life, drawing in
      subscribers to the 1876 <em>Leaves of Grass</em> and fundraising
      for Whitman in England. For more on Whitman's relationship with Rossetti, see
      Sherwood Smith, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_48.html">Rossetti, William Michael (1829–1915)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="tex.00444_n1">1. Up to this time Whitman
      had received three payments from Rossetti amounting to $446.18 (see the letter
      from Whitman to Herbert Gilchrist of ). Including the gift from Carpenter and the Ford sisters (see his
      letter to Edward Carpenter of )
      Whitman received in 1885 from his English admirers a total of $686.01. In
      contrast, his royalties from McKay for the year totalled $42.77; he also
      received $24 from Worthington and about $47.50 from Scott (Whitman's Commonplace
      Book, Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman,
      1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.). In 1885 Whitman
      received at least $350.20 from sales of poems and articles: "Washington's
      Monument, February, 1885" ($10), "As One by One Withdraw the Lofty Actors"
      ($30), "Fancies at Navesink" ($145.20), "Booth and 'The Bowery'" ($60), "Slang
      in America" ($50), "Some Diary Notes at Random" ($10), "Abraham Lincoln" ($33),
      and "The Voice of the Rain" ($12). It could not be ascertained how much he
      received from <em>The Critic</em> for the right to reprint the
      poem on Grant or from the New York <em>Star</em> for "How Leaves
      of Grass Was Made."<a href="#r1">[back]
