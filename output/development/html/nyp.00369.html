   <p>I have rec'd your kind note, &amp; am pleased that you remember me. I shall select some scrap of my
      MS. &amp; send you soon. 
      The last fortnight I have had an extra spell of debility &amp; head distress, but feel
      better to-day.

   <p>Should you come to Philadelphia come over here, (by ferry from foot of Market st. Phila., very accessible) 
      &amp; see me, &amp; have a chat. I am leisurely preparing a Volume, "Two Rivulets,' (i.e.
      Real and Ideal) all sorts of things, 
      prose &amp; (my) poetry. Won't be out though for five or six months. Pleasant in some
      respects here, for me—but pretty lonesome.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="nyp.00369_n1">1. Whitman met Stedman
      during the Civil War; see Whitman's  letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. On , Stedman had requested "one scrap of paper, which you
      can spare. …I am one of those American writers who always look upon you as
      a noble, original, and characteristic poet" (Thomas Donaldson, <em>Walt Whitman, the Man</em> [London: Suckling &amp; Galloway, 1896],
      214).<a href="#r1">[back]
