   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      (1795–1873) married Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine
      children, of whom Walt Whitman was the second. For more information on Louisa
      and her letters, see Wesley Raabe, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/lvvwintro.html">"'walter dear': The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son
         Walt"</a> and Sherry Ceniza, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00597_n4">1. The date of this letter,
      July 5?, 1870, is somewhat speculative. Richard Maurice Bucke estimated the date
      as July 12, 1870. Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver agreed with Bucke's date
      (<em>Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt
         Whitman and His Family</em> [Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press,
      1949], 203), and Edwin Haviland Miller cited Gohdes and Silver's date (Walt
      Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New York
      University Press, 1961–77], 2:368). The letter, however, is more likely to
      date to a week earlier. The most useful detail for dating the letter is that
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman has had a photograph taken at the studio of William S.
      Pendleton. She plans to enclose a copy of the photograph in a box that she has
      prepared for her daughter Hannah (Whitman) Heyde. According to her firmly dated
       letter to Walt Whitman, she had
      requested a pickup of Hannah's package by Westcott's Express Tuesday the
      previous week (July 12). If she prepared Hannah's box on the same day that she
      has the picture taken, this letter dates to July 12, 1870. Since Louisa, in her
       letter, lamented the difficulty
      of preparing the package for Hannah, it is unlikely that she would both seek to
      have her picture taken and on the same day (July 12) have the box sent to
      Hannah. Therefore, this letter is more likely to date to the preceding Tuesday,
      July 5, 1870.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00597_n5">2. No letters from Walt Whitman
      to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman between February 1869 and his July 27, 1870, return
      to Brooklyn are extant (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em>,
      ed. Edwin Haviland Miller [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77],
      2:78–2:101). Walt returned to Brooklyn briefly after his thumb became
      infected in late April or early May 1870, and he returned to Washington in
      mid-May (see his  letter to William D.
      O'Connor).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00597_n2">3. William S. Pendleton's
      photography studio was located at 297 Fulton Street at the corner of Johnson.
      The earliest advertisement for Pendleton at that location dates to early August
      1870 (see "Pendleton, Practical Photographer," <em>Brooklyn Daily
         Eagle</em>, August 6, 1870, 3), but the studio was open in October 1869
      ("For Sale—A Large Stove," <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>,
      October 29, 1869, 3). A <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/multimedia/image152.html">photograph of
         Walt Whitman</a> was taken at the same studio (see Ted Genoways and Ed
      Folsom, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/wwqr/pdf/anc.00953.pdf">"An
         Unpublished Early 1870s Photograph of Whitman,"</a>
      <em>Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</em> 23 [Summer 2005],
      59–60). For Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's photograph, see "Louisa Van Velsor

   <p id="duk.00556_n3">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George also took a position
      as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden, and he married Louisa Orr Haslam
      in spring 1871. For more information on George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]

   <p id="duk.00438_n4">5. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles L. Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter. Charles Heyde was
      infamous among the Whitmans for his often offensive letters and poor treatment
      of Hannah.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00575_n9">6. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early
      adulthood he worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s
      he began working for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed
      through the Civil War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in
      St. Louis and became a nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For
      more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<br><br>
      Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman (1836–1873) was the wife of Jeff
      Whitman. She and Jeff had two daughters, Manahatta "Hattie"
      (1860–1886) and Jessie Louisa "Sis" (b. 1863). In 1868, Mattie and her
      daughters moved to join Jeff after he had assumed the position of
      Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis in 1867. For more on Mattie, see
      the introduction to Randall H. Waldron, ed., <em>Mattie: The
         Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman</em> (New York: New York University
      Press, 1977), 1–26.<a href="#r6">[back]

   <p id="duk.00597_n13">7. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      and family were in St. Paul, Iowa, in early August 1870 and presumably departed
      St. Louis for Iowa some weeks earlier. The date of their departure is not known
      (see Walt Whitman's  letter to
      William D. O'Connor).<a href="#r7">[back]

   <p id="duk.00597_n11">8. The final three words
      appear in the right margin of the page. The book that Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman gave to Helen Price is not known.<br><br>
      Helen Price was the daughter of Abby and Edmund Price. Abby H. Price
      (1814–1878) was active in various social-reform movements. Her
      husband, Edmund, operated a pickle factory in Brooklyn, and and the couple
      had four children—Arthur, Helen, Emily, and Henry (who died in 1852,
      at 2 years of age). During the 1860s, Price and her family, especially
      daughter Helen, were friends with Walt Whitman and his mother. In 1860, the
      Price family began to save Walt's letters. Helen's reminiscences of Whitman
      were included in Richard Maurice Bucke's biography, <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and she printed for the
      first time some of Whitman's letters to her mother ("Letters of Walt Whitman
      to his Mother and an Old Friend," <em>Putnam's Monthly</em> 5
      [1908], 163–169).
