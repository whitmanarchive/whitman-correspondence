      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am sitting here in my room home, alone—it is snowing hard &amp; heavy
      outside, &amp; cold &amp; wintry as ever—there has not been one mild day here
      for the past three weeks—two thirds of the time spiteful and gusty
      wind &amp; clouds of dust—&amp; this with bitter cold—seems to me I have
      felt the cold more than for the last three winters—But I reckon I have said
      enough on this point—Pete I cannot write anything interesting to you as I do not go
      anywhere, nor see anything new.—I have attended to the bringing out the new
      edition of my book, but as the plates were all ready before, it is not much of a
      job—I am home every night (&amp; half the days also)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Tuesday noon</p>
   
   
   <p>I am afraid this letter is not destined to be very cheering—I was attacked last
      night with sore throat, pretty bad—still I made out this morning to worry down
      a fair breakfast—The weather has been so infernal—last evening toward sundown, begun
      the spitefulest wind &amp; cold I ever knew,—great clouds suddenly come up,
      inky black, &amp; all of a sudden snow fell so thick &amp; fast, it was like a dense
      fog,—so thick the hard wind didn't dissipate it in the least—This lasted
      about half an hour, &amp; was about the highest old weather exhibition I ever
      witnessed—snow fell two inches thick in 15 minutes
   </p>
   
   
   
   <p>Dear Pete, how are you getting along—how about Sailer<sup><a href="#loc.01523_n2" id="r1">1</a></sup> and
      the RR?—I suppose slow &amp; aggravating enough—by what you said in
      your last. Dear Pete, I don't think I shall stay here as long as I originally
      intended—I shall be back by or before the end of this month—I am
      writing these lines home in the Kitchen—mother is sitting in the rocking chair
      sewing something—&amp; Eddy is grinding some good coffee in a coffee
      mill—it smells good—(I have retreated to the Kitchen, for the hot
      fire—here now I am not like I am in Washington—you would laugh to see
      me hovering over the fire)—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—My darling son, you must keep a good heart—dont get discouraged—love to
      you, baby,—I enclose $10—&amp; can send you whatever you want—
   </p>

   <p></span><span class="handshift">A few minutes before 6 o'clock last night, as many
      were flocking to the ferries on their way home from business, a boisterous
      southwest wind sprang up, which, veering round toward the north, developed into
      a hurricane. In a few seconds the sky was hidden by dark clouds, from which a
      heavy snow fell, and was driven along furiously before the gale. The suddenness
      and the fury of the storm created the greatest excitement around the ferries,
      and the fog bells were at once set in motion, but even these only added to the
      bewilderment, as the wind was so strong and uncertain. The James Rumsey ferry
      boat, from Hoboken at 5:50 P.M., met the full force of the storm, through which
      it was steered by means of the compass, and succeeded after the second attempt
      in entering its slip at Barclay street, having done the trip in twenty-two
      minutes. The Jersey City and Desbrosses street boat was safely steered through
      the storm by the compass. Several of the boats waited in their slips fifteen or
      twenty minutes for the storm to abate. Toward 7 o'clock the snow ceased to fall,
      and the clouds gradually disappeared, but the wind continued boisterous
      throughout the night.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."
