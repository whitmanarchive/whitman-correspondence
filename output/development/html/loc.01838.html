      <br></br><br></br>Mr Walt Whitman—
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>1</p> 
   
   <p>It has vexed me that a letter I lately intended for you, was 
      
      ad.
      
      
      on the outside to you or "nearest friend" at Washington. The answer was (as I take
      it) kind and romantic or <u>poetical</u> enough to be from the most "electric" and <u>beneficent</u> poet I have ever read after [illegible] copy of the "Graphic" of [
      <span class="unclear">Nov. 73?</span>]
      , with engraving of that <u>worshipful face</u>, with some writer's estimation of your works, and the publisher's remarks—this much
      marked with pencil <u>"laid up, lame and unfit
         
         
         
         
         for work at Camden N.J."</u></p>
   
   <p>2</p>
   
   <p>This I suppose that "nearest friend" or yourself intended as answer to my inquiry
      whether you were reduced to "distress", (pecuniary,) as the paper "Hearth and Home"
      about last of July hinted, by discharge from government employment. I thought "is
      it possible that this wonderful and all-deserving man's profits from his literary
      work will not support him in comfort?"
   </p>
   
   <p>Also I thought if your work was too <u>great</u> and <u>good</u> for a shallow world to appreciate and <u>begin</u> to pay for, I should ☞ 
      
      
      <p>from me, all my money except a 10 ct [

   <p><u>Walt</u>! I am a poor man, and myself, wife, and six children, live on an income of about
      <u>three hundred rarely approaching 400 dollars a year</u>, about half made by our labor in the cotton field, and pay <u>one fifth</u> for state and county <u>Taxes</u>; also I do not believe in "immortality" except <u>for you</u>, was once (by inheritance) a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful "patriarch", carried a gun in the Rebellion, and was <u>promoted</u> for the daring courage which <u>conscious integrity</u> gave, to the "stretches" service, but if you—<u>Walt</u>—are

      about to "go down", I say "by God" you <u>shall not</u> without an effort on my part to make it some easier. I have written a good deal of
      <u>droll</u>, <u>amusing rhymes</u>—not published. But "rhymers pass away" (as I want them to do)—I think I can sell
      books for you—giving you all the profits—as I am a most eloquent reader, and could
      "<u>canvass well</u>. But if your need is <u>urgent</u>, real, and <u>immediate</u>, I can spare you something of the small <u>store</u> of <u>capital</u> that is <u>helping me</u> in

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Newton Johnson
      (1832–1904) was a colorful and eccentric self-styled philosopher from
      rural Alabama. There are about thirty letters from Johnson in the Charles E.
      Feinberg Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919 (Library of
      Congress, Washington, D.C.), but unfortunately there are no replies extant,
      although Whitman wrote frequently for a period of approximately fifteen years.
      When Johnson wrote for the first time on , he was forty-two, "gray as a rat," as he would say in another
      letter from : a former Rebel
      soldier with an income between $300 and $400 annually, though before the
      war he had been "a <u>slaveholding</u> youthful 'patriarch.'"
      He informed Whitman in the , letter
      that during the past summer he had bought <em>Leaves of Grass</em>
      and, after a momentary suspicion that the bookseller should be "<u>hung for swindling</u>," he discovered the mystery of
      Whitman's verse, and "I assure you I was soon 'cavorting' round and asserting
      that the $3 book was worth $50 if it could not be replaced, (Now
      Laugh)." He offered either to sell Whitman's poetry and turn over to him all
      profits or to lend him money. On ,
      after describing Guntersville, Alabama, a town near his farm from which he often
      mailed his letters to Whitman, he commented: "<u>Orthodoxy</u> flourishes with the usual <u>lack</u> of
      <u>flowers</u> or <u>fruit</u>." See
      also Charles N. Elliot, <em>Walt Whitman as Man, Poet and
         Friend</em> (Boston: R. G. Badger, 1915), 125–130.
