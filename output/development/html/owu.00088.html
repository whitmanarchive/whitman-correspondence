      <br></br><br></br>Dear Alma Johnston &amp; John &amp; all the girls &amp; children big &amp; little
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A word at any rate to show I think of you (as I often do &amp; deeply)—Am here yet in
      much the same condition as the last year—good spirits (sort o') but physically
      disabled almost utterly—Fine sunny days I get out in my wheel chair for an hour or
      two—generally however am anchored here in my big ratan chair with the wolf-skin
      spread over the back—have two daily good curryings (massages) &amp; appetite &amp; sleep
      continuing fairly—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Alma, I suppose you rec'd the little ed'n of L of G. I sent—</p>

      Love to you all—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John H. (J.H.) Johnston
      (1837–1919) was a New York jeweler who became a close friend of Whitman's.
      Whitman visited Johnston's home, and Johnston assisted with raising funds for
      the aging poet. Alma Calder Johnston was an author and John's second wife. Her
      family owned a home and property in Equinunk, Pennsylvania. For more on the
      Johnstons, see Susan L. Roberson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_98.html">Johnston, John H. (1837–1919) and Alma Calder</a>" (<em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and
      Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
