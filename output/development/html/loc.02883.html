      <br></br><br></br>My dearest Friend
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Your letter came to me just when I most needed the comfort of it—when I was
      watching and tending my dear Mother as she gently, slowly, with but little
      suffering, sank to rest. There was no sick bed to sit by.—We got her up and
      out into the air and sunshine for an hour or two even the day before she
      died—No  disease,
      only the stomach could not do its work any longer &amp; for the last three weeks she
      lived wholly on stimulants, suffering somewhat from sickness. She drew her last
      breath very gently, before daybreak on the 15th
      inst.,
      in her 90th year, which she had entered in 
      Jan
      
      . She looked very beautiful in death, notwithstanding her great
      age—as well she might—tranquil sunset that it was of a beautiful
      day—a fulfilled life—joy &amp; delight of her father in youth (who used
      to call her the apple of his eye) good wife, devoted, self-sacrificing, wise mother—patient,
      courageous sufferer through thirty years of chronic rheumatism (which, however,
      neutralized &amp; ceased its pains the last few years) unsurpassed &amp; indeed I
      think unsurpassable, in conscientiousness—in the strong sense of duty &amp;
      perfect obedience to that highest sense—she is one of those who amply justify
      your large faith in women. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not need to tell you anything my dearest friend—you know all—I feel
      your strong comforting hand—I press it very close.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had all my children with me at the funeral—  O the comfort your dear letter was &amp;
      is to me. Thinking over &amp; over the few words you say of yourself—&amp;
      what is said in the paper (so eagerly read—every word so welcome) I cannot
      help fancying that the return of the distressing sensations in the head must be
      caused by your having worked at the book—the "Two Rivulets" (I dearly [
      <span class="unclear">like?</span>]
       the title &amp; the idea
      of bringing the Poems &amp; Prose together so)—that you must be more patient
      with yourself and submit still to perfect rest—&amp; that perhaps in regard to
      the stomach—you have not enough adapted your diet to the privation of
      exercise—that you must be more indulgent to the stomach too in the sense of
      giving it only the very easiest &amp; simplest work to do.
   </p>

      Your own loving
      <br></br>Annie.

   <p> My children join their love with mine.</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
