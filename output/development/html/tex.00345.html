       the

       money order, &amp; the money (£4—$21.97) has been paid me—for which
      accept warmest thanks.—No letter has yet reached me, specifying an order for my books,
      new edition—but if one does not come in a few days, I believe I will send the Two
      Vols. to same address as this note—As, I take it, that will be agreeable to you. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am middling comfortable these times—Again thanks—</p>

   <p id="tex.00345_n2">2. Like many other young disillusioned
      Englishmen, Carpenter (1844–1929) deemed Walt Whitman a prophetic
      spokesman of an ideal state cemented in the bonds of brotherhood. On , he wrote for the first time to Walt
      Whitman: "Because you have, as it were, given me a ground for the love of men I
      thank you continually in my heart. . . . For you have made men to be not ashamed
      of the noblest instinct of their nature." On , Carpenter sent another impassioned letter. On , he sent £4 for the 1876 volumes. See
      also Whitman's  letter to Anne
      Gilchrist.<a href="#r2">[back]
