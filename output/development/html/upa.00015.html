   <p>I must write you a few lines, dear loving friend, once
      more at any rate. Since I last wrote clouds have darkened over me, &amp; still
      remain. On the night of 23d of January last I was paralyzed, left side, &amp; have
      remained so since. February 19th I lost a dear sister, who died in St. Louis,
      leaving two young daughters. May 23d my inexpressibly
      beloved mother died in Camden. I was just able to get from Washington to her dying
      bed, &amp; sit there. I thought I was bearing all stoutly, but I find it affecting
      the progress of my recovery since, &amp; now. The doctor says my disease is really
      cerebral anaemia, resulting in paralysis. I am still feeble, palsied, &amp; have
      spells of great distress in the head— But there are favorable points—I
      am up &amp; dressed every day, sleep &amp; eat middling well, &amp; do not change
      much yet in flesh &amp; face, only look very old, (though that is nothing new.)
      Though I move slowly very short distances, I walk with difficulty, &amp; have to
      remain in or near the house. I think the probabilities are quite strong yet that I
      shall get well, (though I may not.) 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Many times during the past year, especially during the past  six months, have I thought of you
      &amp; your children—Many times indeed have I been going to write, but did not.
      I have just been reading over again several of this &amp; last year's letters from
      you, &amp; looking at the pictures sent in the one of January 24, '72. The letters
      of Jan 24, June 3, &amp; July 11, of '72,<sup><a href="#upa.00015_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &amp; of Jan
      31 &amp; May 20, this year<sup><a href="#upa.00015_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> —with certainly one
      other, &amp; may-be two— all came safe. Do not think hard of me for not
      writing oftener, especially the last seven months— If you could look into my
      spirit &amp; emotions you would be entirely satisfied &amp; at peace. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am at present temporarily here at Camden, on the Delaware river, immediately
      opposite Philadelphia, at the house of my brother. I am occupying the rooms where
      my
      mother died— every object of furniture &amp;c. is familiar &amp; has an
      emotional history. You must not be unhappy about me, for I am as comfortably
      situated as can be—And many things— indeed every thing—in my case
      might be so much worse. Though my plans depend on yet uncertain results, my
      intention, as far as any thing, is, on getting stronger, &amp; after the hot season
      passes, to get back to Washington for the fall &amp; winter. My post office address
      continues there, (Solicitor's Office Treasury.) I send my love to Percy, &amp; all
      your dear children. The enclosed ring I have just taken from my finger &amp; send
      you with my love.<sup><a href="#upa.00015_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Anne Burrows Gilchrist
      (1828–1885) was the author of one of the first significant pieces of
      criticism on <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, titled "A Woman's Estimate
      of Walt Whitman (From Late Letters by an English Lady to W. M. Rossetti)," <em>Radical</em> 7 (May 1870), 345–59. Gilchrist's long
      correspondence with Whitman indicates that she had fallen in love with the poet
      after reading his work; when the pair met in 1876 when she moved to
      Philadelphia, Whitman never fully returned her affection, although their
      friendship deepened after that meeting. For more information on their
      relationship, see Marion Walker Alcaro, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_79.html">Gilchrist, Anne Burrows (1828–1885)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).

      the notes to Whitman's .<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00015_n2">2.  On , Anne Gilchrist complained of
      Whitman's ten-month silence, and begged him to write: "&amp; do not fear that I
      shall take it to mean anything it doesn't mean." But, she assured Whitman, she
      was willing to serve "a long long novitiate" (The Library of Congress; Thomas B.
      Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt
         Whitman</em> (1918), 86–87). On , she sent birthday greetings: "What can I tell you but the same
      old story of a heart fast-anchored— of a soul to whom your soul is as the
      Sun &amp; the fresh sweet air, and the nourishing sustaining earth wherein the
      other one breathes free &amp; feeds &amp; expands &amp; delights itself. There
      is no occupation of the day however homely that is not coloured, elevated, made
      more cheerful to me by thought of you &amp; by thoughts you have given me blent
      in &amp; suffusing all" (The Library of Congress; Thomas B. Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em> (1918),
      88–89). Writing at almost the same time as Walt Whitman, on , Gilchrist, moved by newspaper
      reports of his continued illness, addressed him as "My Darling" (The Library of
      Congress; Thomas B. Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist
         and Walt Whitman</em> (1918), 91–93). Fearful that Walt Whitman would
      not receive this twelve-page letter, she sent one to Washington and another to
      Camden.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="upa.00015_n3">3.  Ecstatically Gilchrist
      replied on : "O the precious
      letter, bearing to me the living touch of your hand, vibrating through &amp;
      through me as I feel the pressure of the ring that pressed your flesh &amp; now
      will press mine so long as I draw breath" (The Library of Congress; Thomas B.
      Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt
         Whitman</em> (1918), 96). Although Walt Whitman did not write again until
      1875, he sent Gilchrist newspapers and magazines. On  (The Library of Congress; Thomas B. Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em> (1918),
      98–101) she wrote about her children; and on  she said of his health: "Perhaps if my hand were in
      yours, dear Walt, you would get along faster. Dearer and sweeter that lot than
      even to have been your bride in the full flush &amp; strength and glory of your
      youth. I turn my face to the westward sky and before I lie down to sleep, deep
      &amp; steadfast within me the silent aspiration that every year, every month
      &amp; week may help something to prepare and make fitter me and mine to be your
      comfort and joy" (The Library of Congress; Thomas B. Harned, ed., <em>The Letters of Anne Gilchrist and Walt Whitman</em> (1918),
      103).<a href="#r3">[back]
