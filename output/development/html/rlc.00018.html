      <br></br><br></br>My dear Rudolf Schmidt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Yours of Nov: 27 
      rec'd. Console yourself for suffering 
      f'm
      
       rheumatism—for it
      might be paralysis—I still keep around—am much more comfortable than
      four years ago, but am very lame &amp; clumsy, (yet red and stout)—
   </p>
   
   <p>Bjornson<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> did not come to see me—America you know is
      a big country, &amp; he had many places to go to—I think Clemens Petersen<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> is still some where in this country—very likely
      doing well—the last time I saw him he came up to me (personally looked well)
      in New York, between two &amp; three years ago, in a crowd, &amp; only a few
      words—he is a quite well known literary person &amp; if he had died or any
      thing happened, I should have heard of it—
   </p>
   
   <p>I too mourn the death of Elster<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—though unknown I
      had formed a liking for him—I shall forward one of my books to
      Thorsteinsson<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Dr Bucke's book<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> will not be published for some months—perhaps a
      year—I send you, same mail with this, a copy of my new edition<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup>—
   </p>
   
   <p>As I write it is Sunday, just before sunset—&amp; we have had a fine
      day—indeed a fine mild winter so far—have been in my room all day,
      writing &amp;c, very comfortable—shall now walk to the post office, &amp;
      probably sail once or twice across the river, the Delaware here, a mile
      wide—
   </p>
   
   <p>The London publisher &amp; agent for my new edition is David Bogue, St Martin's
      Place, Trafalgar Square—
   </p>
   
   <p>I have heard that my book is to be translated into German, by some friends in
      Dresden<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>—also into Russian by some Russian
      exiles &amp; a Mr Lee a Russ-English scholar<sup><a href="#rlc.00018_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup>—I
      have been written to about both propositions &amp; of course have expressed warmest
      assent—So good bye, my dear friend—&amp; affectionate wishes to you
      &amp; yours—
