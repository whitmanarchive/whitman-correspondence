      <br></br><br></br>Dear son,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I received yours of the 9th—and was right glad to hear from you, and to get such an
      affectionate letter. We have had gay times here this week, with what they call the
      "Carnival"<sup><a href="#n0140" id="r2">2</a></sup>—it continued two days &amp; nights. The nights were
      the best. Every thing was lit up, and it was like a scene of enchantment. The crowds
      of
      spectators were countless. Hundreds and even thousands mixed in, the second afternoon
      &amp;
      night in fancy dresses, or wore masks—&amp; went around having fun. Lots of women were
      out, some of them as full of sport as the men—The principal street here is very wide,
      I should think three times as wide as Broadway. This was the scene of operations.
      All the
      vehicles were turned off, then at certain hours let on again for a while, for driving
      &amp;
      races—there were some splendid horses—Less drinking than you would have
      supposed—No musses, &amp; no accidents. I send you a paper. Last night however was a
      murder, a man I knew well by sight, a gambler called "Sonny James"<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> was killed. 
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With me all goes about the same. I work about 6 hours every day, mostly writing—am
      well &amp; hearty, travel around out doors quite a good deal—&amp; keep up a cheerful
      heart.<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> Johnny,<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> you say you should
      like to see me—Well, no more than I should to see you, my darling<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> boy. I wish we were together this minute, &amp; you had employment
      so we could remain with each other, if you would feel satisfied to be so.<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Have<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> you got work of any kind there in Brooklyn? Write to me,
      Jack,<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> &amp; let me know all particulars.<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> Love to you, dear son,<sup><a href="#loc.01596_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup> &amp; good
      bye for this time.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>John Flood was a streetcar conductor in New York,
      known, according to an unidentified notation on his letter to Walt Whitman, as
      "Broadway Jack." According to date entries in an address book (the Library of
      Congress # 109), Whitman saw Flood on September 30, 1868, and October 5, 1868,
      and rode with him on his Second Avenue car. Flood had been a conductor for ten
      years. After Whitman's return to Washington, there was a brief correspondence,
      consisting of four extant letters from Whitman (dated , ,
      , and ) and one from the young man. Flood wrote on : "Sir, It is with great pleasure
      that I sit down with pen in hand to address a few lines to you." He informed
      Walt Whitman that he had lost his position on New Year's Eve and that he was now
      seeking another job: "I shall still continue to correspond and can never forget
      your kind friendship towards me. ... Your True and Ever intimate friend."
      According to the first listing of his name in the New York Directory, in
      1872–1873, he was at that time either in the milk business or a
      milkman.
