      <br></br><br></br>Dear John Burroughs,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I rec'd your letter, &amp; was glad to hear from you—I am still in a pretty bad way—I
      am writing this over at the office, at my desk, but feel to-day more like laying 
      down than sitting up—I do not walk any better, &amp; my head has frequent distress—Still,
      for all that I slowly gain strength—very slowly—&amp; <em>shall yet get well as ever</em>—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Every thing goes on about the same, in the sphere of my affairs, &amp;c. as when I last
      saw you—Mother is at Camden—mopes &amp; worries a good deal about me—I don't feel like
      leaving here, 
      for visiting or any purpose, until I get so I can move about—The doctor is applying
      electricity, every other day—I have had it now five or six times—I anticipate benefit,
      in a while, but it makes no perceptible difference yet—How and where is 'Sula? I wish
      I was where I could come in &amp; see her &amp; you often—(those nice breakfasts were bright
      spots, &amp; I shall not forget them)—if I could just get 'round and sit an hour or so
      for a change, &amp; chat with 'Sula and you, 
      two or three times a week, I believe it would do me good—but I must take 
      it out in imagination—for it is impossible in reality—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I got a long letter from Dowden<sup><a href="#loc.01715_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—he mentions you—As I sit I look over from my office window on the President's grounds—the
      grass is green enough—they have already been over it once with the cutter, 
      &amp; Saturday there were men out there in their shirt-sleeves raking it up—I have a big
      bunch of lilacs in a pitcher in my room—Washington looks about the same—rather cool
      &amp; cloudy to-day—but pleasant weather may-be by the time you receive this—best love
      to you &amp; 'Sula<sup><a href="#loc.01715_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—
   </p>
