      <br></br><br></br>W. M. Rossetti:
      <br></br>Dear Sir &amp; friend;
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Please accept these copies of my latest edition. Please have conveyed to <em>the lady</em><sup><a href="#yal.00397_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> the set enclosed for her. John Burroughs
      sends second edition of his "Notes"<sup><a href="#yal.00397_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—Your letter of 8th July<sup><a href="#yal.00397_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> has
      reached me—I hope to write you more fully &amp; answer it from Washington
      city—My address is still there—(&amp; always, always glad to hear from
      you, my friend.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I am still blest with the greatest health, &amp; have been enjoying this fine summer
      here exceedingly. My "<em>Leaves of Grass</em>" I consider
      substantially finished, as in the copies I send you. To 
      "<em>Democratic Vistas</em>" it is my plan to add much, if I live. I have read
      carefully the article in the <em>Westminster</em><sup><a href="#yal.00397_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> If you learn for certain who wrote it, I
      should be glad to know—It is a profound &amp; eloquent essay—&amp; I am
      proud to be the subject of it—I have received much comfort from your
      country—<em>here</em> little but refusal or coldness.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I conclude by sending best respects &amp; love. Indeed, my friend, I wish to hear
      from you oftener.<sup><a href="#yal.00397_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup>
