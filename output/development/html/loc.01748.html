   <p>Pete, dear son, I am not sinking nor getting worse—I have had some <u>very</u> bad times, 
      &amp; have some pretty bad ones yet, mostly with my head—&amp; my leg is about 
      as useless as ever—still I am decidedly no worse, &amp; I think now I am even <u>getting better</u>—it is slow, &amp; with great alternations—but I have the feeling of getting more strength,
      
      &amp; easier in the head, more like myself—something like what I was before mother's death—I
      cannot be reconciled to that yet—it is the great 
      
      
      cloud of my life—nothing that ever 
      happened before has had such an effect on me—but I shall get well, yet, dear son,
      
      probably, (of course not certainly) and be back in Washington this fall, 
      &amp; we will be together again. I think I am now about as I was the day 
      you came down to Baltimore depot with me, 20th May I think
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Friday after dinner
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I have thought of you the nights of this week, the heaviest rains here almost ever
      known,—great trouble &amp; loss to railroads—was you in any tight spot?—that described 
      in your last made me feel a little nervous—That was a fearful 
      disaster of the Wawasset<sup><a href="#loc.01748_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—sad beyond description—
   </p>
   
   
   <p>So Tasistro is around yet—The Chronicle came—Mr. Eldridge has returned to Washington
      
      from his month's leave—he stopt here and paid me a 3 or 4 hours visit—John Burroughs has an article in the Sept. number of Scribner's Magazine,<sup><a href="#loc.01748_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> just out, in which I am extracted from—Pete, it is now towards 3, and I am going
      to try 
      to 
      
      
      get down to the ferry boat, &amp; cross to Philadelphia—so you see I am not 
      altogether disabled—but it is awful tough work—when the weather is cooler, 
      (which will be soon) I shall be better off in Washington, as it is very lonesome to
      me here, 
      &amp; no one to convoy me—I shall return there—I want to get a couple of unfurnished rooms,
      
      or top floor, somewhere on or near the car route—Pete if you see Charley Toner,<sup><a href="#loc.01748_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> give him my love, &amp; ask him to give you his address to send me—He works in the Printing
      Bureau (M'Cartee's)<sup><a href="#loc.01748_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Treasury.

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.01748_n1">1. One of the executors,
      probably Richard Maurice Bucke, dated this letter "Aug 28, 1873." However, the
      reference to Eldridge in this letter would seem to be earlier than that in the
      letter of . The probabilities are also
      that Whitman would have referred to the "Wawasset" disaster shortly after it
      occurred on August 8, though the investigation lasted from August 18 to
      23.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01748_n2">2. The "Wawasset" was a
      river steamer which caught fire on August 8 on the Potomac River near Aquia
      Creek, with a frightful loss of life. The official investigation attributed the
      tragedy to dereliction of duty.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01748_n3">3. "The Birds of the Poet,"
      <em>Scribner's Monthly</em> 6 (1873), 565–574, in which
      Burroughs quoted at length from "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.01748_n4">4. Towner (as Whitman meant
      to write) was a clerk in the Treasury Department; see Whitman's letter to Doyle
      of . At one time Whitman wanted
      to lodge with the Towners.<a href="#r4">[back]
