      <br></br><br></br>Dear Walt Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I intended to call over &amp; see you yesterday when I was in Philadelphia, but I
      was unexpectedly detained by one man and forced to go to Washington so as to reach
      here last night. 
   </p>
   
   <p> I will call on you on my way back to New York. </p>
   
   <p> But I write now to tell you why, because my visit will be on business </p>
   
   <p> I believe you have never met Mr Rice,<sup><a href="#n6004" id="r1">1</a></sup> proprietor of the North American Review, 
      altho'
      
       nominaly he may have corresponded with you—that is, his office
      Editor may have written to you in his name, as he always does, even when Mr Rice is
      in Europe. It is at 
       Mr Rice's
      instance that I will call on you. 
   </p>
   
   <p> He has conceived the plan of procuring a collection of papers that, united in one
      volume, will be a permanent memorial of Lincoln. He has set about to secure the
      Reminiscences of <u>all</u> the eminent Americans who came into
      personal relations with him—each man to tell his story, whether it shall be
      short or long. 
   </p>
   
   <p> That's what he calls his <u>Lincoln Series</u>. Some of these
      papers he may publish in the North American Review, &amp; others in the North
      American Review Syndicate: a group of influential papers which he supplies &amp; that
      publish simultaneously articles from famous men whom ordinarily newspapers cannot
      reach—nor afford to pay separately even if they did reach them. All the
      articles that you see marked "Copyright" 
       in the New York
      Tribune or 
      Phil.
      
       Times (Sunday editions) are supplied by Mr Rice. 
   </p>
   
   <p>
      <u>Next</u>: he intends to secure a series of papers giving the
      civil history of the civil war—legislation, &amp;c. 
   </p>
   
   <p> He wants me to see you &amp; ask you to write a paper on your experiences of the
      Civil War—the hospital life, &amp; other phases that you witnessed &amp; have
      not yet described. 
   </p>
   
   <p> Could you write an article giving your recollections of Lincoln and also your
      memories of the War? Short or long it will be gladly accepted &amp; <u>liberaly</u> paid for. He will take it, whether it is a page
      or a hundred pages 
   </p>
   
   <p> I shall be here a week. I suppose I shall have no difficulty in finding the good
      grey poet in Camden. 
   </p>

      Ever truly yours,

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>James Redpath (1833–1891),
      an antislavery activist, journalist, and longtime friend of Whitman, was the
      author of <em>The Public Life of Capt. John Brown</em> (Boston:
      Thayer and Eldridge, 1860), a correspondent for the <em>New York
         Tribune</em> during the war, and the originator of the "Lyceum" lectures. He
      met Whitman in Boston in 1860 and remained an enthusiastic admirer; see Horace
      Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906–1996), 9
      vols., 3:459–461. He concluded his first letter to Whitman on : "I love you, Walt! A conquering
      Brigade will ere long march to the music of your barbaric jawp." Redpath became
      editor of <em>The North American Review</em> in November 1886. See
      also Charles F. Horner, <em>The Life of James Redpath and the
         Development of the Modern Lyceum</em> (New York: Barse &amp; Hopkins, 1926);

         Making of Nineteenth-Century America</em> (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
      Press, 2008); and J.R. LeMaster, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_46.html">Redpath, James [1833–1891]</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
