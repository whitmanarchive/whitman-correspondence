      <br></br><br></br>Dearest mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>A letter from Jeff came this morning<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—mother, I was sorry to hear you had a return of your rheumatism—I do hope you will
      favor yourself more, it depends so much on that—&amp; rheumatism is so obstinate, when
      it gets hold of one.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, you rec'd a letter from me, sent last Wednesday, 22d.<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> of course, with a small quantity of shinplasters. Next time you or Jeff writes, I
      wish you would tell me whether the letters come pretty regularly, <em>the next morning after I write them</em>—this now ought to reach you Wednesday forenoon, April 29th. Mother, did a Mr. Howell
      call on you?—he was here last week to see about his boy, died a long while ago in
      hospital in Yorktown. He works in the Navy Yard—knows Andrew. You will see about him,
      (the boy,) in a letter I sent yesterday to the Eagle—it ought to appear to-day or to-morrow.<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Jeff, I wish you would take 10 cts I send in this letter &amp; get me ten copies of the
      Eagle with it in—put in 5 more of my pictures, (the big ones in last edition "Leaves"),
      &amp; a couple of the photographs carte visites (the smaller ones,) &amp; send me to the same
      direction as before. Jeff, I wish you would do up the parcel same as before, it came
      very well. I will send an Eagle to Han and George. The stamps &amp; 10 cts. are for Jeff,
      for the papers, &amp; postage.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written to Han, &amp; sent her George's last two letters from Kentucky, one I got
      last week from Mount Sterling. I write to George, &amp; send him papers. Sam Beatty<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> is here in Washington again, I saw him, &amp; he said he would write to George. Mother,
      I have not got any new clothes yet, but shall very soon I hope. People are more rough
      and free &amp; easy drest than your way. Then it is dusty or muddy most of the time here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother dear, I hope you have comfortable times—at least as comfortable as the law
      allows—I am so glad you are not going to have the trouble of moving this 1st of May.
      How are the Browns?<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> Tell Will I should like to see him first rate—if he was here, attached to the suite
      of some big officer, or something of that kind, he would have a good time &amp; do well.
      I see lots of young fellows not half as capable &amp; trustworthy as he, coming &amp; going,
      in Washington, in such positions. The big generals &amp; head men, all through the armies,
      &amp; provosts &amp;c like to have a squad of such smart nimble young men around them. Give
      my respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Brown.
   </p>
   
   <p>Tell Jeff I am going to write to Mr. Lane, either to-day or to-morrow.<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> Jeff asks me if I go to hospitals as much as ever. If my letters home don't show
      it, you don't get 'em. I feel sorry sometimes after I have sent them, I have said
      so much about hospitals, &amp; so mournful. O mother, the young man in Armory Square,
      Dennis Barrett,<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> in the 169th N. Y., I mentioned before, is probably going to get up after all—he is like one saved from the grave. Saturday last I saw him &amp; talked with
      him &amp; gave him something to eat, &amp; he was much better—it is the most unexpected recovery
      I have yet seen.
   </p>
   
   <p>Mother, I see Jeff says in the letter you don't hear from me very often—I will write
      oftener especially to Jeff. Dear brother, I hope you are getting along good &amp; in good
      spirits. You must not mind the failure of the sewer bills, &amp;c. &amp;c.<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> It don't seem to me it makes so much difference about worldly successes (beyond just
      enough to eat &amp; drink, and shelter, in the moderatest limits) any more, since the
      last four months of my life especially, &amp; that merely to <em>live</em>, &amp; have one fair meal a day, is <em>enough</em>—but then you have a family, &amp; that makes a difference.
   </p>
   
   <p>Matty, I send you my best love, dear sister—how I wish I could be with you one or
      two good days. Mat, do you remember the good time we had that awful stormy night we
      went to the opera, New York, &amp; had the front seat, &amp; heard the handsome-mouthed Guerrabella?<sup><a href="#loc.00767_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> And then the good oyster supper at Fulton Market—("pewter them ales"—) O, Mat, I
      hope &amp; trust we shall have such times again.
   </p> 
   
   <p>Tell Andrew he must remember what I wrote about the throat, &amp;c. I am sure he will
      get all right before long, &amp; recover his voice. Give him my love—&amp; tell Mannahatta
      her Uncle Walt is living now among the sick soldiers. Jeff, look out for the Eagles,
      &amp; send the portraits. Dearest mother, I must bid you &amp; all for the present good bye.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00767_n1">1. In his , letter to Walt Jeff wrote: "Mother
      had a little attack of her rheumatism yesterday and to-day and I am somewhat
      afraid that she will have more of it. She has been wonderful foolish in cleaning
      house as she calls it and has overworked herself. I dont think that she ought to
      do so, and so I tell her but she always answers that it's got to be done and
      that there is no one but her to do it,
      &amp;c."<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n2">2. This letter is not
      known.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n3">3. Apparently this letter
      did not appear in the <em>Brooklyn Daily Eagle</em>, as Whitman
      acknowledged in a letter from . He
      probably submitted it to the <em>Brooklyn Daily Union</em>, in
      which appeared a letter, dated September 21, 1863, and printed on September 22,
      1863, describing "Benjamin D. Howell, Company D, 87th New York, Aged 18." The
      son of Henry D. Howell, who was employed, like Walt's brother Andrew, in the
      Navy Yard, died at Yorktown in June 1862. Howell went to Washington in the
      following spring "to see if he could get any certainty about the boy." See Emory
      Holloway, ed., <em>The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of Walt
         Whitman</em> (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, Page &amp; Co., 1921),
      2:28–29; and Charles I. Glicksberg, ed., <em>Walt Whitman
         and the Civil War</em> (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,
      1933), 133 and <em>n</em>.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n4">4. Samuel A. Beatty lived at
      40 Prince Street, Brooklyn, New York. According to the Directories of
      1850–51 and 1856–57 he was a shoemaker; later he was listed as a
      "gasfitter" or "gas regulator." His name did not appear in the Directory of
      1865–66.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n5">5. See Whitman's letter from
      
      . The son, William A.
      Brown, was listed in the Directory of 1865–66 as a bookkeeper.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n6">6. Moses Lane was chief
      engineer in the Brooklyn Water Works. Like Jeff, he collected money from his
      employees and friends. Lane sent Whitman various sums which he acknowledged in
      letters. In his letter of , Lane
      pledged $5 each month. In an unpublished manuscript in the Berg Collection,
      Whitman wrote, obviously for publication: "I have distributed quite a large sum
      of money, contributed for that purpose by noble persons in Brooklyn, New York,
      (chiefly through Moses Lane, Chief Engineer, Water Works there.)" Lane assisted
      Whitman in other ways. He was so solicitous of Whitman's personal welfare that
      on , he sent through Jeff $5 "for
      your own especial benefit. According to a letter written by Lane on April 30,
      1863 (The Library of Congress), Whitman wrote to him on the twenty-ninth. Lane
      promised to "make an effort among my friends here to keep you supplied with
      funds all summer."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n7">7. Dennis Barrett (or
      Barret) was a member of the Hundred and Sixty-ninth New York Volunteers. (The
      editors of the <em>Complete Works</em> assume, doubtfully, that
      Barrett is referred to in a letter from 
      . According to
      Glicksberg's <em>Walt Whitman and the Civil War</em>, Whitman
      wrote to Barrett on April 18, 1863; similarly, it seems more likely that Whitman
      wrote about Barrett for the first time in the apparently lost letter of April
      22, 1863 (Glicksberg, 132).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n8">8. In a letter to Walt dated
      , Jeff complained, "We dont hear
      from you as often as we used to," and described the defeat of a bill in the
      state legislature which would have empowered the Brooklyn Sewer Commission to
      construct a sewer. Since Jeff was to have been in charge of the project, he had
      "had quite a disappointment in a small way."<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00767_n9">9. Genevra Guerrabella, who
      was a New York girl named Genevieve Ward, made her operatic debut in Paris in
      1859. Her acting was unusually effective (for the operatic stage) in such roles
      as Violetta, Leonora, and Elvira. She evidently appeared for the first time in
      New York on November 10, 1862.<a href="#r9">[back]
