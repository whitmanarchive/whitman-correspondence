      <br></br><br></br>Dearest friend,
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I like with all my heart (&amp; head too) "A memorandum at a venture". It is as clear
      as daylight to me that you speak truth—invigorating ennobling truth, full of hope
      &amp; promise &amp; impetus for the race. I have never for a moment wavered in my belief in
      this truth since it burst upon me a veritable
      
      
      
      sunrise in reading your poems in 1869—each part of those poems necessary to the whole—It
      would indeed be betraying a great cause a sacred trust to cancel what is now once
      more attacked.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I cannot think the smallest harm of any kind, even pecuniary, (except to the men themselves
      who thus expose the nature of their thoughts)—will come of it. I do not think you
      will sell one less copy, &amp; I suppose you will have a larger
      
      
      
      share of the profits. I am very glad you have written these clear strong words for
      the North American.
   </p>
   
   <p>A real pleasure it is to see John Burroughs—both for your sake—for it seems in a kind
      of way almost like seeing you—&amp; for his own. What eyes he has for the ways of the
      whole dumb world. He has gone just now to my favorite Haslemere, in quest of nightingales—&amp;
      I hope
      
      
      
      will make the acquaintance of an excellent friend of mine there to whom I gave an
      introduction Unluckily Herby is away—painting some portraits in Monmouthshire with
      which he has succeeded well. He has also sold his Academy picture—&amp; will be back in
      time to see John Burroughs on his way thro' [illegible]. Ah if you had but come with him! Best love from Giddy &amp; I.
   </p>
