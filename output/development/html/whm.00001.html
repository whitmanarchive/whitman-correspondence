      <br></br><br></br>My dear Sir
      
   </p> 
   
   <p>First begging your pardon &amp; hoping "I dont intrude" (yet knowing I do)—I am
      writing for the magazine market—or rather have written—a reminiscence of
      the actors &amp; plays &amp; "the old Bowery" of my youthful days—the chief
      figure in it being your father—by far the greatest histrion I have ever seen
      in my life (&amp; I have always been a theatre goer)—
   </p>
   
   <p>What I write to you now for, I want a good characteristic portrait of your father
      either in citizen's costume, or, (if <em>very good</em>) in one of his
      dramatic characters, to wood-engrave an illustration from—say to make a
      picture to fill ab't the size of one of the Harper's Magazine pages. Can you help me
      to it?<sup><a href="#whm.00001_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> 
   </p>
   
   <p>I am disabled coop'd up here, &amp; can't get about to get things for myself—or
      I wouldn't trouble you—
   </p>
   
   <p>Won't you allow me to send you an autograph copy of my "Leaves of Grass" as a nibble
      at recompense?
   </p>

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="whm.00001_n1">1. Booth wrote to Whitman on
       and  and sent a copy of Asia Booth Clarke's <em>The Elder
         and the Younger Booth</em> (1882), "containing," in Booth's words, "poor
      copies of the good portraits that are in some secure, forgotten place among my
      'traps.'" Whitman's article, entitled "Booth and 'The Bowery,'" appeared in the
      New York <em>Tribune</em> on August 16, 1885 (see the letter from
      Whitman to James Redpath of ).<a href="#r1">[back]
