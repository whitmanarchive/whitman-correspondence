      <br></br><br></br>Dearest Mother,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>I only write again this week (I wrote last Tuesday) to inform you that the Attorney
      General has promoted me. I have now a real good berth, what they call a third class
      clerk with the pay of $1600 a year.<sup><a href="#prc.00006_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> I shall have about $127 a month (they take a little off, every time they pay, on
      acc't of gov't tax.) Besides I have now a regular appointment, instead of being a
      temporary clerk, as before. I was appointed last Wednesday, my new grade &amp; pay commence
      on Nov. 1st—I haven't got a letter from home for ten or twelve days. The Attorney
      General has gone to New York—he is badly afflicted with sore eyes, &amp; has gone there
      to see the best oculists—
   </p>
   
   <p>My cold, or whatever it is, is better to-day—I hope you are all well—Good bye, dear
      mother. <em>Write soon</em>.
   </p>
   
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="closer">
      <br></br>Walt.
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mother, I send some envelopes—You must have paper—you know I left you a great lot,
      when I was home. I hope you are not sick, dear mother.
   </p>
