   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>David McKay (1860–1918) took
      over Philadelphia-based publisher Rees Welsh's bookselling and publishing
      businesses in 1881–2. McKay and Rees Welsh published the 1881 edition of
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em> after opposition from the Boston
      District Attorney prompted James R. Osgood &amp; Company of Boston, the
      publisher Whitman had originally contracted with for publication of the volume,
      to withdraw. McKay also went on to publish <em>Specimen Days &amp;
         Collect</em>, <em>November Boughs</em>, <em>Gems
         from Walt Whitman</em>, and <em>Complete Prose Works</em>. For
      more information about McKay, see Joel Myerson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_88.html">McKay, David (1860–1918)</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="med.00857_n1">1. Traubel writes:
      "Changed his cover design at McKay's [at] my suggestion. Instead of 'Walt
      Whitman's Complete Prose and Poems' above and specified contents
      below—author's edition, portraits, 1888-9—all that—he is
      satisfied to have 'Walt Whitman's Complete Works' at the top, 'Poetry and Prose'
      in centre, 'Author's Edition 1888-9' below" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.26.html">Monday, November 26, 1888</a>). The date of this note can be further
      verified by Whitman's  letter to his
      binder Frederick Oldach in which he writes: "<em>I will send you
         the label to put on the backs—I am now having them
         printed—</em>." Traubel noted: "W's design for the cover was given back to
      me by Oldach. I keep it among my records" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/3/med.00003.26.html">Monday, November 26, 1888</a>).<a href="#r1">[back]
