   <p>"A mere improvisation"! But what is the use, dear friend, of writing poems like this<sup><a href="#loc.07128_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
      to Harper's or any monthly or for the people who read such publications? If I know
      any thing of L. of G., or of you this is one of the most subtle, extraordinary
      little poems you have ever wrote and so far from its being done off-hand it seems
      to
      me deeper than the deepest study—even to follow in thought the (double)
      meaning of it makes me feel giddy as in looking up, up, into the far sky. But what's
      the use, not 10 people of all who read the piece in Lippencotts will have the
      remotest idea what it is about—but, along with the rest, by and by, the true
      readers will come, and you, and the rest of the Leaves, being understood, this will
      be also—that is as far as such fairy—
      etherial
      
       touches, hints, can be understood or comprehended.

   <p>Am glad to hear that the "belly ache" is easier—hope it has (or will soon)
      passed off entirely by this time.

   <p>All quiet here—pleasant autumn weather—cool, not too cold
      yet—pleasant driving—All same as ever with meter<sup><a href="#loc.07230_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—i.e. "getting
      ready to begin" manufacturing—I expect we shall commence turning out meters
      quite early in the year and I do not know but this is soon enough—all well and
      all goes well

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).
