      <br></br><br></br>Dear brother Walt,
      
   </p>
   
   <p>"Happy New Year" Walt, to you, is the wish and greeting of your Mother and brothers
      and sister in Brooklyn, and Hattie too says to send Happy new Year for her too to
      Uncle Walt. I received the letter that you wrote me in due time and yesterday Mother
      received one from you<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup> &nbsp;I wrote to you two letters<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and directed [them] to the "Delevan House, cor. of Pennsylvania and West Ninth Streets.["]<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> Dear Walt, what hours of trouble you must of past till you found George &nbsp;Mother and
      Mat each had a "good cry" yesterday in reading of how you had to get along, and I
      myself could hardly keep the water from my face &nbsp;If you had only been coming home
      they say, and lost your money, twould have been no matter &nbsp;but to loose it when you did not know how much you might need
      it on Georges account, must have made you felt miserable indeed.<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup> And then the damnable conduct of those "big bugs" (I believe the biggest bugs are
      ["]tumble turds") that you speak about must have made you feel doubly provoked.<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> But the most trying scene of all must have been your sight in front of the Hospital
      tent, not knowing how severely George was wounded. I should think that it would almost have been too much for you.<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n6" id="r6">6</a></sup> But thank God, it has all come out right, and George was not much hurt.
   </p>
   
   <p>I have written George, somewhat urging him to quit the army.<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n7" id="r7">7</a></sup> I think that it is the duty of all of us to urge this upon him, I honestly think
      that he has done enough and run risk enough for any one man. And too there is no judgement
      used in putting the old regiments in battle, they just keep throwing them in as long
      as there is a man left. If I belonged to one I am sure that it would look to me just
      as if they were bound to kill every man as long as the number of the Reg. was represented
      Walt do see and talk this matter over with him &nbsp;Speak with him of Mother, who is getting
      old very old, and if anything should happen [to] him I am quite sure she could not
      survive it &nbsp;Even now I can see the effect of the weeks worry that she has already
      had. &nbsp;Certainly no one could find any fault with him, or talk of him other than the
      bravest of the brave if he should resign to-morrow. And another thing I certanly do not see how this immense risk and sacrifice of life is doing any good at all, it looks very much to me as if we were slowly but surely drifting towards mediation
      or something worse. Walt, I beg of you, do not neglect to see George and put this
      thing in its strongest light. Just think for a moment of the number of suckers that
      are gaining all the real benefits of the war (if that is not wicked to say) and think
      of George and thousands of others running all the risk while they are drawing all
      the pay. Think of Dick Butt<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n8" id="r8">8</a></sup> and the thousand [other?] sneaks that we know. If he wont resign see if there is
      no possible way in which he can be removed for a while at least from his present place
      to one of less danger. Dear Walt I honestly think that he is carrying the life of
      our Mother, dear dear Mother with his own, and therefore I say tis our <em>duty</em>
      <sup><a href="#loc.00395_n9" id="r9">9</a></sup> to urge him to resign and his <em>duty</em>
      <sup><a href="#loc.00395_n10" id="r10">10</a></sup> to do it. Again and again let me say that if possible accomplish it<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n11" id="r11">11</a></sup>
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Friday 2nd. I intended to mail this to you yesterday but not having a stamp and not
      being able to get one could'nt do it. I have just taken dinner with Mat, Mother and Sis. on "Turkey." Knowing the
      locality you can imagine the whole performance to a niceity. I only wish that you and George had been with us, then the thing would have been complete. Mother is pretty well, but
      shows the effects of her anxiety about George, I think, quite plainly. On New Years
      Eve old Mr Turner<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n12" id="r12">12</a></sup> next door, died, quite suddenly I believe. The old man I saw out but a few days since
      &nbsp;Otherwise I beleve things are about as usual. &nbsp;How about you Walt, what are you trying to get to do.
      How about <em>Money</em>. If you get hard pushed let me know and I will try and raise you some. I am going
      along as usual, earning about half time with a "constant" prospect of doing better.
      Of course if you can poultice any thing so as to draw a little money out of it why
      do so, but dont be discouraged if you cant. I would rather see you and George come home to-gether than any amt of Green-backs.
      I understand that our old friend Bill Hart<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n13" id="r13">13</a></sup> is on here, wounded in the battle of Fredricksburg—, quite badly, but will recover.
      Mother sends her dearest love also Mat, ditto the rest of us. Write me at once and
      let me know how you are getting along. I was much, very much interested by your letters
      and want it repeated. Good bye dear Brother

   <p>Mother had a letter from Heyde to-day &nbsp;Han is quite well. Mary writes that Fanny is
      married<sup><a href="#loc.00395_n14" id="r14">14</a></sup>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,

      to Jeff of about December 28, 1862, is not extant. See Walt Whitman's letter to
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman of .<a href="#r1">[back]

   <p id="loc.00395_n2">2. These may be Jeff's

   <p id="loc.00395_n4">4. Whitman fell victim to
      a pickpocket in Philadelphia while changing trains en route to
      Washington.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n5">5. Whitman had written of
      his search for George among the numerous military hospitals in Washington and
      his frustration as he tried "to get access to big people." He complained that
      Moses Fowler Odell, a member of the House of Representatives from New York,
      "would not see me at all" (Edwin Haviland Miller, ed., <em>The
         Correspondence</em> [New York: New York University Press, 1961–77], 59
      n.3). "Tumble turds" is an Americanism for the common dung beetle.<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n6">6. Shortly before finding
      George at the Fredericksburg battle site, Walt Whitman had encountered "a heap
      of feet, arms, legs, &amp;c, under a tree in front [of] a hospital, the Lacy
      house" (Miller, 1:59).<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n7">7. Jeff's letter of about
      December 30, 1862, is not extant. George replied on , that he was thinking of requesting a furlough or
      perhaps even resigning.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n8">8. Richard Butt
      (1819–?), a Brooklyn surveyor, was appointed as a major in field and
      staff, First Regiment, New York Engineers, on December 3, 1861, and served until
      April 22, 1864. Jeff may consider him a "sneak" because his unit saw little
      action, spending most of its time in comparative safety at Fort Pulaski,
      Georgia.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n9">9. This word was double

      underlined in Jeff's letter for special emphasis.<a href="#r10">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n11">11. Jeff's continuing
      fears led Walt Whitman to remark on , "I feel that you and dearest mother are perhaps needlessly
      unhappy and morbid about our dear brother—to be in the army is a mixture of
      danger and <em>security</em> in this war which few realize—they
      think exclusively of the danger."<a href="#r11">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n12">12. David R. Turner was a
      house painter.<a href="#r12">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n13">13. Williiam G. Hart, a captain and acting
      assistant adjutant general in Company K of the Eighty-eighth New York
      Volunteers, suffered a gunshot wound in the right forearm on December 13, 1862,
      and was granted twenty days sick leave on December 15, 1862.<a href="#r13">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00395_n14">14. Charles Heyde repeatedly informed the
      Whitman family of Hannah's health. Mary Elizabeth Whitman Van Nostrand, Jeff's
      other sister, had married in 1840 and borne five children, of whom Fanny was the
      oldest.<a href="#r14">[back]
