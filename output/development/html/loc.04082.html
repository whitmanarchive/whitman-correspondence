   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.04082_n1">1. This letter was cut up
      and used as scrap paper by Whitman for preparing his Lincoln lectures.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3000">2. In January 1878, Whitman sent Peter
      Doyle a copy of his poem "Autumn Rivulets" and a <em>West Jersey
         Press</em> story about the poet (<em>Daybooks and
         Notebooks</em>, ed. William White [New York: New York University Press,
      1978] 1:79).<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0752">3. Peter Doyle (1843â€“1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
