   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="loc.07688_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Dr Bucke | Asylum | London | Ontario Canada.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n0625">2. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) succeeded
      William Wordsworth as poet laureate of Great Britain in 1850. The intense male
      friendship described in <em>In Memoriam</em>, which Tennyson wrote
      after the death of his friend Arthur Henry Hallam, possibly influenced Whitman's
      poetry. Tennyson began a correspondence with Whitman on . Although Tennyson extended an invitation for Whitman
      to visit England, Whitman never acted on the offer.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.07688_n2">3. Whitman is referring to the
      engraving of Tennyson on page 482 of volume 38 of <em>The Century
         Illustrated Monthly Magazine</em> (August 1889).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n7501">4. Thomas Johnson (1843–1904)
      worked as an engraver in Brooklyn, New York. He did engravings of Walt Whitman,
      Abraham Lincoln, and the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ("Johnson, Thomas," <em>Benezit Dictionary of Artists</em> [Oxford: University of
      Oxford Press, 2011]).<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">5. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
