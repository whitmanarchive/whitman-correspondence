   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="n0839">1. Robert "Bob" Green Ingersoll
      (1833–1899) was a Civil War veteran and an orator of the post-Civil War
      era, known for his support of agnosticism. Ingersoll was a friend of Whitman,
      who considered Ingersoll the greatest orator of his time. Whitman said to
      Traubel, "It should not be surprising that I am drawn to Ingersoll, for he is
      <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. He lives, embodies, the
      individuality I preach. I see in Bob the noblest
      specimen—American-flavored—pure out of the soil, spreading, giving,
      demanding light" (Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/8/med.00008.43.html">Wednesday, March 25, 1891</a>). The feeling was mutual. Upon Whitman's
      death in 1892, Ingersoll delivered the eulogy at the poet's funeral. The eulogy
      was published to great acclaim and is considered a classic panegyric (see
      Phyllis Theroux, <em>The Book of Eulogies</em> [New York: Simon
      &amp; Schuster, 1997], 30).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02917_n1">2. William Ewart Gladstone
      (1809–1898) was a British politician, serving as Prime Minister for four
      separate terms. The essay Macculloch mentions responds to Ingersoll's "Letter to
      Dr. Field," which appeared in the January 1888 issue. Near its conclusion,
      Ingersoll asserts his agnostic views, "Neither in the interest of truth, nor for
      the benefit of man, is it necessary to assert what we do not know. No cause is
      great enough to demand a sacrifice of candor. The mysteries of life and death,
      of good and evil, have never yet been solved." In response, Galdstone writes,
      "How good, how wise are these words! But coming at the close of the controversy,
      have they not some of the ineffectual features of a death-bed repentance?"
      Ingersoll's June letter furthered the debate then being promoted by <em>The North American Review</em> as the Ingersoll-Gladstone
      Controversy.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n6004">3. Charles Allen Thorndike Rice
      (1851–1889) purchased <em>The North American Review</em> in
      1876 and was its publisher, editor, and overall proprietor until his death in
      1889.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02917_n2">4. Macculloch is referring to a
      collection of essays on Abraham Lincoln edited by Allen Thorndike Rice. Featured
      authors included Ulysses S. Grant, Frederick Douglass, Henry Ward Beecher, and
      various Congressmen, governors, and journalists. See <em>Reminiscences of Abraham Lincoln: by distinguished men of his time.</em>
