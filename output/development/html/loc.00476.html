      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt
      
   </p>
   
   <p>Tis a long time since I have heard from any of you—but I suppose all goes about
      the same as ever. I suppose you have had all sorts of newspaper rumors in regard to
      the
      yellow fever in St Louis<sup><a href="#loc.00476_n1" id="r1">1</a></sup>—but the truth is that the
      stories are nearly entirely fabrications Altogether
      there has been, probably, some 35 to 40 deaths by yellow fever during the
      season—out of this number some 6 or 8 were St Louis people who had been in some
      capacity about those that had come from the South—or had been connected with the
      hospital boat that carries the sick people from the city to the fever hospital. I
      have
      no doubt but that had the weather continued warm for a couple or three weeks longer
      we
      should have had quite a touch 
      
      of the trouble. From what I can observe I judge the spread
      of this disease is simply a question of time That it
      always commences in the south (so far as the West is concerned at any rate) is a
      fact—that it will progress with quite a certain rate of travel—now if the
      time between its first breaking out and where it meets a heavy frost is long enough
      I do
      not see why it should not spread to the lakes. This season it broke out in New Orleans
         
      abt
      
       6 weeks earlier than usual—we have had rather a backward season as regards
      frost and cool weather—the disease was quite bad within 
      abt
      
       150 miles of
      us—I think more favorable conditions would undoubtedly have produced it
      here—Steamboats seem to be the home of the disease—let one of them be in the
      locality when the sickness is bad and it is pretty sure death to have anything to
      do
      with it—this does not seem to be the case with R. R. cars—Another thing
      seems sure and that is that with proper sanitary laws—with good energetic health
      officers—no city that is kept decently clean but what can stamp out the disease by
      taking prompt action
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I do not know that you are interested in all this, but I have been pretty well exercised
      about the matter, knowing that if it did come here I should have to stop and face
      the
      music no matter how bad it became—We have had several cool nights—and to-day
      the weather is what might be called cold—I think we will have a decided show of
      ice to-night—and so the question of fever for this season is certainly disposed
      of.
   </p>
   
   <p>I am getting on reasonably well have pretty good health—indeed just now it is
      extremely good—at one time—near the latter part of July I got 
      
      poisened
      
      
      
       by
      the bad air of the numerous sewers, bone boiling and fat rendering establishments
      that I
      had to visit<sup><a href="#loc.00476_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> and was badly off for a couple of
      weeks—and indeed did not feel well until we had a "cold wave" about two weeks
      ago—since that time I have felt the very best—and too my work has let up
      very much
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How are you all getting on How is George and Lou and Ed and yourself—I hope you
      continue to gain—I judge from what Hattie writes that you made quite headway this
      last summer I hope so and am very glad. What is new with you are you doing anything
      in
      the way of books—I dont see anything in the papers<sup><a href="#loc.00476_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup>—but then the papers I see would not be apt to say much anyhow—except in a
      mean way. Has George got through his foundry work—and if so I suppose is mostly on
      his farm<sup><a href="#loc.00476_n4" id="r4">4</a></sup>—Will you make a winter trip to your New York
      friends if so you must call and see Worthen<sup><a href="#loc.00476_n5" id="r5">5</a></sup> I have just
      had a letter from Hattie in which I learn that she is a little sick—has been laid
      off from study—I hope she is not sick to any extent—indeed I sincerely hope
      she is all right now—I have just written her to-night to let the study go and get
      well as quick as she can—I hope to hear in a day or two that she is all well
      again
   </p>
   
   <p>Give my love to all—write me when you feel like it and give me all the news.—</p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was Walt Whitman's favorite brother. As a
      civil engineer, Jeff eventually became Superintendent of Water Works in St.
      Louis and a nationally recognized figure. For more on Jeff, see Randall Waldron,
      "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.00476_n1">1. Only ten "local cases"
      of yellow fever were reported in St. Louis this season; the other individuals
      came up from New Orleans.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00476_n2">2. Because of the rapid
      growth of the city, the Bissell's Point Water Works was increasingly vulnerable
      to pollution from slaughterhouse waste and sewage.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00476_n3">3. Whitman was not working
      on a book at this time, but he frequently published poems and essays in
      periodicals. Around October 26, 1878, he sent Jeff "Gathering the Corn"; on
      November 25, 1878, "Thou who has Slept all Night upon the Storm" (later titled
      "To the Man-of-War Bird"); at the end of January 1879, "Winter Sunshine: A Trip
      from Camden to the Coast"; on August 9, 1879, an account of the lecture on the
      death of Abraham Lincoln (<em>Walt Whitman: Daybooks and
         Notebooks</em>, ed. William White [New York: New York University Press,
      1978], 118, 122, 35, 152). Whitman sent Jeff similar items in the following
      years. It seems unlikely that the poet would have sent materials to Jeff this
      often if he really believed that no family member sympathized with his work (see
      Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price's introduction to <em>Dear
         Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman</em> [Kent, Ohio: Kent
      State University Press, 1984]).<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.00476_n4">4. Probably the farm in
      Burlington, New Jersey, where George Washington Whitman would eventually build a
      permanent home in 1884.<a href="#r4">[back]
