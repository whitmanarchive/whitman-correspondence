      James S. Redfield, a publisher at 140 Fulton Street, New York, was a
      distributor of Whitman's books in the early 1870s. On March 23, 1872,
      Redfield accepted 496 copies of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>: "I
      am to account to him (for all that I may sell) at the rate of One Dollar
      &amp; Fifty Cents a copy, (1.50)" (Charles E. Feinberg Collection of the
      Papers of Walt Whitman, 1839–1919, Library of Congress, Washington,
      D.C.).<br><br>
      When Whitman prepared his will on October 23, 1872, he noted that Redfield
      had 500 copies of the fifth edition of <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em>, 400 copies of <em>As a Strong Bird on Pinions
         Free</em>, and 500 copies of <em>Democratic Vistas</em>
      (The Trent Collection of Whitmaniana, Duke University Rare Book, Manuscript,
      and Special Collections Library). Redfield later established a London outlet
      for <em>Democratic Vistas</em> and <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> with Sampson, Low, Marston, Low, and Searle, who, on , transferred Redfield's account
      for the remaining books to Whitman. On , when his firm was in bankruptcy, Redfield noted that the
      balance due Whitman ($63.45) "will have to go in with my general
      indebtedness. I think my estate will pay 50 cents on the dollar: hope so at
      any rate." He suggested that Michael Doolady and the new Boston firm of
      Estes and Lauriat might agree to handle his books; Doolady was the
      bookseller and publisher mentioned in Whitman's  letter to Dionysius Thomas and in Whitman's  letter to Doolady. He printed
      Ada Clare's 1866 book <em>Only a Woman's Heart</em>. He noted,
      however, that most book dealers were unwilling to sell Whitman's books,
      either because of inadequate sales or because of the poet's reputation in
      respectable circles: "It is only here and there a speckled sheep, like J. S.
      R., turns up who—not to put too fine a point upon it—don't care
      a d--n for Mrs Grundy, who would take you in."<a href="#r1">[back]
