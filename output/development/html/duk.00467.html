   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (1795–1873) married
      Walter Whitman, Sr., in 1816; together they had nine children, of whom Walt was
      the second. The close relationship between Louisa and her son Walt contributed
      to his liberal view of gender representation and his sense of comradeship. For
      more information on Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_69.html">Whitman, Louisa Van Velsor (1795–1873)</a>."

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="duk.00467_n8">1. March 26, 1866 is the most
      likely date for this letter. Richard Maurice Bucke dated the letter to late
      March 1866. Edwin Haviland Miller assigned the approximate date of March 27,
      1866 (Walt Whitman, <em>The Correspondence</em> [New York: New
      York University Press, 1961–77], 1:272, n. 5). It is possible that the
      letter dates as early as March 25, 1866, but that is probably too early because
      Louisa Van Velsor Whitman forwarded to Walt Whitman a letter she had received
      from daughter Hannah Heyde, which dates to March 24, 1866. It is also possible,
      but unlikely, that this letter dates to as late as March 27, 1866, but this late
      date is unlikely because Walt acknowledged receipt of Louisa's letter "this
      morning" with Hannah's letter enclosed on March 28, 1866 (see Walt's  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n1">2. Hannah Louisa (Whitman)
      Heyde (1823–1908) was the youngest daughter of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      and Walter Whitman, Sr. She lived in Burlington, Vermont with her husband
      Charles Heyde (1822–1892), a landscape painter.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00422_n2">3. Thomas Jefferson Whitman
      (1833–1890), known as "Jeff," was the son of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and
      Walter Whitman, Sr., and Walt Whitman's favorite brother. In early adulthood he
      worked as a surveyor and topographical engineer. In the 1850s he began working
      for the Brooklyn Water Works, at which he remained employed through the Civil
      War. In 1867 Jeff became Superintendent of Water Works in St. Louis and became a
      nationally recognized name in civil engineering. For more on Jeff, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_70.html">Whitman, Thomas Jefferson (1833–1890)</a>."<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n2">4. George Washington Whitman
      (1829–1901) was the sixth child of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman and Walter
      Whitman, Sr., and ten years Walt Whitman's junior. George enlisted in the Union
      Army in 1861 and remained on active duty until the end of the Civil War. He was
      wounded in the First Battle of Fredericksburg (December 1862) and was taken
      prisoner during the Battle of Poplar Grove (September 1864). After the war,
      George returned to Brooklyn and began building houses on speculation, with a
      partner named Smith and later a mason named French. George eventually took up a
      position as inspector of pipes in Brooklyn and Camden. For more information on
      George, see "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_68.html">Whitman, George Washington</a>."<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n14">5. This lot on Putnam Avenue,
      which was purchased by George Washington Whitman's partner Smith and housed
      their carpentry shop, long occupied Louisa Van Velsor Whitman as a potential
      spot for a home. After George and his partner decided not to build there (see
      Louisa's  letter to Walt Whitman), she
      asked Walt whether he could purchase this lot so that she could have there a
      small home for herself (see her  letter to Walt).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n7">6. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman
      wrote "birmingham" but meant Burlington, Vermont, where her daughter Hannah
      Heyde and son-in-law Charles L. Heyde lived. Louisa had visited them in
      September 1865. While on her visit she referred twice to Burlington as
      "birmingham" (see her  and  letters). Burlington is on Lake
      Champlain, across from Port Kent, New York. Vermont has no city or town named
      Birmingham.<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00425_n13">7. Edward Whitman
      (1835–1892), called "Eddy" or "Edd," was the youngest son of Louisa Van
      Velsor Whitman and Walter Whitman, Sr. He required lifelong assistance for
      significant physical and mental disabilities, and he remained in the care of his
      mother until her death. During Louisa's final illness, Eddy was taken under the
      care of George Washington Whitman and his wife, Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman, with
      financial support from Walt Whitman.<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n6">8. The Brown family boarded in
      the same house as the Whitmans on Portland Avenue in Brooklyn. In 1860, the
      lower part of the house was rented to John Brown, a tailor. The relationship
      between the Browns and the Whitmans was often strained, but the Browns remained
      in the Portland Avenue house for five years. See Thomas Jefferson Whitman's  and  letters to Walt Whitman.<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="duk.00467_n9">9. Walt Whitman did not find
      this assurance sufficiently specific. He sought to confirm Louisa Van Velsor
      Whitman's receipt of all three of his letters from the previous week: "Mother, I
      wrote you three letters last week, the second one was in a big envelope, &amp;
      the last was a small one you ought to have got Saturday" (see his  letter to Louisa).<a href="#r9">[back]
