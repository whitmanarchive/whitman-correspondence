      <br></br><br></br>My dear Walt:
      
   </p>
   
   <p> I duly got your letter of May 5th and was very glad to hear from you. I sent you
      a
      letter which came for you on Monday, and which I hope
      you got, and herewith enclose another which Ramsdell left for you.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I earnestly hope George will be better when this reaches you. We all felt sobered
      to know that
      he was so badly. The turn in the weather today,
      I think will be good for him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I can well imagine how you must have felt to see him so, and how sad it must be for
       your mother.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I enclose a letter I got from that child of a burnt father, Allen, which you can bring back with you when you come. It is truly Pecksniffian, and
      seems to have been written on all—fours. You will see that it ends the matter
      of publishing the book, and he doesn't say a word about John Burroughs' book, but
      of
      course that is understood to be declined also. I have written him, saying that John
      will at once put the book to press himself.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I had another letter from Raymond yesterday, very kind  and friendly. He evidently does not yet
      know of the Allen–Carleton decision. Part of it is about my coming upon the
      <u>Times</u>—a sort of hankering treatment of the
      subject, but no offer, which of course he
      couldn't well make, not knowing exactly how useful or available my talent would be
      to him. He has not heard that I was in New York. I shall write him—today,
      if I can.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I think, on the whole, it is probably altogether best that Carleton should have
      nothing to do with "Leaves of Grass,"
      though I
      would well enough like him to publish the "Notes."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>—I write in a hurry, nearly  on mail time. Nelly charged me to send you her love. Your letter
      was very sweet. I think a young girl finding herself beloved or admired by some one
      unsuspected before, must feel as I did when I read how the household thought of me.
      But I didn't lay myself out at all, as you say, and moreover, the evening I was
      there I had a shocking headache.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Give my loving remembrance to all, especially your mother. I have not yet succeeded
      in telling you (you know we were interrupted each time we began to talk of it,) how
      deeply she affected me. Her cheerfulness, her infinite gentleness and tenderness,
      were  like the deep  smile of the evening
      sky. As I saw her that night, with the children on each side, and each leaning a
      head upon her, I thought of the Madonna grown old.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Charley bade me send you his love. He has been in the most extraordinary jolly humor
      all this week. It is as if the Cheeryble Brothers were
      rolled into one. The <u>Times</u> has done him the recent
      honor of copying at length, and
      devoting an editorial to, besides, one of his late letters to the <u>Standard</u>, in which he comes the bloody Roman centurion on
      a batch of politicians,
      sparing not one.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>H. Clapp will end by becoming a respectable citizen. When once a man enters upon the
      downward path, &amp;c. Like De Quincey's warning against the practice of <u>murder</u>, on the ground that it leads to procrastination and
      Sabbath breaking, so one  can see
      as the guilty result of Bohemianism, a place in the Common Council or Board of
      Aldermen!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Good bye.
      
      I hope George is better today.
