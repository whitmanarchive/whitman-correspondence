   <p>Rather warm weather—moist and sweaty, suits me—I am sitting up in the big
      chair this afternoon—looking languidly at the proof &amp; copy for the
      printers<sup><a href="#loc.07510_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup>—they &amp; the boss are kind &amp; indulgent to me—so far I
      like them &amp; the work—had a bowel motion this morning (took a calomel
      powder last night)—I eat my meals every time, one at a time (rather
      moderately) so far yesterday—have eaten stew'd chicken—oatmeal
      gruel—strawberries—&amp;c. I had two moderate roast apples for my supper
      Mrs. Harned<sup><a href="#n4134" id="r3">3</a></sup> sent me—Oesler<sup><a href="#n4302" id="r4">4</a></sup> was here
      every day—is faithful—was here two hours ago—Baker<sup><a href="#loc.07541_n2" id="r5">5</a></sup> is here &amp; devoted—is very cautious (I wanted to take
      a calomel powder last night, but he was not willing to do it till he had your or
      Oesler's authority first)—Hadn't I better take these powders ab't twice a
      month, following them with the bitter water—in the chronic condition I seem to
      be in they seem to bring better result than any thing else—
   </p>
   
   <p>Pete Doyle<sup><a href="#n0752" id="r6">6</a></sup> was over this evening—I was real glad to see
      him—he only staid two minutes—Horace Traubel<sup><a href="#n4267" id="r7">7</a></sup> has
      been—the printers move on quite lively—I have had a pretty good hour
      feeling on the 9 hour turning to night—If I can get over the great debility
      &amp; the bad feeling (jellity &amp; soreness &amp; half pain) in my head, spells
      frequent, <em>then</em> I shall feel I am getting on ahead—
   </p>
   
   <p><em>Saturday June 16—2½ P M</em></p>
   
   <p>It is certain I hold the main in mend &amp; eat moderately &amp; have another bowel
      movement to day—but I keep very weak—head is uncomfortable—To day
      is hot &amp; stuffy, but I don't mind—

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Richard Maurice Bucke (1837–1902) was a
      Canadian physician and psychiatrist who grew close to Whitman after reading <em>Leaves of Grass</em> in 1867 (and later memorizing it) and
      meeting the poet in Camden a decade later. Even before meeting Whitman, Bucke
      claimed in 1872 that a reading of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> led him
      to experience "cosmic consciousness" and an overwhelming sense of epiphany.
      Bucke became the poet's first biographer with <em>Walt
         Whitman</em> (Philadelphia: David McKay, 1883), and he later served as one
      of his medical advisors and literary executors. For more on the relationship of
      Bucke and Whitman, see Howard Nelson, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_77.html">Bucke, Richard Maurice</a>," <em>Walt Whitman: An
         Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York:
      Garland Publishing, 1998).

   <p id="n4134">3. Augusta Anna Traubel Harned

   <p id="n4302">4. Sir William Osler (1849–1919)
      was a Canadian physician and one of the four founding staff members of Johns
      Hopkins Hospital, where he served as the first Chief of Medicine. Richard
      Maurice Bucke introduced Osler to Whitman in 1885 in order to care for the aging
      poet. Osler wrote a manuscript about his personal and professional relationship
      with Whitman in 1919; see <em>Walt Whitman and Sir William Osler:
         A Poet and his Physician</em> [Toronto: ECW Press, 1995]). For more on

   <p id="loc.07541_n2">5. Nathan M. Baker was one
      of Whitman's caregivers. He would leave on July 15, 1888, to resume his medical
      training. Baker was replaced by W.A. Musgrove. For Whitman's comments on the
      transition, see Horace Traubel, <em>With Walt Whitman in
         Camden</em>, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/traubel/WWWiC/2/med.00002.2.html">Monday, July 16, 1888</a>.<a href="#r5">[back]

   <p id="n0752">6. Peter Doyle (1843–1907) was
      one of Walt Whitman's closest comrades and lovers, and their friendship spanned
      nearly thirty years. The two met in 1865 when the twenty-one-year-old Doyle was
      a conductor in the horsecar where the forty-five-year-old Whitman was a
      passenger. Despite his status as a veteran of the Confederate Army, Doyle's
      uneducated, youthful nature appealed to Whitman. Although Whitman's stroke in
      1873 and subsequent move from Washington to Camden limited the time the two
      could spend together, their relationship rekindled in the mid-1880s after Doyle
      moved to Philadelphia and visited nearby Camden frequently. After Whitman's
      death, Doyle permitted Richard Maurice Bucke to publish the letters Whitman had
      sent him. For more on Doyle and his relationship with Whitman, see Martin G.
      Murray, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_3.html">Doyle, Peter</a>."<a href="#r6">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4267">7. Horace L. Traubel (1858–1919)
      was an American essayist, poet, and magazine publisher. He is best remembered as
      the literary executor, biographer, and self-fashioned "spirit child" of Walt
      Whitman. During the mid-1880s and until Whitman's death in 1892, Traubel visited
      the poet virtually every day and took thorough notes of their conversations,
      which he later transcribed and published in three large volumes entitled <em>With Walt Whitman in Camden</em> (1906, 1908, &amp; 1914).
      After his death, Traubel left behind enough manuscripts for six more volumes of
      the series, the final two of which were published in 1996. For more on Traubel,
      see Ed Folsom, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_60.html">Traubel, Horace L. [1858–1919]</a>,"<em> Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia,</em> ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r7">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n2002">8. William Douglas O'Connor
      (1832–1889) was the author of the grand and grandiloquent Whitman pamphlet
      "The Good Gray Poet," published in 1866 (a digital version of the pamphlet is
      available at "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00170.html">The Good Gray Poet: A Vindication</a>"). For more on Whitman's
      relationship with O'Connor, see Deshae E. Lott, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_41.html">O'Connor, William Douglas (1832–1889)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r8">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n4137">9. Ellen M. "Nelly" O'Connor was the
      wife of William D. O'Connor (1832–1889), one of Whitman's staunchest
      defenders. Whitman dined with the O'Connors frequently during his Washington
      years. Though Whitman and William O'Connor would temporarily break off their
      friendship in late 1872 over Reconstruction policies with regard to emancipated
      black citizens, Ellen would remain friendly with Whitman. The correspondence
      between Whitman and Ellen is almost as voluminous as the poet's correspondence
      with William. For more on Whitman's relationship with the O'Connors, see Dashae
      E. Lott, <a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/disciples/tei/anc.00251.html">"William Douglas O'Connor,"</a>
