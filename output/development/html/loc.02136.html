      <br></br><br></br>Dear Mr. Whitman:
      
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I saw lately that you were not so well—but hope it is a newspaper report merely
      and that you are continuing to gain. I saw Mrs. Dr. Spaulding<sup><a href="#loc.02136_n2" id="r2">2</a></sup> recently she is doing all she can for the acceptance of
      L. of G.—By the way I found a lover where I least expected it, in Mr. Hezekiah
      Butterworth<sup><a href="#loc.02136_n3" id="r3">3</a></sup> of the "Youths Companion." Who said when
      I invited him to hear the lecture upon your work—"I shall come by all means. I
      think Whitman one of the greatest if not the greatest of our American poets."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>He is not afraid of your work but wishes some of it were left out of it, for a
      popular volume. He would think it all right in itself I presume—Mrs.
      Moulton<sup><a href="#n5000" id="r4">4</a></sup> has gone south for a month. Returns in—May I
      hope she may be able to see you before she sails for England in June.—
      Kennedy<sup><a href="#n3039" id="r5">5</a></sup> I never see now. Dont know what he is doing. I
      should like to see him very much. I am digging away in a fair way to earn a
      living.
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>I gave two evenings to your work before my class at New England Conservatory. My
      class is composed of about fifty bright young girls studying music. You see I am not
      afraid to carry your word To anyone. To me there is not a line that has a downward
      tending. Still I recognzie the fact that to many people "A woman waits for me" is
      wholly inadmissable, and I know that the rest of the book is a sealed book to
      them<sup><a href="#loc.02136_n4" id="r6">6</a></sup>—perhaps it would be anyway—there's consolation there. I shall have
      "Specimen Days" in my class during Spring term.
   </p>

   <p><em>Correspondent:</em><br>Alexander Gardner (1821–1882)
      of Paisley, Scotland, was a publisher who reissued a number of books by and
      about Whitman; he ultimately published William Sloane Kennedy's <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> in 1896 after a long and
      contentious battle with Kennedy over editing the book. Gardner published and
      co-edited the <em>Scottish Review</em> from 1882 to 1886.

   <h4>Notes:</h4>
   <p id="loc.02136_n1">1. This letter is addressed:
      Walt Whitman | 328 Mickle st. | Camden New Jersey. It is postmarked: Jamaica
      Plains Sta Mass. | Apr | 3 | 8PM | 1889; Received | Apr | 4 | 1130AM | 1889 |
      Phila; Philadelphia, Pa | Apr | 4 | (?)30AM | 1889 | Transit; (?) N.J. | Apr | 4
      | (?) | (?) | (?)D.<a href="#r1">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02136_n2">2. Mrs. Ada H. Spaulding, of
      Boston, was an admirer of Whitman who praised him publicly. On March 17, 1889
      she visited Whitman in Camden. When she returned to Boston, she wrote to thank
      him for the visit; on March 28, 1889, she sent Whitman flowers.<a href="#r2">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02136_n3">3. Hezekiah Butterworth
      (1839-1905). He was assistant editor (1870-1904) of <em>The
         Youth's Companion</em>, a prominent Boston weekly magazine for children.
      Garland published two poems in <em>The Youth's Companion</em> in
      1889: "A Dakota Wheat Field," which appeared in the July 18 issue, and "By the
      River," which appeared in the August 15 number.<a href="#r3">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n5000">4. As yet we have no information about
      this correspondent.<a href="#r4">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="n3039">5. William Sloane Kennedy
      (1850–1929) was on the staff of the Philadelphia <em>American</em> and later published biographies of Longfellow and Whittier
      (<em>Dictionary of American Biography</em>). Apparently
      Kennedy had called on the poet for the first time on November 21, 1880 (William
      Sloane Kennedy, <em>Reminiscences of Walt Whitman</em> [1896], 1).
      Though Kennedy was to become a fierce defender of Whitman, in his first
      published article he admitted reservations about the "coarse indecencies of
      language" and protested that Whitman's ideal of democracy was "too coarse and
      crude"; see <em>The Californian</em>, 3 (February 1881), 149–158.
      For more about Kennedy, see Katherine Reagan, "<a href="http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_99.html">Kennedy, William Sloane (1850–1929)</a>," <em>Walt
         Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em>, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New
      York: Garland Publishing, 1998).<a href="#r5">[back]
         </a></p>
   <p id="loc.02136_n4">6. In 1882, "A Woman Waits for
      Me" and "To a Common Prostitute" were two of the poems that the Boston district
      attorney referred to when officially classifying <em>Leaves of
         Grass</em> as an obscene book.<a href="#r6">[back]
